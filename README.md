The hypotheses to be tested include whether sentiment analysis can identify stock market events quicker and more accurately than traditional models, the correlation between the volatility of large-cap and small-cap stocks like AAPL and ACMR respectively, the influence of one stock's movement on other stocks, and the relevance of specific keywords or tickers in predicting stock market movement. The study aims to improve upon previous research exploring the use of alternative keywords and tickers beyond those previously identified and applying sentiment analysis on these but not limited to those data.
