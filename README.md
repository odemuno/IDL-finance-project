# Leveraging Deep Learning to Forecast Stock Market Volatility via News Headlines and Social Media Sentiment Analysis

  This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of using sentiment analysis techniques on data obtained from multiple news sources, namely Webull, Twitter, and Reddit, to predict stock price differences during the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on two companies, one large-cap (Zoom) and one small-cap (AMC), to explore the correlation between market sentiment and stock price movement. The process of scraping data from social media and news sources will be described, followed by the methodology used for sentiment analysis and stock price difference prediction using deep learning models. The study aims to provide insights into the usefulness of social media data for predicting stock market trends, as well as the impact of market capitalization on this relationship. This study has the potential to contribute to the existing body of research on alternative data sources and sentiment analysis in predicting stock market behavior.
