I had an idea of how it might be adapted, but I can't backtest it as far as I'd like.

It is by using $QYLD, possibly to alleviate the dangers of sideways movement in the market. The trouble is, I can't backtest QYLD beyond January 2014.

Does anyone have any thoughts? Is there a way to backtest?",2020-01-28 18:56:44

4,Diversification isn't working,"To start off, I am a 32 year old with a very stable job, a fiance, and no kids. I live in NYC and rent a relatively cheap place and hold no debt. I've been investing passively in ETFs for the past 5 years, I built my portfolio on the principles of others; it's important to diversify your positions by investing in a broad portfolio including domestic and foreign markets.  Here are some of my experiences:

Investing in foreign markets has been a waste of time. Domestic stocks have outperformed both large cap European ones, as well as emerging markets by a large margin. While foreign holdings aren't correlated to domestic in bull markets, they are correlated in bears. America's market drags on the world, but not the other way around.

Targeted ETFs that are supposed to reduce volatility also do not work. Since the new year, I've been worried about asset valuations and have been reducing my positions.

5,Motley Fool Tom's Best Buy Now (13 Feb 20),"An excerpt from the Stock Advisor newsletter.

**Appian** (NASDAQ: APPN) is making its fifth Best Buys Now appearance in the past seven months as it continues to make coding more accessible to the masses. Obviously, we still like this stock. Consider this an opportunity to add to or start a position today.

It's been heady times for **Tesla** (NASDAQ: TSLA) after a 2019 that was full of crises. The stock price reached a low of $176.99 in June of last year, and since then, it's been a four-bagger. Some of this is probably due to a short squeeze — those who borrowed shares to bet against the stock are being forced to buy them back to cover their bets. But more importantly, we think the market is beginning to realize that it may have overestimated the competition being mounted by the incumbent automakers

Let's face it, if you don't know what **The Trade Desk** (NASDAQ: TTD) does by now — after being named nine times to the Best Buys Now list over the past 14 months and being rerecommended by Tom a few short months ago 
**
Slack Technologies**' (NYSE: WORK) stock has had a volatile couple months since the company went public and Tom recommended it, down more than 11% versus a gain of more than 13% for the S&P 500 over the same period. Slack's rich valuation at the start, coupled with a market shift away from growth at any price, has caused shares to fall, but the overall long-term opportunity remains positive.

With today's inclusion, video conferencing company **Zoom Communications** (NASDAQ: ZM) has been named a Best Buy Now five consecutive times. Nothing much has happened with the company since last month, so we're looking forward to its March 4 earnings release for fourth-quarter and full-year 2019.

----

A week ago, Tom issued a Buy Recommendation of Invitae, saying:

Healthcare is a hotbed of innovation, and genomics has the potential to transform the healthcare industry forever. Over the past 30 years, scientists have mapped the entire human genome, and doing basic genetic testing has gotten a whole lot cheaper. Among the companies in this space, we think **Invitae** (NYSE: NVTA) has what it takes to take genomics to the next level by making genetic testing truly accessible to all — and make its shareholders rich in the process.

----

**On a personal note...**

* Appian has only outperformed the S&P 500 since 14 Jan 20.

* Tesla ~~needs no introduction~~ has outperformed the S&P 500 if you bought it before 14 May 13.  Over the past 1-year, it has outperformed since 18 Dec 19.

* The Trade Desk has outperformed the S&P 500 in the past 1-year, and since 24 May 17.

* Slack Technologies is a new stock but has only outperformed the S&P 500 since 10 Feb 20.  

* Zoom is another new stock and a competitor, I believe, of Slack.  It has only outperformed the S&P 500 since 31 Jan 20.

* Invitae has only outperformed the S&P 500 since 31 Jan 20.  It has underperformed over the 5-year period.

8,ALERT: $ZOM Receives FDA Approval,"2/21/20 06:59:00: FDA Approves New Drugs For Canine Health

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center of Veterinary Medicine on Friday approved ZM-007 Metronidazole Oral Suspension and ZM-012 Metronidazole Tablet. This will provide new and easier ways to treat companion animals.

ZM-012 is a canine-specific tablet formulation to replace the large, bitter-tasting generic tablet designed for humans. ZM-007 is an oral suspension formulation that provides veterinarians the ability to accurately dose smaller breeds and puppies without compounding pharmacies.

Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (ZOM) developed these formulations to establish safe and effective doses of metronidazole to treat diarrhea in dogs, rather than relying on efficacy and safety data extrapolated from human studies and using tablets or suspensions produced for human use.

Marketing on these newly approved drugs is estimated to start in Q1 2021 and analysts estimate the drugs could generate annual sales of $1.2 billion by 2027.

Short SPY- we are not done bleeding. The first massive outbreak reported will take the market down. Short CMG-  it’s just matter of time before spread starts in fast food and CMG is seems to take bad news bad.  Downside already started due to hedge fund reducing exposure last quarter. 

Be very careful going long.  This virus has the similarities of 1918-1919 flue.  Started around this time in 1918 and by summer it had died down- but winter if 1918/19 it came back hard. So unless a vaccine is coming between now and early fall, manage your longs even if the virus goes dormant.  


Btw- for the folks that say flue kills more people every year than this corona. - flu killed 34,000 people last year yes but it affected 35,000,000 people. That is a   0.1 morality rate.  If/when corona affects 35,000,000 people it will be 700K death.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020.

# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**
*****
> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500′s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.
*****
> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.
*****
> “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”
*****
> Weekend action?
> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.
*****
> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.
*****
> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.
*****
> Cutting forecasts
> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.
*****
> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.
*****
> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.
*****
> “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.
*****
> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.
*****
> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.

# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19

> The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.

> “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”

> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.

> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**

> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**

> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.

# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?

> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.

> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**

> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.

# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off

> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**

> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**

> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.

# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)

> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**

> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**

> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**

> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**

> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**

> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.

# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs

> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.

> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

# Just Four S&P 500 Stocks Up This Week

> There's still another day left in the week, but unless things improve on Friday this will go down as one of the worst weeks for US equities in history. Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**

> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.

> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",2020-02-29 10:49:03
20,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020.

# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**
*****
> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500′s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.
*****
> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.
*****
> “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”
*****
> Weekend action?
> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.
*****
> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.
*****
> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.
*****
> Cutting forecasts
> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.
*****
> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.
*****
> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.
*****
> “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.
*****
> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.
*****
> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.

# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19

> The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.

> “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”

> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.

> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**

> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**

> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.

# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?

> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.

> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**

> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.

# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off

> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**

> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**

> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.

# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)

> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**

> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**

> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**

> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**

> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**

> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.

# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs

> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.

> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

# Just Four S&P 500 Stocks Up This Week

> There's still another day left in the week, but unless things improve on Friday this will go down as one of the worst weeks for US equities in history. Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).

> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.

> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?

27,Thought my ZM calls were doomed after hours yesterday. Pleasantly surprised today,,2020-03-05 10:38:51
28,Simple Bear Market Strategy for Small Investors,"Most small investors don't know how to make money in a bear market. Their stock strategy is ""buy and hold."" They ONLY buy stocks (and funds) they believe will INCREASE in ~~value.~~ price.

Right now they're madly buying Clorox, Netflix, Zoom, INST, Invio, stocks they expect to buck the market. and go UP.

**What are some investments you could make that will earn you money when you expect stock prices and the overall market to continue to go DOWN?**

Investments that go UP when the Dow or S&P goes DOWN include  A) Selling individual stocks short, B) buying PUT options  C) Bonds,  D) Certain ""Negative"" index funds,  E) Precious metals, or precious metal funds, mining companies, etc.   **In this article I'm going to try to convince you to go with ""D,"" Negative Index Funds.**

**A) What is ""Selling short?**"" You ""sell"" a stock at today's higher price --- agreeing to deliver it in 90 days or whatever -- expecting it to decline in price between now and then. You pocket the difference.

For example Apple.  With Chinese supply chain problems, Apple is LIKELY to decline in value in coming days.  It would be a good stock to consider shorting.  Along with WYNN - the casinos.

If you sell short, however, and the stock goes up, you still have to deliver it REGARDLESS of what it costs you to buy.  

**OK TO SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH!**

**What are put options?**  *A* ***put option*** *is a contract giving the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell, or sell short, a specified amount of an underlying security at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame. The pre-determined price the* ***put option*** *buyer can sell at is called the strike price*

Continue reading here:

Shorts are primarily for professional investors. You can lose more money than you started with, face margin calls (Send us more cash or lose your initial investment too!) Buying puts isn't too risky, but ""writing"" or selling them --- Danger Will Robinson!

Leave short-selling Apple and Amazon, and writing puts to big investors with deep pockets. *Always remember, the market can remain irrational longer than your wallet is deep!*

D) **Negative index funds** are one way for SMALL investors to take a position ""betting"" that the overall market will go down. You can POTENTIALLY only lose your initial investment, and not a penny more.

Let me tell you about a couple of index funds that GO UP when the S&P goes down.  Like SDS

SDS portfolio consists of short positions on stocks, and put options on stocks and other derivatives.  (I don't know it's exact content, you can download a prospectus)

An index fund trades like a stock. You can only (potentially) lose your initial investment.   They buy the risky shorts, sell calls, derivatives, .... not you.

You buy ""SDS"" or a similar fund at a lower price and hope it goes up. AS IF it were a stock. My personal investment in the SDS fund has gone from $25/share to $29 a share as the market has crashed.

Chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/mV6hC09](https://imgur.com/gallery/mV6hC09)

When the S&P goes down, ""SDS"" goes up. Likewise if the S&P goes up, ""SDS"" will go down. FAST. It's leveraged, approximately 2:1. You win big or lose big.

2:1 not enough leverage for you?  They have one that's 3:1.  Make money fast or lose it fast.

A lot of brokers consider funds like SDS strictly short-term investments.  Personally I believe the market is going to be headed down for a long time so I'm disregarding their advice.  In the comments below you can get some idea WHY they feel the way they do - issues like ""slippage"" which is the gradual loss of principle.   

**An investment in SDS or similar should only make up on a part of a BALANCED portfolio.** In a bear market that might also bonds, physical gold or a GOLD index fund, cash, plus any biostocks, vaccine companies, web conferencing stocks (ZM, INST)  you think might buck the market.  Netflix & Clorox, lol!

Are index funds without their own problems?  Of course not!

Honestly I did not FULLY understand all of these problems when I originally wrote this article, but if you read through the comments, another Redditor has done a GREAT job of clarifying such things as ""beta decay.""  Market swings --- yo-yo'ing --- may also eat into the value of your investment, and we're certainly seeing a lot of those!

(A truly professional investor might use a ""straddle"" strategy to make money on violent market swings.  This is beyond MY pay grade...) 

*You can (and should) download a prospectus on any investment you intend to make and AT LEAST* ***try*** *and read and understand it.*

[https://www.proshares.com/funds/prospectus.html?ticker=SDS](https://www.proshares.com/funds/prospectus.html?ticker=SDS)

*FWIW, SDS is one of SEVERAL funds offered by Proshares that tracks inversely with different markets Their funds offer differing amounts of ""leverage,"" the market they track, etc.*

I was at one time a licensed broker. I am not now. Use your own judgement.  **Don't do anything just because a stranger on the internet tells you to, ok**? I am simply trying to inform casual investors that there IS a way to earn money in a declining market BESIDES ""risky""short selling.

**Most important:**  Do not ever make ANY investments you do not personally understand!!!  Keep reading and researching until you are COMFORTABLE with any investment ""vehicle"" you intend to buy or sell. Or find a broker you trust.  (lol...)

**About brokers:**  If they know so dang much, why don't they invest their own money and get rich instead of dialing the phone all day begging YOU to let them manage YOUR money.  Being a broker is a job, nothing more.  They live on commissions by convincing you to buy and sell often.  Their best interests and yours MAY OR MAY NOT OVERLAP.

*Of course it's all peaches and creams when the market goes up for 11 straight years.  Now is the time when it gets sticky...*

*There's gonna be a lot of bad news in the coming days, due to the pandemic.*  I personally can watch the market headed down knowing its decline is putting a few extra bucks into my account. *Hopefully I'll be alive to spend it*.

**TL;DR:** An investment in a specialized ""negative"" index fund like SDS can make you money when stock prices go down (S&P index.)  It's ""safer"" than shorting stocks or options trading, the traditional methods of making money in a bear market.  Leave those to the pros!",2020-03-05 13:21:10

Gap Ups: DRAD, JNUG/NUGT, NNVC, NVAX, TVIX

Possible Day 2 Runners: TDOC, ZM, INO, DDOG

The market is gapping down pretty big which usually makes for a tough trading day. With that being said, there are plenty of stocks gapping today and most are gapping with the market. Had I included them all, this list would be ridiculously large so I picked what I thought were the best. Many times stocks will bounce at the open on a large gap like today but due to the extreme nature of the move, and also the SPY not holding the 200 DMA yesterday, we could see some continued selling pressure.

Most airline stocks are extremely oversold and very extended so I didn't add them to my list. Yesterday I mentioned if the market tanked that I would long the TVIX, you can see today why I made that statement yesterday and the TVIX trade worked. However today is a new day. I will be very patient today, and wait for patterns. Days like today it's easy to get chopped up. For now temporary support on the SPY at 285, next after that is the 282 - 280 area.

38,Remote schooling applications,"Universities across the United States and the rest of the world are preparing to make the shift to online classes in response to the spread of COVID-19, especially following spring break. Some colleges, off the top of my head, like Fordham and Hofstra have already made the shift temporarily, and it’s entirely possible that these remote schooling platforms will be used indefinitely until the epidemic is resolved. 

Zoom Video Communications (ZM) is one company I’ve been eyeballing due it’s capability for hosting online lectures as well as its cross platform file sharing.

41,Why $ZM is a horrible Investment,"Hey guys, 

&#x200B;

I know a ton of you guys are looking at $ZM because colleges are cancelling classes and people are working from home. So, for good reason I can see why Zoom is going up but I would like to provide some evidence for investors speculating on earnings growth for this company to think again. Most companies offering these services are offering free trials during the coronavirus cases or just offer free services in general. Which, will not help Zoom earn more money. Moreover, Zoom has a free service and I am positive that all students will be using the free version over the paid version. The company is already highly overpriced and I believe it is upon pure speculation and idiots buying a panacea instead of pure fundamentals and reality.

42,Companies that with long term tailwinds due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus),"I think the Coronavirus is a huge catalyst to speed up the adoption rates of stuff like remote work, remote schooling, e-commerce, etc.

I'[m looking for suggestions and opinions on companies that operate in these sectors that people think will receive long term tailwinds due to Coronavirus.

I think there are some obvious ones like TDOC and ZM, which have already benefited. I think e-commerce and payment companies like AMZN, V and MA are also some more obvious choices, but I think society was already trending quickly into that direction before the virus and this expectation has already been built into the price of those stocks for some time now.

43,What stocks are you looking at now that the market is down big?,"Some stocks are really undervalued like Xerox, Big Lots, BJs restaurants, Aflac, brkb, crox, genworth financial, gnc, the gap, hanes brands, etc. Some of these stocks have p/es and prices under 5 which is rediculous. However, a lot of these weren't good names for instance the only really good stocks of the companies above are Brk and maybe aflac. However, with the market the way it is would it be better to buy companies that are almost at 0, or to still focus on good names that may still be slightly overvalued but have come down a lot. For example, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Lululemon, Adobe, cloud stocks etc. A lot of these still have rediculous P/E ratios and high prices compared to the stocks listed in the undervalued group, but even these stocks have come down greatly almost 40% or so in past month. So would investing in companies in the first group like Big Lots that were underperformers even before the coronavirus, but are now extremely cheap P.E. around 3 to 10, or would the second group of companies ex: Visa/Apple that had higher growth rates before coronavirus but have dropped to P.E.s that are around 20 to 40 be better?

49,Zoom (ZM) stock and thoughts on working from home for the foreseeable future,"The main premise here is that education is moving online.  Zoom (ZM) seems to be the leader in video conferencing.  Of course you have software the likes of YouTube streaming, Facebook Live, What'sApp, Instagram TV, and others.  But these products seem different in that they're mostly built around a global-reach model in that the content creators are trying to get as many people to watch as they can.  

Where I see Zoom being different is in their much more local model.  If you're a millennial, you'll remember chat rooms.  I see Zoom becoming like AOL Instant Messenger, but with videos - private chats.  We don't talk about what happened to AOL in the email race but my point is that as a teacher that was just required to set up my Zoom account for next week's teaching load, I only foresee more and more schools, businesses, and companies using their services.  It's up over $10/share over the last 5 days...

My final hot take: barring a complete disruption to internet services, Zoom and it's competitors are likely to see growth over the next year.

* **Level 2:** A drop of 13% triggers a 15-minute halt. Trading is not halted if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m. ET.
* **Level 3:** A drop of 20% triggers a halt for the rest of the trading day, and trading resumes the following day.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 24th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-24-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures hit their 5% “limit up” levels Tuesday as top Senate and White House officials neared a $2 trillion deal to rescue the economy from the coronavirus crisis. The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve’s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday’s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.

*****

> * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats’ $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. “I’m not looking at months,” the president said.

*****

> * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.

*****

> * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.

*****

> * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday’s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month’s record highs.

*****

> * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to “stabilize key national industries,” according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

*****

> * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.

*****

> * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is “very special” to him. The president added, “I’m not sure that’s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.” He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be “based on hard facts and data” and will be “grounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.”

*****

> * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy’s more than 69,100 cases are second only China’s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy’s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles’ household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

*****

> * Target, one of the retailers that’s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it’s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.

(Bloomberg) -- Trading in Zoom Technologies Inc. (ticker: ZOOM) was suspended by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday through April 8 after the stock climbed in recent weeks amid confusion with Zoom Video Communications Inc. (ticker: ZM), the popular virtual-meeting company.

>The similar names had caused confusion, leading some investors to purchase shares in the wrong company, while San Jose, California-based Zoom Video has been attracting users during the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of the now-halted Zoom Technologies more than tripled over the past five weeks, while Zoom Video rose more than 30% during the same period.

Zoom is an OTC ""communication parts"" company run out of Bejing with a market cap of about $87M. Previously in ZOOM's history the CFO was force to resign after the companies CEO took all of the money from the company.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday halted trading in the shares of Zoom Technologies (ticker symbol: ZOOM), citing “concerns about investors confusing this issuer with a similarly named Nasdaq-listed issuer” during the coronavirus pandemic. That other issuer is Zoom Video Communications (ticker symbol: ZM), whose stock price has, well, zoomed in recent days as droves of workers, confined to their homes to reduce the spread of COVID-19, have turned to its remote meeting services.

Meanwhile, Zoom Technologies, a so-called penny stock traded over the counter, had risen more than 240% over the same time frame before the SEC suspended it. At its high at the end of last week, the “ZOOM” stock had increased nearly sevenfold—from around $3 a share to more than $20—in the span of a month. That’s in spite of the fact that Zoom Technologies, according to the SEC, has not made “any public disclosure” whatsoever—including reporting on its finances or “its operations, if any”—since 2015. The company most recently reported that it was headquartered in Beijing.",2020-03-26 19:43:20

\- “Zoom has added 3.5x more MAUs YTD \[year to date\] than the same period of 2019 (2.22 vs. 0.64 million), so even with half the normal paid user conversion rate, this would still yield 74% y/y growth in paid user adds YTD,” they wrote. '

\- The company added 2.22 million monthly active users so far in 2020, while in 2019 it added 1.99 million.

\-Is no big news that corona is causing a huge spike in Zoom user base. However this report was from March 4, quite early compared to the relative widespread chaos we see now. March 10-15 was when North America started going on lockdown.

\-One religious group, The Jehovah Witnesses(my parents sadly) have stopped there church gatherings. The are going to be holding the church meetings(3 times a week) from video application, you guess it, Zoom. 

\-That is 1.2 million JW in USA, another 250k in Canada, all connecting with the Zoom app, 3 times a week starting like last week or this week. I don't even count other countries, who are also advised to follow the same procedure. 

\-April Is the Memorial of Jesus, the JW most attended ceremony. Last year 2.5 million attended alone in the USA. This year it's the first year ever to be held from individuals homes, all tied together using the Zoom application. On Wed April 8, Zoom app will have 2.5+ JW's alone,  just after sundown. 

\-They will be using the app till this shitstorm is over

\-March 4 Stock ticks at $116, goes to $125 the next day or earnings report. Consensus was -0.01, actual was 0.05 EPS. Again, this report ends fiscal JAN 2020.

\-March 6 onward stock heads south with rest of market, towards $110

\-Then Papa announces free money for the world, fire up the printers, and the ticker booms to $160, drops down to $135 the next day.

Well what does all that mean? i dont have the slightest fucking clue. I just watch the lines go up and down and tune in for the first class stories, Yolo retards and the gay babies but i thought maybe someone else on here could make sense of tis all?

If i was i betting man and didnt think the world was going to collapse in a few months, I would go hard long on this fucker. If this bitch can rally to $160 from fake money, Just imagine what actual real money will do? 

Zacks has it at #3. Most condenses are flat EPS, which is straight bipolar. They beat last report by 0.06 a share. This report in June will be up until like april-may. Will hit .10 a share. Send that ticker into the 2 hundos.

Estimated next report dates is June 4, 2020. Going time for expiration. I mean that is if the whole fucking market does explode.

How can that be possible? We all have very different opinions and expectations about where we are or where we are going. 

This is specially true in these times of extreme uncertainty...

You can’t know if 2 trillion dollars and unlimited QE is “priced in” because no one knows what the fuck that can do to the economy. We only guess.

You can’t “price in” reports of 3m new jobless people in a week because nobody knows what that will mean after the virus is over. We just guess...

We are just making predictions and we are really bad at doing that. 

Who cares what’s the “wisdom of the crowd” in this uncertain environment?
An aggregate of bad predictions doesn’t magically make a better prediction.

Hi All,

We have the potential for a ""Follow Through Day"" this week, which is a gain in one of the major indexes of over 1% with volume greater than the previous trading session. This must happen on the 4th day or later of a rally to be eligible. This is a CANSLIM strategy to get you in as close to a potential bottom while minimizing risk.

After a Follow through day you want to slowly scale in to market leaders, stocks showing excellent technical price performance relative to the indexes. At this point any stocks over their 30 and 50 day moving averages and near their prior highs are showing considerable relative strength. This price action suggest that institutions are keeping their large positions in them and potentially buying more.

Here is my focus list for the upcoming trading week:

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open Tuesday, the final day of the turbulent first quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3% on Monday — up over 20% from its coronavirus sell-off low hit on March 23 but still off 24.5% from last month’s record high. The 10-year Treasury yield moved higher early Tuesday but remained around 0.7%. U.S. oil prices were bouncing more than 5% early Tuesday after falling below $20 per barrel to an 18-year low and finishing the New York session just above that level Monday. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in phone call Monday, agreed to talks to stabilize energy markets. China’s official purchasing managers’ index for March showed an expansion instead of an expected contraction. However, Chinese officials warned against reading too much into the numbers because February’s outbreak halt was so severe.

*****

> * Wall Street closes the books Tuesday on the worst month since the financial crisis, when the Dow sank 14% in October 2008, and the worst quarter since Q4 1987, a three-month period that included the October “Black Monday” stock market crash. The fourth quarter in 1987 saw the Dow plunge 25.3%. This year, heading into the final trading day in March, the Dow was losing more than 12% for the month and nearly 22% for the first quarter as the coronavirus crisis bought the U.S. economy to a virtual halt. The S&P 500 was faring marginally better than the Dow, off 11% in March, the worst since a nearly 17% drop in October 2008.

The arrival of the Comfort attracted crowds, with many seeing the ship as a symbol of hope. But the onlookers also raised questions around social distancing.The Comfort’s mission was to help take the strain off New York hospitals, which have been overwhelmed by coronavirus cases. Temporary hospitals have been set up in New York’s Javits Convention Center and in Central Park. The Comfort’s sister ship, the USNS Mercy, has been serving noncoronavirus cases in Los Angeles since Sunday.

> * Amazon has fired a New York warehouse worker who organized a strike to demand what he sees as the greater need for coronavirus protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant at the fulfillment center known as JFK8 on the city’s Staten Island, told CNBC on Monday he was fired to keep him quiet. Amazon said Smalls was fired after he received “multiple warnings” for violating social distancing guidelines and refusing to remain quarantined after coming into close contact with an associate who tested positive for the virus. The organizers said at least 50 people joined Monday’s walkout. Amazon said that number was more like 15. The JKF8 facility employs about 4,500 people.

78,"A Guide on what to look for in ""Pennystocks"" before they run","&#x200B;

This guide will be short, sweet, and to the point.

First off you have to realize that ""PennyStocks"" or most stocks that are under a few dollars are mostly Pump n Dumps. You will once in awhile find one that is a legit investment on the long term side, but it's RARE.

**Now, What makes a PennyStock ""Magically"" Jump in Price ?**

* News (CT Data, Pandemics(Coronavirus being the newest one))
* A Catalyst (Upcoming clinical Trial Data, Upcoming Events)
* Pump Rooms (Rooms giving false hope of a stock going up, can cause it to go up, who knew, lol)
* Idiots (An example being people thinking the Stock ""ZOOM"" was ""ZM"", Jumped 60$ in a day)

With information I posted in the other thread, you're able to handle the first two bullet points with ease. Now you can either wait for news to come to you, or you can search the globe for what's going on and take advantage of it.

As an example, When COVID-19 hit the world, most of the experienced traders knew what to do. For the ones that play in Large caps like myself, We shorted Companies that would be hit the hardest like Air Travel, Cruises, Resorts, Etc. Now for people in Pennystocks, they knew to keep an eye on Cheap companies that were in the Biotech Field as well as Oil companies that would be affected. You'll notice that once news came out of a possible ""cure"" or ""treatment"" , the stocks jumped up a lot that day.

Keep an eye on what important people say around the world. When Trump talked about Ventilators and how bad we needed them in America, people started to look for pennystocks in that field. Same went for companies that produced masks(Even though 3M has the main contract) and other products that countries were saying they were in need of.

**Now, What if you're a Lazy fuck and only want to concentrate on the charts and not deal with deals ?**

Easy Solution... Watch Volume. This applies to all stocks and I'll show you what I mean.

[https://imgur.com/pDCIicA](https://imgur.com/pDCIicA)

This is a 1YR/1DY chart for ZN and the Blue bars indicate volume.  Notice how Volume is sparse to low, but then once it reaches 0.12, is when Volume starts to pick up.

[https://imgur.com/EiS72iR](https://imgur.com/EiS72iR)

Here's BYND on the same time frame and notice how volume is low and when it starts to pick up more than the average, it ended up ""running""

[https://imgur.com/MKUos3H](https://imgur.com/MKUos3H)

FCEL... As you can see, it can be a good sign to at least Keep an eye on it.

Now following Volume is not 100%, but it's a damn good indicator that something is going on if Volume is suddenly increasing higher and higher. Could be people are loading up for an event or expecting some form of news of coming out.

**Follow others blindly ?**

This Method I do not recommend (Even if some of the mods of this subreddit do it) . However! Keep a watch on what the most popular people on places like Stocktwits and Twitter are talking about. The reality of most of those ""Traders"" is that they are able to get a lot of followers to buy into a stock(either intentional or on accident) and have it start to pump.

Now don't be a sheep and follow , but be a wolf and take advantage of the sheep that do.

**PLEASE REMEMBER!**

Pennystocks are (mostly)meant to be played as Swings(Get in before the pump) or Day Trades. If you get into a Pennystock on a day it's running and you're green as fuck with gains, then PLEASE either scale out some or take profits. It can dump easily in the wee hours of the morning while you're sleeping if you hold overnight and that is not a good thing.

**Good luck to everyone and sorry for the shitty writing, running on no sleep.**",2020-03-31 21:37:38

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday’s open ahead of what’s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.

*****

> * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week’s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month — before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.

*****

> * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening’s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is “on track” with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the “ultimate game changer” in the fight to control the pandemic.

*****

> * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a “very, very painful two weeks,” estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 — nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total. But it has the most deaths, 13,155.

*****

> * Boeing — whose stock has been slammed by the coronavirus economic halt and last year’s grounding of its 737 Max fleet — is reportedly set to start offering early retirement and buyout packages to workers. Several media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, said that an internal announcement is expected as soon as Thursday. Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take “a few years” for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)

*****

> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday’s open ahead of what’s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.

*****

> * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week’s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month — before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.

*****

> * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening’s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is “on track” with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the “ultimate game changer” in the fight to control the pandemic.

*****

> * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a “very, very painful two weeks,” estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 — nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total. But it has the most deaths, 13,155.

*****

> * Boeing — whose stock has been slammed by the coronavirus economic halt and last year’s grounding of its 737 Max fleet — is reportedly set to start offering early retirement and buyout packages to workers. Several media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, said that an internal announcement is expected as soon as Thursday. Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take “a few years” for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.

Gap Ups: BMRA, BP, CODX, IO, MRNA, NUGT/JNUG, 

Gap Downs: LK, NVTA, SHOP, ZM

Possible day 2 plays: APT, KMX

&#x200B;

The market is opening flat which isn't necessarily a bad thing and usually this tends to happen a couple weeks before earnings while things slow down. AA reports earnings on April 15 to kick off earnings season so although it may be slow for while here while the market digests all this news regarding viruses and stimulus packages, the action will pick up again in the following weeks to come.I usually don't trade stocks under $5 but lately thats what has been gapping so I am forced to put them on the list.

Right now we will have to see if the SPY continues to decline to the previous pivot level from 2018 at 234 or if it tests the recent low at 217. Maybe it doesn't test them and moves higher, no one knows at this point. Until we see some direction, patience will be your friend. Only take good setups with defined risk/reward.

Gap Ups: BMRA, BP, CODX, IO, MRNA, NUGT/JNUG, 

Gap Downs: LK, NVTA, SHOP, ZM

Possible day 2 plays: APT, KMX

&#x200B;

The market is opening flat which isn't necessarily a bad thing and usually this tends to happen a couple weeks before earnings while things slow down. AA reports earnings on April 15 to kick off earnings season so although it may be slow for while here while the market digests all this news regarding viruses and stimulus packages, the action will pick up again in the following weeks to come.I usually don't trade stocks under $5 but lately thats what has been gapping so I am forced to put them on the list.

Right now we will have to see if the SPY continues to decline to the previous pivot level from 2018 at 234 or if it tests the recent low at 217. Maybe it doesn't test them and moves higher, no one knows at this point. Until we see some direction, patience will be your friend. Only take good setups with defined risk/reward. If you are new, this market will be a bit choppy so trade smaller than usual.",2020-04-02 08:48:52
86,$ZM should share holders be concern with Zoom security breach?,"$ZM They've been a lot of negatives news lately on behalf of security breach to Zoom video conferences...

Is this something to be concern?",2020-04-02 21:12:53
87,Puts on everything except for ZM. Calls on ZM.,"They're getting so much press. I don't care if most of it is negative. A month ago most ppl didn't know what zoom was and now everyone knows. And they're gonna absolutely crush earnings. And from experience, they actually have a good product. It's easily the best conferencing platform there is.

No positions in it... yet.",2020-04-04 20:42:34
88,Question about Zoom investment. Some DD,"The CFO of Zoom (ZM) appears to get a 11,067 shares of stock per month and sells them immediately, leaving her/him with 0 shares in the company.

10/18/19 Kelly Steckelberg CFO Sell 11,067 $65.60 TOTAL: $725,995.20 -- Remaining: 0

11/18/19 Kelly Steckelberg CFO Sell 11,067 $69.90 TOTAL: $773,583.30 -- Remaining: 11,067

\[Not sure how 11/18 is possible unless she got double shares that month\]

12/18/19 Kelly Steckelberg CFO Sell 11,067 $67.23 TOTAL: $744,034.41 -- Remaining: 0

1/21/20 Kelly Steckelberg CFO Sell 11,067 $76.05 TOTAL: $841,645.35 -- Remaining: 0

2/19/20 Kelly Steckelberg CFO Sell 11,067 $102.66 TOTAL: $1,136,138.22 -- Remaining 0

3/19/20 Kelly Steckelberg CFO Sell 11,067 $126.58 TOTAL:$1,400,860.86 -- Remaining 0

Source:  [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ZM/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ZM/insider-trades/) 

So the CFO has been selling 100% of her stock as soon as she apparently gets a refresh on her options. This has occurred since before the corona virus despite the price increasing each month (except one time since 10/19). This doesn't show much faith in the company (Or she just needs a couple new lambos each month). Is this normal behavior? Is it also normal for a CFO to make on average \~1mil per month on stock options? Also the CEO has sold over 50% of her stock options in the past month.

I just flipped my long in zoom from long to short, and I'm slightly in the red, so I'm obviously looking to confirm my bias. But with all the privacy/security worries related to China recently, and the 160% increase in stock price within 16 weeks, I don't want to cut my losses yet.

TL:DR: Is it normal for CFO's to get 1mil in stock options per month and sell them immediately like the CFO of Zoom does?

89,Will Zoom (ZM) Last?,"So recently Zoom has been hit with a plague of bad news ranging from security issues in their platform to NYC schools banning teachers from using this program to facilitate teaching. My wife is a teacher in the Dallas area and they are currently contemplating the same decision NYC has made.

Do you think these hiccups will be short term issues or affect the company long term also?",2020-04-05 13:38:50

Tesla and the government already banned it. Schools in NY are starting to ban it as well.

Edit: premiums are already high so just short it instead",2020-04-05 15:24:29
91,Big Shorts Looming?,"Looking at some giant short opportunities and these might be surprising to people:

WMT...Walmart still near 52 week highs and foot traffic just starting to slow now..soon it will be the sound of silence. $119 to <$80

No money, no problem? No money, big problem for WMT.

KR..Kroger also near 52 week highs, even all time highs. $32 to <$20. Everyone is stocked up, dead broke and Kroger is still hiring like a madman. Gearing up supply chains, moving tons into retail space to rot on the shelves. 

ZM...what's not to short about this? There will be a dozen+ knock offs soon. Share price is an insult to one's intelligence. $127 to <$60

TLSA..the mother of all shorts! $475/share when in a few short months most wont be able to afford a beater Hyundai. This has to be the single most absurd valuation since the [dot.com](https://dot.com) bubble. $475 to <$40, I might even go lower. 

PTON...hahahahahahhaha. This is incredible. Hordes of millennials that wont be able to make rent/mortgage peddling on overpriced stationary bikes getting in shape for dates they will never go on because they are broke, can't pay back their student loans and even with home prices about to crash, will never a own a home until they are 40+. And you will still all be fat and out of shape because cycling for 30 minutes at home isnt going to make up for the 4000 calories of snacks you eat all day! PTON $28 to <$18

Anyone have other good shorts still with legs?",2020-04-05 16:07:32
92,Just received an email about ZM,School system just sent out an email about how they were going to use Zoom for this garbage put together on a whim computer schooling but are now advised not to by the school system. Now this is for elementary grades that had absolutely nothing set up in the event of a shut down. Had no inkling to even try to set something up ahead of time. We are in WY so anything to deal with computers is not the forte for 95% of the population in this state so for them sending out an email about ZM seems very crazy to me and some puts on Monday are looking good I'll be going for 100p Monday morning,2020-04-05 17:49:41
93,ZM information,"I just received this email from my son's school:

Good afternoon,

Here we go.  Again bear with us in all of this.  We were hoping to set up some Zoom times daily to have students check in and ask questions or just visit.  However, we are being advised to not use Zoom.  We are looking into some other ways to chat with the students and will hopefully get those up and running to be shared with you soon.

Once again, we are all new to this teachers, parents, students.  We will get through this together. I will be available through Remind and email if you have any questions or need help with anything.

His school did not have anything for a backup if something went wrong we are in WY so anything dealing with computers in this state isn't a strong suite around here for most. So for them to say not to use it is quite a surprise I for one will be looking to short ZM Monday",2020-04-05 18:07:51

The SPY is gapping up over 4% at the time I am writing this. Gap days are usually harder to trade. Most large gaps in the market get sold off at open but occasionally they do hold so be aware and stay patient.  As of right now the SPY is holding this temporary support and trying to form a ""W"" pattern but the weekly 200 moving average is still overhead and that's where it got rejected last week. Day to day basis right now until we get out of this range. If market breaks back below last weeks low most likely we will see a retest of the lows, if it breaks above the weekly 200 ma we could see some continuation to the upside as earnings season starts in 2 weeks. Only time will tell.  Almost no stocks moving with individual catalyst.

*****

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 800-point gain at Monday’s open as improved coronavirus data in Europe offered hope for the United States. Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. “We have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,” Dimon wrote.

*****

> * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were “very close” to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose “very substantial” tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he’ll need to do so.

*****

> * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world — in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries — Italy, Spain and Germany — combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe’s hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain’s 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.

*****

> * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week. Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cook also said Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, April 6th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday.html)

*****

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 800-point gain at Monday’s open as improved coronavirus data in Europe offered hope for the United States. Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. “We have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,” Dimon wrote.

*****

> * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were “very close” to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose “very substantial” tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he’ll need to do so.

*****

> * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world — in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries — Italy, Spain and Germany — combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe’s hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain’s 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.

*****

> * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week. Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cook also said Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.

Zoom's daily users ballooned to more than 200 million in March, as coronavirus-induced shutdowns forced employees to work from home and schools switched to the company's free app for conducting and co-ordinating online classes.

However, the company is facing a backlash from users worried about the lack of end-to-end encryption of meeting sessions and ""Zoom-bombing,"" where uninvited guests crash meetings.""

""The security aspects of Zoom have not been assessed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre), and it has not been approved for any government discussions that require secure communications,"" Ryan Foreman, a spokesperson for the Communications Security Establishment, Canada's electronic surveillance agency, said last week.

I'm paying some attention to this, because a lot of people are buying middling companies at great prices, but ignoring excellent companies at good prices.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)

*****

> * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday’s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank’s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street’s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday’s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.

*****

> * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It’s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.

*****

> * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won’t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on “Squawk Box,” the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world’s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That’s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state’s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday’s news conference the outbreak could “stabilize” within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.

*****

> * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That’s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.

110,A Diamond in the Rough - Debated Welcome!,"Many investors hunting for multi-baggers have their eyes set on companies that are 1) aligned with popular narrative and 2) growing revenue at a remarkable clip, reasoning that if revenue growth continues then the equity value will participate in a non-linear manner. Think $ZM or $TSLA. $ZM's been the beneficiary of the work from home narrative, while $TSLA's been on the front-line of pushing back against climate change in a capitalistic way. I won't get into whether I think either's a good investment in this thread, but they're both *stories* that investors have latched onto for a big potential payday.

The company I'm bullish on (and, disclosure, am long) is $HNRG, Hallador Energy, perhaps the antithesis of these two prior stocks as far as investing approach goes. While the $ZM thesis relies on the company being able to parlay the huge amount of new (unpaid) user-ship into cash flow, $HNRG is reliably free cash flow positive. While $TSLA vehicles run exclusively on electricity, $HNRG creates the electricity that $TSLA vehicles utilize, and yet you'd never find $HNRG in an ESG index.

Hallador is a miner of steam coal, coal that's burned by utilities to produce electricity. The obvious point is that coal usage is diminishing in the US. That's true, and has been true for decades, but coal will continue to play a large part in utilities' fuel-mix as renewables take up larger share; because it's a base-load fuel, coal has been depended on to power electrical grids when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Similarly, there's an ease of storage: you can simply stack it on-site and wait for a rainy day.

Coal companies have been failing left and right. There are ugly profiles of Murray / Foresight ($FELP) in the WSJ ([It's real ugly out there.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/murray-energy-pushed-to-brink-of-liquidation-11585661530) ). Stock charts for coal companies -- e.g., Peabody ($BTU), Contura ($CTRA), Alliance ($ARLP), Arch ($ARCH) -- are depressing. $HNRG's stock chart is no less bleak, down >60% year-to-date, and an unspeakable amount from its peak.

&#x200B;

[$HNRG over five years...Not pretty](https://preview.redd.it/9bcbxg3738s41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=271878d4b41dca92c34a9302b0dd6f9e1be0712d)

And yet, $HNRG's value proposition is different than these much larger companies. Peabody ($BTU) proudly proclaims that it's the largest private-sector coal company in the world, and that's precisely its problem. In a secularly declining industry, you don't want a dominant position. Hallador, by contrast, sells \~70% of its production inside the state of Indiana, a dependable friend of the fuel source as many utilities there rely heavily on coal-burning plants and many voters live in towns kept alive by the mining industry.

Lack of popularity alone isn't killing the coal share prices, though. The existential problem is debt. When these large companies were selling at higher volumes and higher prices, the debtloads looked responsible. But at this moment of economic contraction and of coal oversupply, the debt is beginning to look crushing. These large companies rely on the so-called ""spot market,"" selling their tons as they're producing them at the prevailing rate. More than 50% of sales in a given year for most large producers come from the spot market, as opposed to having pre-arranged sales agreements in place.

That's where Hallador is different. They have 100% of this upcoming year's projected sales already sold and at fixed prices. Hallador has sold 6.7M tons at $40/ton. Similarly, they have \~80% of next year's sales (2021) already sold at that same price, and \~75% of 2022 done at an even higher price. The reason this is so essential is that the current ""spot"" price of IL basin coal (the type they produce) is \~$33. Selling at that price-point would push a company like Hallador to bankruptcy in short, but they're mostly pre-sold for three years while their competitors are heading for liquidation.

&#x200B;

[From 10-K... 85&#37; of sales through 2022](https://preview.redd.it/zyvrh3x738s41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54c3ea60ca50a8920c05e9545edd22322a3a7d14)

Arguably, there is no institutional investor interest in the name these days. With it being a coal company, not many endowments would want to bother with it for ESG reasons. It's also a very small cap stock now, which keeps large investors away; bear in mind, its enterprise value approached $1bn at one moment within the last ten years, and yet they produced the most coal ever in 2019. The disconnect between investor interest and business prospects is stark. Let's look at some numbers.

The company did \~$70M of EBITDA in 2019, and its enterprise value as of Friday was charitably \~$200M. For pricing, that's less than 3x last 12 month's EBITDA. Next year, they expect to do in the neighborhood of $65M of EBITDA. (By the way, the reason you should use EBITDA as opposed to an accounting-earnings denominator metric like P/E is because of the DD&A. You're probably familiar with depreciation and amortization, but what's the other D? That's depletion, and it makes intuitive sense why you'd add that back. If you're a coal company, you hold the land/minerals on your balance sheet as an asset. As you're digging the asset out of the ground, you're reducing your assets, which allows you reduce your taxes by charging that depletion as a loss of value, but you keep the cash; you're monetizing your in-the-ground assets. In 2019, you'll also see that they wrote down the value of a mine that they closed because it wasn't profitable enough to keep operating in this environment.)

&#x200B;

[From Hallador's press release](https://preview.redd.it/r4j4jyq838s41.png?width=281&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4192c2ba69deb44b673836f2f5ba4671fea41354)

Here's their break-down of free cash flow:

&#x200B;

[From same 2020 press release](https://preview.redd.it/bu9lxek938s41.png?width=315&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=49f391433dab4587712721afa58f73e1271c8f82)

&#x200B;

What's amazing here is that the market cap has dwindled to be just under $30M as of Friday's close. And so you're able to buy this at about 100% free cash flow yield (FCF was \~$30M for 2019). Hallador has guided (see transcript: [Seeking Alpha transcript 4Q19](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4331060-hallador-energy-company-hnrg-ceo-brent-bilsland-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) ) that they aim to pay down $35M of debt in 2020. For easy math, lets say the (very depressed) enterprise value of this company is $200M: $170M of debt and $30M equity. Suppose Hallador executes as they say, and the debt goes to $135M. That means the equity would've grown to $65M, over a 100% return from the $30M.

To be clear, the rational risk here is that the company goes bankrupt. They have $180M of gross debt, and their covenants say that the debt has to be no more than 2.75x adjusted EBITDA by year-end 2020. Lets say they do $60M of adj EBITDA this year (less than last year, despite closing the lower margin mine). The maximum debt debt they could have is $165M. So it could be tight. But Hallador (same transcript as above) guided that they aim to generate $50M of free cash flow this year: through 1) the operating business, 2) the reduced capital expenditures from closing the higher cost mine and literally driving the equipment down to their better-producing mines, and 3) from selling inventory they'd built up ahead of the coming shipping seasons. \[Also, for those focused on COVID, $HNRG is an essential business in Indiana; ventilators run on electricity.\] Additionally, they have a \~$5M dividend they could elect not to pay and use that to reduce debt if necessary.

In summary, I ask a question. People like YOLO call options, right? Aren't buying call options a pretty awesome deal? Yes and no. Yes because it's non-recourse leverage, meaning you can only lose the premium (and they can't come after your house), and you can make an unlimited amount of money. BUT actual call options have to overcome implied volatility and overcome timing risks (both time decay of option itself and having a definite expiry date). At worst, the investment proposition for buying Hallador is a call option. Your max loss is the premium - however much you put in - in the event they go bankrupt. But your maximum gain is uncapped on this levered company that's been thrown out with the bathwater. Consider the math if they survive this year and get re-rated to 5x EBITDA in two years. If EBITDA's $75M, then that'd be an enterprise value of $375. If they've paid down $60M of debt (30/yr), then that's $120M of debt remaining, implying equity of $255M. (They've traded nearly double this before). On $30M of equity today, that's about an eight-bagger. And instead of having time-decay on the option, to the extent they're paying the dividend, that carries north of 15%/yr at these prices.

I welcome the debate. Thanks for reading.

120,ZM DD - Coming Implosion,"So pre-market chatting with u/Kramnet about Zoom and how it is totally going against all logic sparked this DD.  In the chat, we theorized if roughly 1% of the 200m to 400m new users bought premium, that ZM would skyrocket.  This set me out to see if that would really cause a skyrocket.  For all assumptions, I am going to take a best scenario approach. In march they said that about 200M people are using it (and not all of these can be new).  Plus, the CFO has been saying that most of the uptick in usage is in the free version. However, we will still take everything at best approach:

We'll take the high side - 4,000,000

Cost per month - $15

New Revenue Added - $180M

Previous Q Rev - $188.3M = Q1FY20 Revenue - $368.3M

N/I - holding GP at 81.5% (consistent 2019 & 2018), and then increasing everything else (marketing, G&A, etc.) by only 33% (compared to 100% revenue growth) - $108M Quarterly N/I. Probably way way high as Q4 N/I was $12.2M. (ZM has been doubling revenue annual the past 3 years, to double revenue in a quarter is a aggressive, but possible). If I was really guessing - N/I would be more around $30 -40M.

Shares - Basic - 233.6M / Diluted - 254.3M

EPS for the Q - 0.45 / Annualized PE 175 / PEG Over 6 with a 50% growth even after that. This is astronomical and someday we will wake up and see that nobody wants that.

Positions - 145/155 call credit spreads. one 5/15 100P (bagholding). Will enter 110p 8/20 when we hit $150, or by end of week.",2020-04-14 12:33:28
121,Literal free money on Zoom (ZM) puts...,"I don't know if someone made a post about this already but if they did here's another post yelling at you to get zoom puts. They're about to hit all time highs around $159 which is all revolved around ""everyone is using zoom they will probably go up"" -every fucking boomer on the planet. This shit stock meme stock whatever  you wanna call it is not lasting through our next leg down (last post says it all). Up 321% on the year? Because they make a few extra bucks? Purely off hype just like tesla is except tsla actually makes a valuable product, not some platform with hackers literally data mining and selling children's log in information on the dark web.

Once zoom hits 160 grab your entire portfolio sell your shitty stocks that only gain 1% a day and dump it into ZM 5/22 $100p and watch that become a 10x bagger.

Of course this is pure speculation and zoom will probably come out with a phone or some shit and fuck me and my puts up to -99%... BUT if I am right I can assure a 10x play.

123,The right temperament,"When Warren Buffet talks about investors needing the right temperament I believe he's talking about investors right now who look at great companies like SHOP, AMZN, TDOC, ZM and buy regardless how little margin of safety there is.  It's hard to resist and it seems those stocks just keep going up to infinity.  But the party can't last forever.  These stocks with 20+ price to sales seem ridiculous.  I noticed even AMZN and NFLX had relatively low price to sales until just 3 or so years ago.  It seems valuations for tech companies went out the window about 3 years ago.",2020-04-16 21:01:44

126,Is Tesla the Most Overvalued Stock of 2020?,"I can not fathom how TSLA stock shot up 108.7% since the crash “bottom” on March 18th. TSLA is only down 18% since all time highs on February 19th.

Gas is cheaper than it’s been in a decade, meaning gasoline powered vehicles are more attractive. 

The unemployment rate is almost 20%, which is a number almost completely unimaginable. People can barely make their mortgage and rent payments, let alone spend $100k on a new Model S.

People are staying home due to social distancing, and there are a fraction of as many cars on the road than last year.

How in the world do people think TSLA is a buy right now?

Edit: to the people saying “Tesla isn’t just a car company”, yes that may be true. But 94% of its revenue comes from automotive and services.",2020-04-19 14:04:12
127,The market as a whole seems like it should be a lot lower right now. But which stocks specifically do you guys think are irrationally higher than they should be?,"Airline stocks are down 60-70%, Bank stocks are down 35-50%, cruise lines are down even more. These industries haven't really bounced back with the others for obvious reasons. Other stocks like AMZN, WORK, and ZM are up though, also for fairly obvious reasons. Everything here makes sense and I can see why the investors of each stock have been reacting to the overall market situation the way that they have been for the most part at least if I look deep enough. But I, along with a lot of others, feel like the market is higher than it should be. It seems like we all think the market is overvalued, but its not these stocks (my stocks), its the other ones. So what are some of those other ones that you feel are not accurately priced right now, or ones you feel like need to drop substantially to face reality? Were they also overvalued before the global meltdown in your opinion?

I'm pretty sure TSLA will be mentioned but this one was also weird before the entire COVID-19 meltdown anyways and feel like it's been discussed enough.",2020-04-19 18:52:57
128,Trying to understand wash sales and its driving me crazy,"OK, so a wash sale is basically when you BUY a stock, SELL it for a LOSS, then BUY it back again WITHIN 30 days right? (61 calendar days before and after the sold loss date if you already had the wash sale)

Ex1: Buy ABC for $10, sell ABC for $9 for a $1 loss, then buy back ABC again (all within 30 days) and vice versa on the short side

But I've been reading and researching about wash sales and people have said to not worry about wash sales UNTIL December-January because thats when your wash sale losses can be deferred into the new year. Others say you should try to avoid wash sales all year round.

So since I've started intra-daytrading live this year in January and about 4 months in, I've been recording all of my losing trades on paper with a loss date and keep track of these as ""stocks NOT to trade for at least 31 days"" to avoid them being a wash sale. Well, the problem is now that my main players (aka stocks I trade almost daily such as BA, ROKU, ZM, etc) are on this losers list and my scanner isnt picking up other good stocks to trade sometimes.

So the question is: can I still trade my main key stocks daily even though they'll become wash sales and not worry about them being a wash sale until the end of the year? And then I can apply the rule of not trading them for at least 30 days if they become losses?

I also close out all of my positions everyday if that matters.",2020-04-19 20:59:18

131,Post COVID Companies I am Bullish On,"**Thermal Imaging**

Thermal imaging cameras and sensors will be in high demand. If you look at Chinese airports, malls, and grocery stores, they have thermal scanners installed. If you have a fever, you cannot go in. Most hospitals I know off in the US check their staff for fever prior to working as hospital staff account for 20% of all COVID19 cases and could potentially be super spreaders.

There's no way we can have one person manually doing this. Image cruises, casinos, airports and any high trafficked areas. These are essential in a post covid world. Rumors of Amazon actually purchasing this for Whole Foods.

**Lab Testing**

**Delivery Service**

134,Let's talk about Zoom ($ZM),"I used to be a huge Zoom proponent. It has amazing brand recognition, it's spreading like wild fire, and lately it's looking like it's just being hyped up everywhere you look.

Motley Fool has been acting as though Zoom is basically the next Netflix. ZM is currently trading at about a quarter of the entire value of NFLX.

Let's think about that. ZM, a company with $600 million in revenue (about 3% of which is profits) is a quarter of the valuation as NFLX, a company with $20 Billion in annual revenue (10% of which is profits)

This feels a lot like finance boomers not understanding tech again (reminds me of the .com bubble)

To break that down even further, Netflix is trading at 4x valuation of Zoom with literally 1000x the profit. 

Let's forget NFLX and just look at ZM by itself.

600 annual million revenue. 20 million annual profits. FOURTY BILLION DOLLAR MARKET CAP. During. A. Recession.

I have long and short term ZM puts and they've started making money today and I imagine over the course of the coming months and another earnings we are going to see a HUGE dropoff in value in Zoom.

Zoom blew up because it's a popular name right now but it has a lot of competition. It has very big security issues. It won't have less than 100 forward P/E for decades at this rate. 

https://i.imgur.com/nJfxq20.jpg this is the growth of Zoom quarter-by-quarter in the last year

https://i.imgur.com/z03DBuX.jpg this is the growth of Zoom’s valuation in the past year based on the hype of working remotely. Do you notice how the quarter by quarter growth rate hasn’t even changed from this event?

After $CSCO and $MSFT, the most notable cloud vendors include $ZM, $RNG and $FIVN.

However, as April progressed, this initial COVID-19 driven tailwind appears to now have turned into a headwind, as many customers under financial pressures are beginning to reduce usage or postpone projects. In person sales and deployment have also been curtailed. The verticals seeing the biggest impact (unsurprisingly) are retail, manufacturing, travel and transportation. Growth expectations in the industry is reportedly being revised down by \~5% on average.

Zoom was repeatedly highlighted as the pure play vendor seeing the biggest near term demand increase. Interestingly, the checks also indicate Zoom has thus far seen minimal customer churn despite all the negative publicity related to its security issues.",2020-04-22 13:19:39

Earnings season has officially started, in the near future we should start seeing some more opportunities than usual. As for today, pre market is flat while the SPY tries to make it's way over the 50 day moving average. As far as gappers go, there is a few but not many good ones that I like so I will be patient at open as yesterday was pretty choppy for the first hour or so until the market found direction. If SPY can break and hold over the 50 DMA, we have room to the 200 DMA which is currently at around 300. I feel repetitive saying this but due to the comments and messages I will continue to say it, always have a target and stop calculated Before you take any trades, this is important to eliminate emotions and give you an exit plan in case price moves against you.

138,In-Depth Analysis and Valuation on Zoom Video Communications (ZM),"**\*\*\*If you hate reading then skim through and only look at the bolded//All Analysis conducted on 4/20 closing prices\*\*\***

**Section I: Executive Summary Investment Thesis (Valuation as of 4/20)**

* Zoom provides a ‘video-first’ cloud-native scalable communications platform that changes how people interact through frictionless video, voice, chat, and content sharing
   * It primarily serves enterprises in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, but also caters to individuals as well
* **Zoom’s (ZM) share price (****as of 4/20/2020****) is $148.99**
   * I believe that they are overvalued and should be priced around $70-$85
      * **While the market went down 30%, ZM shares have climbed 17% since the market peak on Feb. 19 (ZM was at $104) and peaked at $164.94 on March 23 (the day the market reached its current low)**
* I think the rise in Zoom shares is unwarranted, regardless of stay at home circumstances surrounding the Coronavirus.
   * **Management noted materially higher usage from free users but saw no significant revenue uplift from the pandemic**. Users have spiked from 10 million in December to 200 million in March, and just recently 300 million.
   * **The company’s funnel is increasing, as so many users are having a trial by fire on Zoom’s video calling application. However, I am skeptical that Zoom will be able to convert enough of these free users within a reasonable time frame to justify the current valuation.**
* **I want to clarify that I see Zoom growing tremendously over the next five years, but the price is way ahead of itself**
   * I attribute the growth to its Y/Y revenue growth being 88.4% over the past year, 118% the year prior, and 149% two years prior.
   * With a SaaS business model, Zoom will enjoy a low CapEx due to third-party hosting (mostly Amazon Web Services) which eliminates the costs of self-managed servers, and as such is positioned against significant depreciation costs
   * I point to the **PEG** (**appropriate for high growth/speculative stocks**) and P/E ratios to expected favorable future earnings, but also an indication that the stock is highly overvalued
      * **NTM** (next twelve months) **PEG is 10x** which means that the stock is **overvalued** when **taking into account both current earnings and the expected growth rate for these earnings in the future**
      * LTM P/E ratio of 1489.9x and a NTM P/E ratio of 346.5x which both indicate the stock is trading high relative to earnings but offers little insight into the company’s EPS growth prospects

**List of Key Drivers**

* **Zoom was actually profitable on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2019**
   * Unlike many young software companies, I expect profitability to continue as SaaS business models generally have consistent costs
* **Strong balance sheet with $0 debt and approximately $850 million in total cash and short term investments**
* **Long runway for growth with continued market penetration through leveraging their cloud-based solution's ease of use and innovative features**
   * Gaining traction with its Zoom Phones VoIP solutions with more than 2,900 customers
   * Pricing tiers are based on a per user per month basis and include Basic (free), Pro ($15), Business ($20), and Enterprise for $20 (more features with a volume discount).
   * Zoom Rooms enables conference rooms with Zoom Meetings functionality and is $49 per room per month.
   * Zoom Conference Room Connector allows organizations using legacy providers (such as Cisco) to join Zoom meetings and is priced at $49 per port per month.
* In its S-1 filing, the company sized the unified communications and collaboration market at $43.1 billion by 2022, with a 3% annual market growth rate and a clear shift toward cloud-based solutions
   * It is clear that cloud-based software is an emerging market within communications that has tremendous growth potential
* **The unprecedented circumstances surrounding academics and work has given Zoom the ability to place its service in the hands of millions of people and the opportunity to retain some of these customers**

**\*\*\*List of Key Risks \*\*\***

* **Strong competition from a variety of technology providers**
   * **Cisco (Webex) and Microsoft (Teams and Skype) dominate the video conferencing market and can bundle a broad array of solutions in response to a competitive threat from Zoom.**
   * **The industry has considerable intellectual property development which exposes Zoom** to **adverse rulings** in patent infringement cases that could force the company to pay **confiscatory license fees** or **abandon technology altogether**
* **Zoom offers a freemium model** and **caters to companies** of all sizes which means **revenue is concentrated among the largest customers.** 
   * **Smaller customers typically have higher churn,** which could be exacerbated in Zoom’s case, where the **number of free users far outpaces the number of paid users**. I believe the nature of the model would dictate a higher churn than fully paid enterprise software models.
   * It remains unclear whether we are witnessing a paradigm shift in the way people work that enables Zoom to convert a substantial proportion of the new free users into paying subscribers or whether these users will simply abandon the service when the current restrictions are lifted
* Although expected to produce revenue growth at the high end of peers, this higher valuation offers less room for missteps and therefore carries greater inherent risks 
   * **Zoom faces several lawsuits surrounding privacy concerns**
   * **Risks of customer data breaches** and service outages especially with **80% of Zoom’s R&D staff is based in China** which poses a significant risk due to trade relations, data sensitivity, and the significant rise of intellectual property and trade secret theft present in China
   * Zoom completed its IPO in April 2019, so it has a **limited operating history as a public company to scrutinize**
   * **At high valuation levels, companies can often become momentum stocks that are punished severely if they do not deliver against expectations, which are regularly higher than consensus**
* Executing across so many different aspects of growth simultaneously in their product portfolio.
   * Zoom Phone (VoIP product) is a more complex sale, the company is moving from smaller to larger customers, and there is a new head of sales.

**Section II: Intrinsic Value** 

* Three Stage Growth
   * Zoom is currently in its early-high growth stage and will continue to benefit from high revenue growth for several years to come
      * I expect this growth to significantly fade in FYE 2026 to relatively lower and stable rates
   * **There is a strong indication that revenue will grow as a result of customers increasing 20-fold from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in March 2020**
      * **I expect that most of the revenue will result in businesses allowing more employees to work from home due** to the obvious viability of the platform for online meetings and work, which presents the opportunity to downsize offices to cut costs
      * **I still expect the number of customers to go down tremendously from its current high once schools and businesses return to normal operations**
   * Free Cash Flow to Equity approach

**TLDR: Although Zoom should be trading at multiples  higher than its peers as it is a relatively new company and only IPO'd in 2019, the current share price (as of 4/20/2020) is way ahead of itself. With speculative high-growth stocks one should pay closer attention to the PEG Ratio rather than the P/E ratio (PEG of 1 indicates it is neither overvalued or undervalued; <1 is undervalued; >1 is overvalued)** In conclusion, I feel that ZM is highly overvalued when compared to its peers, the DCF yields a stock range that shows Zoom is overvalued as well, but that it justifies higher multiples and ratios. I want to emphasize that given the current market situation, a likely bear market cycle for the greater part of the year, Zoom is trading significantly higher than it should be. On top of this, its PEG ratio (over 1 is considered overvalued) shows that the stock is significantly higher than its projected EPS growth as well as that it has a high P/E ratio to begin with. 

**TLDR; TLDR:** Appropriate range according to peers: $70-$85 --> More appropriate range would be $85-$100 taking into account my FCFE model (which is very difficult to conduct with only four years of financial information)

**Strike and Date:** 8/21 $85p - $100p range ... to be even safer: 11/20 $100p

150,The Zoom bubble is popping,"TL, DR: ZM 100 puts, anytime after June. 

Every autist and his mother knew this was an absurd retard bubble. But some of us didn't have the balls to buy puts, because who knew how long this preposterous bubble, fueled by amateur investors saying to themselves ""hey, everyone's using Zoom! They must be raking it in!""

We knew this was bullshit because ZM is currently trading at a P/E ratio of nearly two-thousand. TWO THOUSAND. Even if you don't believe in any sort of fundamental analysis, you can see that that's fundamentally ridiculous (see what I did there?)

It's ridiculous because Zoom has no way of ever making money. They offer a product–video conferencing–which people don't expect to pay for, in the long run. Facebook announced on Friday that they're going to be rolling out FREE video conferencing for up to 50 people, and you don't even need to have a FB account to use it. Expect Google to join the party soon. 

The only reason companies currently pay for Zoom is because it's the 'professional' way to video chat. FB won't change that, but something clever linked to Gmail will. (Something better than hangouts, obvs). FB and Google will be able to give this service away for free. Zoom has no other products. 

Zoom has no stickiness - this isn't a social network folks. There's no need to acquire this company. People have zero loyalty to it. Businesses aren't integrated with Zoom with an API or something. They just pay a middling 25$ per user fee. Everyone will drop this in a second if there's something better and free. 

The stock dropped dramatically on Friday when FB made the announcement. This week everybody is going to realize everything I just wrote.

Pulled from SA.

The Verge caught Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) quietly editing a prior blog post to boast 300M daily meeting participants rather than daily active users.

A DAU is only counted once per day, while a meeting participant is counted every time they turn up in a meeting. Three meetings a day means one person counts three times.

In a statement to The Verge, Zoom says the wording was ""a genuine oversight on our part.""

166,ZM: why the market may be substantially underestimating the upside,"When I saw everyone shitting on Zoom as an undifferentiated hype stock at WSB, figured there may be a contrarian play, so started doing some digging. Just my view - disclosure, obviously long shares and calls, a few FDs included. Earnings coming up in early June and think there's 2-3x price appreciation potential in the next 6-12 mos. 

TLDR: Zoom undervalued at anything less than $200 a share as market discounting new subscribers. Sorry for the bullet formatting, I tried. 

High level thesis: 
*	Market underestimating the impact of daily participants growth from 10MM/day at end of 2019 to 300MM/day as of early April
*        	While education and other venues have received free access, this does not explain the broader growth. There are 60-70MM people in US at school age. Assuming 25% using Zoom at 5x instances a day, that yields 80-100MM of the 290MM growth from education
*      	Both new and existing enterprise Zoom users have likely rapidly increased adoption in the last 90 days, adding more paying users per company than previously assumed (e.g., a firm with 50 employees that may have shared 4-5 licenses or used a free version is now ramping usage)
*	High free cash flow, subscription revenue business provides visibility into earnings potential on an annualized, runrate basis
*      	Subscription based model that is a small cost per employee, especially compared to traveling for in person meetings (e.g., annual subscription a fraction of the cost of one business trip per year)
*      	Market will price ZM on a quarterly runrate basis derived from paying users, which will be reported in early June along with MD&A on new users through that date
*	Continued COVID issues will drive subscription and paying user growth
*      	Early state reopenings will drive companies to delay return to work and travel due to risks of virus continuing to circulate (e.g., many financial firms banning travel until 2021); consensus for a 2nd wave in the 2H of 2021
*      	Despite reopenings, dual income households unable to go to work due to childcare constraints as schools, daycares, and camps closed until the fall or beyond
*      	COVID accelerating long term shift toward remote working; commercial air travel to remain challenged for next 6-12 months (Evercore surveys point to investors’ belief that business travel does not recover until 2H2021) further entrenching people being comfortable working from home or doing remote meetings
*	Competitive moat built through brand, GUI, and early mover advantage
*      	Zoom is a name brand in the business community; technology not just an app but becomes entrenched in conference room set-ups, internal company procedures and IT stack
*      	Cost of service is de minimis for recent competitive activity from Google or Facebook to matter ($120/user/year not worth behavioral change/shift requirements)
*      	ZM preferred due to GUI, user friendliness (prior to it being banned, Google’s own employees overwhelmingly preferred Zoom and company considered buying Zoom)
*      	Other larger tech companies have challenges in switching Zoom users (FB: personal privacy and bridge to enterprise applications; GOOG: niche user base and need to be in GOOG ecosystem; MSFT: clunky user interface embedded in complex Teams universe, slow to roll out upgrades)

In terms of the risks / bear case for the story, common questions and concerns are the following:

*	Valuation too high: “1000 PE,” “ridiculous revenue multiple” to be addressed shortly. Net net there is visibility into near term runrate $2B in annualized EBITDA, which at a 50x multiple (appropriate given growth), implies substantial price upside
*	“Muh competition”: addressed above. Solutions provided by FB are geared toward social users (who are not paying and ZM doesn’t want anyway); MSFT is too clunky and ZM viewed as a complementary application; GOOG: not everyone wants a gmail account and even Google’s own employees prefer Zoom. Thankfully for the bull case, all these threats are now out in the open and “priced in”
*	All the growth will go away post COVID: 1) COVID not going away anytime soon (see: second wave, mutations, too early openings, residual fears; 2) post conversion, video conferencing will still be used, particularly to save on corporate travel and will replace conference calls that were done prior to COVID. Additionally, companies will want this capability in place for risk mitigation/business continuity. Given this, the subscription users will stay in place and continue to convert from free users 3) the education (K-12/college) users who will go away weren’t paying and will plant seeds for future growth as they join the workforce 4) the growth in users was 30x in the course of 30-60 days
*	“Muh security concerns and Zoom bombing”: acquisition of KeyBase + Eric’s 90 day plan appears to be allaying concerns. Separately, the security concerns appear to be hyped up by competitors vs. actual threats – a number of reputable firms continue to onboard Zoom and NYC schools has reversed its decision. Just note that FB channeled Russian hackers on its platform that changed the outcome of US elections and appears to not effect its valuation. 

Valuation: the gutcheck – stock has appreciated ~2x pre-COVID though daily participants have grown 30x. All else being equal, market is discounting a substantial portion of upside growth. However, it is important to note that FYQ2 (the next quarter being reported for period ending 4/30) will not nearly reflect the runrate performance given most of the recent surge happened late in the quarter. 

*	Context of where we are and what we know about the numbers
**	In the most recent quarter ending January, Zoom generated $188MM in revenue and $10MM of EBITDA. It is important to note that Zoom operates at 82-83% gross margin (that means each incremental dollar generates 80 cents of profit or EBITDA assuming no scale up of backoffice and overhead). Said differently, it is very cheap for Zoom to support incremental user growth as is with most software/subscription businesses
**	On an annualized basis pre-COVID, Zoom was generating roughly $800MM in revenue and $40MM of EBITDA. The low EBITDA margins are due to the SG&A/overhead that has yet to be (but soon will be) leveraged
**	Exiting the most recent quarter, Zoom had 10MM daily participants, which translates into ~$75 of annualized revenue per daily participant (includes both paying and non-paying participants). Note that this 10MM includes those who used the platform for free prior to COVID, so if the same mix of paying and non-paying participants continued, you’d see an unbelievably large ramp in revenue and earnings
**	Zoom grew to 200MM daily participants in early April, then 300MM toward the end of April
**	Obviously, you can’t just take the 300MM x $75 a year factor, which would translate into $24B in annualized revenue – it is likely a larger percentage of free users joined, including college and K-12 students. The question is what %? That’s what I will lay out below. 

*	 Valuing the growth potential – anything less than $200/share is drastically undervaluing Zoom
**	The question is then of the 290MM new daily participants, how closely does that match to the profile of the preexisting 10MM daily participants. That is what we will then apply the $80/annualized revenue figure
**	Being conservative, let’s just assume 20%. That implies 58MM out of the 290MM new daily participants that match the mix of paying/non-paying as pre-COVID users and that the rest of the 230MM will not pay at all
**	That yields to an INCREMENTAL annualized revenue figure of $4.4B ($75/year x 58MM)
**	Back to our gross margin point, Zoom generates 82-83% gross margins
**	Instead of doing a straight calculation on that as flow through, let’s assume another 20-25% cost on the incremental revenue in additional SG&A as well as costs to serve the incremental free users
**	$4.4B x 60% = $2.2B in annualized operating profit (EBITDA)
**	So how do we value ZM on that basis? Question is comparable TEV / EBITDA multiples for fast growing software/SAAS businesses:
***	CRM: 55x LTM EBITDA (35% revenue growth), 8x revenue (more mature, lower margin biz)
***   TDOC: not profitable; 20x LTM Revenue
***	DOCU: not profitable, 20x LTM Revenue
***	TWLO: not profitable, 17x LTM Revenue
**	Assuming a 15x revenue multiple for ZM on runrate revenue ($5B total runrate) = $75B TEV, or $250 share price on 300M shares
***	Assuming a 50x EBITDA multiple like CRM: $108B TEV, or $360 share price
***	Assuming a 30x EBITDA multiple: $65B TEV, $215 share price
**	Now, assume 50x EBITDA and what the value would be if greater than 20% of the new users looked like the profile of Zoom’s existing users, should it be 30 or 50%: 
***	30%: $580/share at 50x EBITDA, $350/share at 30x
***	50%: $1,015/share at 50x, $600/share at 30x, $400/share at 20x (at larger TEV, multiple will be lower as more growth has been realized

169,I'm Bullish on Shopify For The Long Term But Short Term I Would Sell,"As the title says, this is my current thesis on Shopify. Here is why:

1) Their growth is still going up 50% yoy

2) Current pandemic is a tailwind for ecommerce. New Customers are flooding in and Shopify is getting the more data than ever from customers on how to improve their product since these businesses now DEPEND upon Shopify's platform to live. For any business, the user research is always the hardest and can cause a business to fail if there is not enough data to understand the overall market.

3) Shopify has built themselves an ecosystem in which their merchants essentially get trapped in. But this isn't a bad thing because within an ecosystem, things run smoothly. Each of their different products are built to work with one another and the processes are a lot more smooth compared to piecing together a bunch of different services that are from various companies. By going the DIY route, if one service changes dramatically, it could break a stores entire sales process.

4) Shopify has a stellar balance sheet with current ratio of 8-9. People would have scorned at this before the pandemic but now companies who are 3 months away from defaulting wish they had a balance sheet like Shopify's

5) Management raised capital at the right time with the share price just over $1000CAD. They probably knew that the stock was way overvalued but this allows them to essentially get cheap cash without needing to give out as much equity. It may be an indication to investors that management thinks the stock price is overvalued (which I believe they think this is the case) but being prudent with finances, they capitalize on this opportunity with a prediction that these favourable prices won't be around for long.

6) Shopify Fulfilment is one of the last pieces of the puzzle to complete their ecommerce ecosystem that will basically take Shopify merchants to Amazon level of service. Currently the biggest pain point as a Shopify seller myself is shipping times. Customers often drop off when they see a shipping time of 5-7 days and can find a product that is comparable on Amazon with a shipping time of 1-2 days. Who wouldn't go with the Amazon option unless you have no other choice. Amazon prices are very competitive as well and the margins are low. Shopify recognizes that their merchants need a fulfilment service in order to match Amazon sellers. We live in the instant world and people HATE waiting. All the other ecommerce sites out there seem to be sleeping on this front and I believe that this will help the next leg of growth for Shopify.

7) Advertisement is the cherry on top that will be coming in the next few years. Shopify recently announced their Shop app which is essentially a virtual mall where you can add all your favourite shopify stores. Once this app gets flushed out, people can have a ""mall"" experience in their hands at any time. With an app like this, Shopify will likely start selling advertisements to their clients just like malls sell info kiosk space. Also Shopify can sell search terms just like the digital map kiosks do.

I have other thoughts I've laid out on Shopify in my Shopify series on Youtube if you are interested in following along as I track what I believe is Canada's best company. [https://youtu.be/79vZM\_v-W9I](https://youtu.be/79vZM_v-W9I)

Currently I do not own a position in Shopify though because of the elevated prices and I will be looking to make an entry into the stock if it drops down to the $500 level. I believe this is possible if there is a second wave of the pandemic as Shopify is an extremely volatile stock if you look at the charts. People will also begin to realize that the current valuation of the company is ludicrous and thats when I plan to take my position.

I would love to hear your thoughts whether you are a bull or a bear as we are all here to learn from each other. Every person brings their own perspective and the more we understand each other, the better we understand the stock market because the stock market is essentially the collection of all investors thoughts on what a company is worth!

Happy investing :)",2020-05-16 12:38:56
170,About to liquidate the 75% of the positions I bought since the March/April dip,"Just placed the orders for first thing on Monday in the morning.

Stuff like SHOP, ZM, WORK, TEAM, DOCU, OKTA, TTD, TDOC and even SEDG, ENPH plus SQ, PYPL, MA.

Pretty good companies, don't get me wrong, but I feel the current valuations are a bit crazy.

Not going to lie, I'm a bit nervous since I believe in most of the companies (ENPH I hope our paths cross again), but not in the valuations and the current status of the economy. Took a very nice >30% profit, and I'm still DCA'ing my ETFs but this is it for me for this run.

The remaining 25% is basically FB, DIS, CCL and BABA, which I'm more confortable with the current valuations.

Bear gang, treat me well. Good luck to everyone.

UPDATE: I could have avoided saying this (more so after all the fuzz)... but it wouldn't be fair: After reading ALL comments and further thought, instead of directly selling I've set an stop loss of about 5-15% in all the mention, that I will be updating every other day. Thanks everyone, glad that I posted this, otherwise I wouldn't have done it but I think it is the very best solution. Happy trading everyone and stay safe.",2020-05-17 06:04:53
171,Is Zoom (ZM) way overvalued or am I missing something?,"I think maybe I need a bull's perspective on why this stock should have the valuation it has right now. The current PE is over 2000 and even if they keep growing at the rate they have been, some quick math ( high earnings forecast on yahoo) tells me it wouldn't go below 221 for 2022.

The Company seems fine, altough I think the security flaws ( that are probly fixed now) will probly have detered a lot of companies. At their current prices they would need 110 mil companies using the platform to get a PE of 60, if we'd assume a crazy 30% profit margin ( current profit margin is 2%). Imagine every paid user has 4 other ppl in the same call. That would give half a billion people using zoom. Even right now, with the lock down, that would be crazy.

Google has recently made Hangouts basicly free and Microsoft's Teams and Skype also look like tough competition for a startup. 

It feels like the market is priced to the best of the best scenario, but maybe I'm just missing something?

I've been thinking of selling call (probly strike 200- 250) options that expire jan 2022. Would be a very nice profit if the stock goes down or even sideways, and this way I don't have to nail the timing.
Edit: The reason I want to sell leaps is that I can't short stocks where I live and this mimics it well, pls tell me if I can do something better I'm still new to options.",2020-05-17 07:07:42

174,When to call it quits and seek advice from a financial advisor,"Any advice would be appreciated. I have been investing in M1 finance for about 2 years now, intially I was buying partial stocks and doing it for fun and sticking to solid dividend companies like KO and WM, I ended up building a portfolio over 30 stocks for roughly 3k.  Later on my buddies told just to invest in etf and ""go about your life"" so I ended up taking a 30k position in SPYD. Covid19 hit and I took my first loss (like most people), but I didn't sell and doubled down on some positions like KO, O, WM thinking they will shelter the storm. Recently I started branching out to more growth stocks and ended up buying a subscription to Motley Fool for some investment advice and took up significant positions in ZM, DocuSign and OKTA after doing some research.

I currently have a high paying job, doing my company match ,looking into IRAs and I have an good emergency fund saved. I have a history of gambling addiction and I started to get the same feeling like I had when gambling. I routinely talk to a relative about stocks since he has been investing successfully all his life to make sure my investing strategy isn't crazy. I am in my early thirties and my goal with investing is not to hit it big, but to not be like my grandfather and father working till the day they die just to put food on the table.",2020-05-17 23:41:42

177,Criticize my plan,"Hear me out, then feel free to rip my plan apart.

I have a HYSA.  Earns like $500/year in interest.  So I took 10% and put it into a brokerage account.  I buy $100-$200 in stocks (bought TSLA once) at a time.  So if DIS is a $100/share, I buy 1 or 2.

My goal is to beat my interest in earnings.  So far I have earned $732 in realized. I’m down $180 in unrealized losses.

It’s fun. I watch CNBC and make trades off of common sense.  Like buying home improvement off the bounce. 

My strategy has been to sell a stock if it goes higher than 20% gain, no matter what. 

Big winners for me are TSLA, SPCE, ZM, HD, TDOC, DOCU, PYPL, TEAM, GLD, SHW

Losers are hold until 12/31.

Right now, I’m holding lots of the cyclical value plays: TRIP, H, UAL, Royal Carib

182,When to short Zoom (NYSE: ZM),"Wondering what everyone's opinions are on slowly building up puts on zm over the next 1-2 months. Although I hope the general macro catalyst for zoom will largely vanish (i.e. lockdowns) over the course of the year, I'm wondering if people think that over time as more companies aim to encourage WFH that such software will be able to support something close to its current valuation. That being said, ZM definitely faces significant competition in both the casual and enterprise space with platforms like Teams being much better integrated with other enterprise tools (Office, OneDrive, etc.) as well as simply being more powerful. 

Given what its trading around now (170 level) I think it may be the case that we've established a top for zoom. However, that could easily change. Thoughts?",2020-05-22 16:07:35

184,The $ZM Dilemma,"Prediction:

ZM's increase in premium users will not be enough to offset surge in cloud costs from additional free users, among other things.

Catering to free users who have little chance of being converted/upsold to the premium subscription comes with it's issues. This manifests itself in data usage. ZM will foot the bill for all of the free loaders.

https://www.whistleout.com.au/Broadband/Guides/How-much-data-does-Zoom-use

Although there was a partnership announced with Oracle, it seems AWS has been helping with the majority of the server demand, while ZM pays a premium for uptime.

So who is causing the data use to spike? Premium corporate users? I'd say only partially. The majority of the new users are casual users and schools. Id suggest reading this good analysis here (skip $WORK stuff):

Akrams Razor - ""Zoom out, Slack In"" article on seeking alpha. Can't post link due to restrictions. But Google it.

ZM has stated that +90,000 schools are using the software which they provide for free with no cost, and no 40 minute limit (again large free user data consumption). That means there was 35 - 56ml FREE users per day from those sources. And as we know Zoom reported 300ml daily meeting participants instead of individual users.

https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement

So as an individual user, if you were in x5 meetings in one day you account for x5 ""participations"". If you have a few classes a day as a student, it is likely that 30 - 50% of zooms daily uses was from schools who don't pay a cent.

Zoom has been extremely reluctant to release and clarifying data to show the number of paying customers they have. 

Of the remaining userbase, distinguishing how many free casual use vs paid use is difficult. I'd wager that the vast majority are free users.

Again, is increase in premium users enough to offset:

1) incredible surge in free users hogging bandwidth
2) pay from the +$100M acquisition of Keybase
3) increase in payroll from ZM announcing they are going to hire 300-500 US based engineers (which most likely them trying to erase the China image they have)
4) higher allocation of profits to R&D


My prediction is that the cost of revenue metric is going to increase dramatically from last quarter.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020.

# **Expect more shocking economic data in the week ahead with the unemployment rate set to near 20%  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/expect-more-shocking-economic-data-in-the-week-ahead-with-the-unemployment-rate-set-to-near-20percent.html)**
*****
> The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead.
*****
> Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market.
*****
> The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China’s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters. 
*****
> President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump’s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China.
*****
> “Hovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.
*****
> “We saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,” she said. “The market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.”
*****
> Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.
*****
> “There’s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,” he said. “There’s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.”
*****
> Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. 
*****
> “This cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we’ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,” he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn’t always signal positives. 
*****
> “On average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,” he said.
*****
> Emanuel said the S&P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.

> # Equities

> US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**

> “The S&P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Which would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn’t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.”

> The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.

> Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.

> Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

> # International Stocks

> The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng’s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong’s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.

> The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.

> European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.

> # Fixed Income and Commodities

> Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.

> Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.

> Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.

> Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.

> # Looking Ahead

> Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.

> On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday’s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.

*****

# Strong Breadth Surge

> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.

> Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn’t mean they’ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy’s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday’s close, 96% of the components in the S&P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.

> Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

> “Breadth surges like we’ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.”

# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June’s First Trading Day

> According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA’s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.

# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month

> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.

# May's Top Performing Stocks

> After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.

> This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.

> Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.

> In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.

# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991

> As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).

# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm

> The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.

> Equity fund flows remain negative. While there’s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.

> Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",2020-05-30 08:50:41
191,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020.

# **Expect more shocking economic data in the week ahead with the unemployment rate set to near 20%  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/expect-more-shocking-economic-data-in-the-week-ahead-with-the-unemployment-rate-set-to-near-20percent.html)**
*****
> The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead.
*****
> Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market.
*****
> The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China’s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters. 
*****
> President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump’s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China.
*****
> “Hovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.
*****
> “We saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,” she said. “The market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.”
*****
> Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.
*****
> “There’s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,” he said. “There’s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.”
*****
> Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. 
*****
> “This cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we’ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,” he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn’t always signal positives. 
*****
> “On average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,” he said.
*****
> Emanuel said the S&P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.
*****
> But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. “When we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,” he said. 
*****
> The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.  
*****
> “These stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don’t think we’ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there’s a change in progress on a vaccine,” he said.
*****
> President Trump’s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism.
*****
> Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter’s stock hardest.  
*****
> Emanuel said technology’ is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues.
*****
> In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.

> # Equities

> US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**

> “The S&P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Which would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn’t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.”

> The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.

> Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.

> Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

> # International Stocks

> The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng’s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong’s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.

> The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.

> European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.

> # Fixed Income and Commodities

> Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.

> Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.

> Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.

> Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.

> # Looking Ahead

> Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.

> On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday’s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.

*****

# Strong Breadth Surge

> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.

> Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn’t mean they’ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy’s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday’s close, 96% of the components in the S&P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.

> Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

> “Breadth surges like we’ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.”

# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June’s First Trading Day

> According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA’s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.

# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month

> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.

# May's Top Performing Stocks

> After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.

> This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.

> Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.

> In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.

# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991

> As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).

# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm

> The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.

> Equity fund flows remain negative. While there’s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.

> Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.

192,Why is ZM releasing earnings estimates for a year from now?,I’m a futures trader and new to trading individual names and i see ZM is releasing estimates on Tuesday for Q1/21.  Is this what’s called forward guidance and no actual earnings are being released?  I was looking at about 5 other tech companies on Estimize and they didn’t do these far out estimates - they just release their results.  It seems insane and nearly useless to guess what ZMs earnings would be a year from now.  What number are people really looking at on Tuesday?  Thanks!,2020-05-31 12:44:56

209,Technology stocks and the problem with Zoom (ZM),"  

Technological stocks are something I rarely, if ever, touch. If I were to ever invest into a technological company, it would be when the fundamentals work. I am an experienced technological user, having played Wheel of Fortune on Windows 98 when I was three. I have a Facebook account, I used to be on Twitter, and I remember when MySpace was the hottest thing around. Regardless, there are many tech stocks that have negative net income, negative book value, and, only last long enough to be bought by an enterprising billionaire (this is how Mark Cuban made his billions). Zoom (ZM)today is the same as Microsoft in the 90’s. Here exists a company that made a decent amount of money and then skyrocketed upwards in the stock market - trading at high price-to-earnings - before falling back to a low multiple. ZM in the future may be a wonderful investment; but, is not worth $53 billion right now.

When stocks are hot, they can do no wrong. In the 1990’s eToys, a company that had little revenue and negative net income, was somehow worth more to the market than Toys R Us, which had positive net income and made more revenue. This is because the mania in the tech company was at an all-time high whilst people were not hot with Toys’ R Us. 

Another example is the 2000 merger of AOL-Time Warner. AOL was valued more than Time Warner despite AOL having less revenue and less net income compared to Time Warner. The leaders of the merger believed that AOL would raise Time Warner to an even higher level. When technological stocks fell in the early-2000’s, AOL-Time Warner lost a bunch of money in both market value and net income. AOL eventually became nothing more than an email server for the elderly.

Zoom is overvalued.  It is currently trading at nearly 2,400 times its' earnings, when generally, a stock should trade with an earnings yield larger than an AAA bond yield. It is trading at fifty-nine times its book value, meaning that their ls little liquidity for the company. The company has little cash (trading at 62 times its' cash value) and little free cash flow (nearly 470 times its' FCF.)

216,Discord bot for day trading queries - new ideas and pilot testers wanted!,"Hi all,  
I've written a chatbot for Discord that returns earnings data (history, report and call dates, estimates, etc.), intraday relative volume from 8am onward, basic fundamentals, implied moves w/ short float, and market down limits when applicable. The idea here is to limit the amount of searching for this information on the internet and consolidate these searches into a single place for trading clubs to share among their members.

Commands are formatted as: !<command> <ticker or comma-separated list of tickers>  
**!eh** displays a grid of historical earnings data  
**!ew** displays next earnings report day with EPS and revenue estimates  
**!ec** displays the next earnings call with call-in or webcast links  
**!f** displays market cap, ATR, shares floating and short interest, average daily volume, beta, and 52-week range  
**!rv** displays current intraday volume from 8am onward  
**!ml** displays S&P market down limits for today  
**!im** displays implied moves and short float

A few examples:  
**!im zm,apps**  
Ticker: ZM  
Implied Move Weekly: 14.55%  
Short Float: 9.47%  
\------------------------------------------------------------  
Ticker: APPS  
Implied Move Monthly: 23.72%  
Short Float: 5.75%

**!ew tdoc**

218,WORK (Slack Technologies) discussion and thoughts,"WORK reported earnings this evening and their stock is down to the tune of almost 20% currently after the report. 

This seems like an irrational reaction to the ER (as is often the case with these things). They did not report anything that should cause such a dump on the stock (imo anyway).

While they did not report astronomical growth as the likes of ZM (Zoom), they showed continued, sustained growth YoY, which in many cases is better for a long-term outlook as opposed to a company who explodes in growth due to the pandemic but carries risk of not being able to sustain that growth once the pandemic has passed.

I’m considering adding to a longer term position in WORK at these prices. I do already have a small position at a slightly higher cost basis than where it fell to after-hours today, and I’m considering adding more. Granted, the stock has rallied a lot since the beginning of the year and it may need a breather before continuing, but I don’t see this dump as justified in my personal opinion.

Any others with thoughts on WORK?

Here are some quick details on their ER:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/04/slack-work-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/04/slack-work-earnings-q1-2021.html)",2020-06-04 19:03:51
219,Bearish outlook on Zoom,"I might be completely wrong but I've been observing $ZM since the early start of the pandemic, and I don't believe the stock is a good long-term play. Here are the reasons why I am bearish on the company:

* **Competitive space**. Zoom is competing with many other video conferencing tools: Google Meet (previously, Google Hangouts, $GOOG/L), Skype as well as Teams ($MSFT), and Slack (also offering video calls aside from chat, $WORK) to name a few. All of these provide both free and enterprise plans, and as you can see, many of them are backed by big monopoly tech. There are also smaller players trying to break through like join.me.
* **Security concerns**. Zoom does not have proper end-to-end encryption. It's been found to transmit its encryption keys and even route the actual calls through China, supposedly by mistake. Despite being a Silicon Valley company, they have much of their staff in China as well. The software itself has been through several privacy scandals, particularly in June 2019 with MacOS users discovering that their camera could be activated by malicious sites due to a vulnerability in Zoom.
* **Government regulation**. Zoom has alleged ties to China, and with the current US-China tensions, it's at high risk of being regulated. It's already been banned from use by several government agencies (NASA, military) and companies (Google, SpaceX). The precedent has already been set with Huawei, and if the anti-China sentiment and trade sanctions continue to grow, possibly evolving into a cold war, you can expect more scrutiny directed towards this company.
* **Inflated fundamentals**. The stock is currently trading at a P/E near 6,000 and is slightly down from its ATH this week. It's likely priced for perfection in anticipation of very strong demand even as the economy continues to re-open. Even if you're optimistic about the work-from-home culture and online learning, it's hard to justify its current valuation that probably only compares to that of $SHOP or $OKTA.

Again, I could be 100% wrong, but I don't think Zoom stands a chance against the big tech like Google and Microsoft. Those are diversified monopoly companies that could push Zoom out of the video conferencing space, especially with the help of government intervention from the US and EU. Zoom may still find a market in Asia, possibly Russia and Africa, but I believe its prospects in the Western world are rather grim.

7 days up so far for the SPY now slightly gapping down pre market. Maybe today we get a pullback but don't be surprised if we don't.

232,ZM: Market Still Undervaluing the Upside - Part 2,"You can see my original post here - compare and contrast the revenue estimates vs. what was actually achieved: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf8qf4/zm_why_the_market_may_be_substantially/

I won't go into extraneous detail, though the ZM Q1 earnings release and conference call transcript had some really interesting  data points, to the extent it was called the ""best quarter in enterprise software history.""

I expect to get massively downvoted as ZM has attracted a lot of haters and losers the last several weeks who don't appreciate the upside and the cash machine that is this business. People seem to think because other VC solutions exist that suck and don't get traction or because usage has ramped massively during COVID that for some reason is bearish. 

In any event, here are the quick takeaways:

Massive Q1 above anyone's wildest dreams: $330M in revenue vs. $200M consensus. Note, ZM's quarter ends in April that they reported. This means that some of March and all of April contributed somewhere around $130MM of revenue upside. Gee, what does that mean for a annual license/subscription business? $130MM / 6 weeks x 52 weeks = $1.2B of annualized new revenue above their trailing twelve months that has been secured. This figure excludes any customers added since 4/30 (and ZM has been the top downloaded app in May and June). 

Second, customers greater than 10 employees grew 354% YoY (compared to 170% revenue growth). This means that the runrate of the business is substantially higher than what the quarterly revenue implies.

Third, as of the latest quarter, ZM had 769 customers with more than $100K in revenue, an increase of 128 QoQ. In the most recent quarter, they added over 500 customers with annualized revenue runrates of over $100K. 

Fourth - and one of the big underappreciated wildcards - international grew 246% YoY compared to 150% for North America. With COVID rampaging in India, LATAM, Russia, and other nations, this will provide momentum. As of now, OUS sales are only 25% of ZM's revenue despite being 85% of global GDP. 

Fifth - guidance - they expect Q2 to have $0.44-0.46 / share earnings. That means they are runrating at nearly $2/share. They also assume $500MM in quarterly revenue for Q2. Let's take a look at that. In Q1, they expected $200M but delivered $330M based on a surge in business in the last month of the quarter due to COVID. Assuming no net new customers added in Q2 (and no churn - and new customers would more than offset churn), they should deliver $200M + ($130M x 3) = $600M in sales, again, assuming no net new business. Assuming the incremental $100M vs. guidance flows through at 60% to be safe, that's another $0.20/share. Now, how many new customers would they have added? Probably a fuckload, at least another $100-$150M worth of net new business. I would apply a 60% flow through on this as well incremental to mgmt's forecast. 

So that means Q2 is likely in the range of $0.70-$1.00/share for earnings, taking FY2020 to somewhere between $2.20-$3.20/share of earnings compared to mgmt guidance of $1.50. This implies a runrate of $4.00 a share of earnings. 

So, what's that worth? What PE ratio is appropriate for a massively ramping earnings play printing cash? Apply a 70x PE ratio on $4, you get $280. Apply 100x, you get $400. Apply 50x revenue multiple like other fast growth software companies, that gets you to $400+ as well. 

""Muh competition"" and ""muh becky will stop using it""

The concern around monthly prosumers is overstated (those with employees less than 10 people) - this only accounts for 30% of their revenue in the latest quarter, compared to 20% historically. This reflects in increase of about $30-$40M. The downside from churn is much more limited than people think.

236,$AMZN want to $WORK,"A couple of weeks ago, on June the  1st,  an internal memo advised around 45k AWS employees that, starting  from the next day, they would have started using Slack as their main  official internal chat. Most of AWS employees have already been using it  for unofficial purposes, but thanks to the new Enterprise license they  can now handle direct support for their high-tier-customers and  obviously internal conversations.

Slack  Enterprise packet costs around (mean) $75 per month/per user. Adding  AWS employees (not counting Amazon and affiliated companies full force  for now) adds up to (around) $40M per year to $WORK revenue, which is  about 10% of 2019 revenue or 7%  of 2020 estimated revenue.

At  the present moment, as discussed in other posts, the main competitors  in the business chat field are $MSFT Office and  $GOOGL Suite, leaving  $AMZN with its Chime (internal) videochat solution, which is going to be  fully integrated in Slack. For this purpose a new internal memo advised  the Chime developers that they would soon be joined by new workforce to  pursue the aforementioned integration. Of course we also know that  these are the three main opponents in the cloud business field as well  (Azure, GCloud and AWS).

One of  the main stakeholders in $WORK is $SFTBF, which is now facing some  exponential losses within its startup investments (e.g.: WeWork,  Brandless, Oyo). On the other side we have $BRK exposed on $AMZN (though  arriving too late as per Mr. Buffett words) and, course Mr. Bezos  himself.

([SGMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=sgmd)) (“Sugarmade”, “SGMD”, or the “Company”), and its BudCars Cannabis Delivery Service (“BudCars”), is excited to announce record growth in gross profits and gross profit margins for BudCars sales during the month of May (up 46% on a sequential month-over-month basis), and continued strong signals so far during the first half of June, with gross profits growing 9.9% on a week-over-week basis. 

The Company believes this performance data provides a template for its per unit operational performance anticipated as it gears up to launch its first Los Angeles hub next month. The Los Angeles cannabis market is arguably the biggest municipal legal cannabis market in the world, and the Company conservatively estimates that its first LA hub will add at least $20 million in annualized sales, with a similar anticipated gross margin profile.

“As we gear up to open our first new hub in the Los Angeles regional market, we continue to see very good signs from our Sacramento hub, with the very rapid topline growth clearly translating to the bottom line as margins hold up and even improve,” commented Jimmy Chan, CEO of Sugarmade. “As we recently reiterated, BudCars is not a delivery business comparable to GrubHub or Uber Eats. It is a top cannabis retail business with very consistent 46-52% gross margins on a wholesale inventory with very secure logistical underpinnings. This differentiation has been a source of misunderstanding, and it is critical to fully appreciating our value proposition and our strategy as a Company moving forward.”

Management notes that May was the Company’s best month on record as far as total gross profits since taking operational control of BudCars, a mark that looks certain to be surpassed by the Company’s performance in June, as growth in sales and gross profits continues to race ahead at approximately 10% on a week-over-week basis.

As noted in the Company’s June 4 press release, BudCars will surpass $10 million in annualized sales by the month of August at its Sacramento location provided the Company maintains its current pace of growth.

In addition, management believes that performance seen at the BudCars Sacramento hub provides a strong basis for understanding key dynamics that will shape operational performance at the Company’s initial southern California BudCars hub, as the Company moves toward the opening of its first Los Angeles location.

238,When to take profits?,"Hi everyone, 

I wanted to see if anyone had a good articles or strategies on taking profits within your portfolio.

I have a been investing individual stocks for past 3 years and a number of my stocks that have hit the 100% and 200% gain territory in the last year (ZM, TTD, CWRD, OKTA, DDOG, TSLA and few other approach the 100% gain range COUP, BYND).

I believe in all of the companies for foreseeable future and plan to hold for at least 3-5+ years barring any changes to sector / competition (I have a B2B tech background which is why most of these stocks are in a single sector as I have a good pulse on what tech trends are on the upswing).

However this spring has made me very aware that there are factors that can impact the entire market significantly.  I wish I had more capital back in March and April to buy more of my positions when they dipped but I didn’t because I hadn’t pulled any profits from these big gains.  

So my question is how do most of you handle your big wins and when to pull some money out to either buy a dip of the same stock or buy another stock you want exposure to?

My general strategy has been to pull my initially investment somewhere in the 150% - 200% gain and let the rest (essentially my profit) continue to ride out until I don’t have faith that the stock won’t beat the market.  Should this strategy be tweaked at all?",2020-06-16 11:09:59
239,ZM is up again and I’m sure now it will test the big mindset price of 250. This is an epic pump,"I imagine an epic dump / fail. Amazon teaming up with slack. Microsoft teams is strong. This stock is just an autistic concentrated pump until earnings come out

Anyone still buying calls?

I’m doubling down on my fall puts on this piece of shit. Their earnings going to send it back to $150",2020-06-17 08:51:26
240,Thoughts on ZM among others in the near future,"This stock has seen amazing growth amongst the COVID-19 crisis. Now that quarantine policy is slowly on a reversal to save the economy, what do you think the future may hold for this and other stocks in the same category.

It is my own understanding that it’s probable that corona will make a comeback in case numbers, so we could see future quarantining as a possibility, thereby keeping the demand for stocks like ZM high. Inversely, quarantining may continue to subside, and ZM among others could see a drop. 

I am new to investing and this is my take, but I am more interested in hearing from more experienced people like you all on this topic.",2020-06-19 00:46:11
241,"Before You ""YOLO"" LCDX Do Your Damn Research","Tinkering around with google today I saw some trending topics about Lucid Motors stock and people searching for Lucid Motors stock price. So I did some research. It befuddled me that I couldn't find anything on Lucid's stock price. But then I remembered the whole TWTR/TWTRQ debacle from 2013. I also found [an article talking about this exact scenario](https://pennystocks.com/featured/2020/06/19/penny-stocks-mistaken-identity-lucid-motors-stock/). 

Not only TWTR v TWTRQ but for those who are new to the market, you'll know about ZM vs ZOOM where people flocked to a BS, dark penny stock because they thought they were getting in early. So I did a search for any stock resembling lucid. I came across an EV company that was supposed to merge into SHLL...this is NOT lucid, but actually a company called Hyliion Inc. that is merging into Tortoise Acquisition Corp. which appears to be doing the same transaction type as VTIQ and NKLA.

Anyway, I found a random penny stock, LCDX trading with its highest volume in recent history. It's listed on TD as ""Lucid Inc."" but, as that article pointed out too, it actually announced a name change in 2012! It should have been changed to Caliber Imaging & Diagnostics. This ""Lucid"" is not the same Lucid and Lucid Motors stock. Don't be an idiot lol.  And if you do buy LCDX, a dark and defunct penny stock, understand that it's been dark for nearly 6 years and that's on you if you buy the hype and get burned.",2020-06-19 12:31:40
242,"DD: $ZM Major owner of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. just converted 6,000,000 options","[Documentation of form 4 etc](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/4/summary/?id=8044199)



DD: Major owner of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. just converted 6,000,000 options


The Emergence Capital Partner III fund converted and distributed 6 million shares of class B into Class A shares to the fund's limited partners. 

Basically, when this happens non-affiliates (non board, executive officers,etc) of the fund, receive clean dtc elgible stock. Generally, it will take 10-15 business days for the lawyers of the transfer agent + fund to give these shares the okay to be transferred to your brokerage account. 

Be honest folks. This company has a great video client. That's really it. There were other companies that had a great easy copy-able shtick. Groupon? Remember when that little shit pranced around at 240 dollars? Snap? Netscape? Barnes/nobles? 

Other platforms are going to say, ""nice job! Hope you can find some other way to make money because we're going to offer your premium product for free!""

If you were an investor who just received brand spanking new stock? Your costbasis at 5 dollars or w/e. Your capital gains worries set at 15% already. Why the hell wouldn't you sell/dump?



TL:DR:
Best guesstimate is 3-6 million(don't know what the exact distribution between lp is exactly) new shares will be sold by 'unaffilliated' limited partners within the next 10-15 *business days. If you are holding a long position, you might want to consider getting out. Shorts? Get ready. Not a financial advisor do your homework. 

Positions: 10 7/24 227.5 strikes. Umm also, this is a virus stock, thus it has more retard strength than your average stock... If these burn to the ground, i'm going for leaps.

243,Stock tips - Trading on Breakouts,"What're your thoughts on my checklist for Trading on Breakout? Do you think you can add or remove something?

Main Criteria

* Prior consolidation must be existing
* There should be a breakout of consolidation  
* A huge volume must be present 

Secondary Criteria

*  Breakout candle should have the longest range in the past 10 days (2 weeks)  
*  There should be a new 2-month price high 
*  Price closed above 50% of the current day’s range or better 

I did a case study on ZM (Zoom) to prove the above signs to execute trades on breakouts here:

245,Making the switch to ETFs... here are my potential holdings. Let’s find gold,"Built my bankroll swing trading and now it’s time to settle down and transfer my investments for the long haul. Love companies like NET, MSFT, DIS, RTX, DKNG, SHOP, TELSA. This would be my goal high risk high reward portfolio. 

I’ve always been anti ETF, seems like they never move and even if their biggest holdings do well they can go down.

Well I cashed out my holdings in my trading app and am transferring to my big boy portfolio. Here are my holdings. 

First off screw spy and voo. Boring

I went sectors I was interested in for example I love DraftKings and NET but who knows if the competition comes out of nowhere and eats them up. So let’s go with BETZ and WCLD

So here’s my ETFs I’ll be buying into and some of their top holdings.

BUYZ- AMZN, SHOP, SE, BABA, Mercado-
Online shopping if the future

WCLD- Fastly, ZM, DDOG, DOCU, Wix-
Everything will be on the cloud 

BETZ- GAN, DKNG, Flutter, PENN-
It’s like investing in alcohol during the prohibition 

XNTK- Telsa, SHOP, AMZN, AMD, Activison, NVDA-
Who doesn’t love those companies futures 

ARKW- TSLA, SQ, PINS, ROKU-
You had me at Telsa and square leading an ETF

ARKQ- TSLA, 2U, Autodesk, Teradyne-
If telsa doesn’t moon one of these next gen stocks will

QCLN- TSLA and bunch of clean energy stocks-
Shut up I like telsa and oil will go dry eventually right?

IETC - Microsoft, Apple , FB, google-
This was my favorite MSFT heavy etf

PPA- RTX, Lockheed, Honeywell, BA-
Defense stock of choice

FDIS- AMZN, HD, Nike, telsa, McDonald’s -
30% Amazon

PEJ- chipotle, DIS, PENN, LUV-
Favorite Disney etf (IYC gets a shoutout here)

SHE- PayPal, V, MA, Gilead, HD-
My banking etf with the most interesting holdings 

GERM- covid ETF-
I always wanted to invest in the cure(it’s in here) 

PW- my REIT, holds greenhouses for solar energy and marijuana. And railroads. None of which will be affected much when people can’t pay mortgage or start working from home.

I went out of the box, some of these ETFs aren’t priced super high and make it easier for me to keep adding to positions. I think the total holdings were very unique that help with the potential.

Gap Downs: UONE

SPY  Sitting inside of Friday's range, consolidating over the 200 day moving average. Bullish outlook as long as price remains over the 300 area and moving averages. If the market falls today, i'll try to catch a move on the TVIX. If it holds up, then I will look for a continuation of recent momentum.  For active day traders, business as usual.

248,Zooming into ZM,"I was bored at the evening so I dug into ZM a bit. I don't really know what I found, so I may be wrong about this but...

I found that [Santiago Subotovsky](https://fintel.io/n/subotovsky-santiago) as the chief Marketing Officer at *Zoom* Video Communications converted 14 million options to shares at $0 since March 2020. All of which has been transferred to [Emergence Capital Partners III, L.P.](https://fintel.io/so/us/zm/emergence-capital-partners-iii-l-p). This company owned 28,738,825 shares, roughly 20% of Zoom as of January 2020. According to the [Emergence Capital Partners III, L.P. - Net Worth, Insider Trades](https://fintel.io/n/emergence-capital-partners-iii) the currently owned number of shares is 73,168?!

Am I reading this right? Has Mr. Santiago really realized several billions of dollars profit in 6 months on Zoom?",2020-06-22 16:35:49
249,$zm can someone who is bullish on zoom give a reason as to why they believe zoom is a good investment?,"$ZM has been the stock of covid and continues going up. Zoom hit an RSI of over 90, is trading at over 100x of annuals and had an act of God responsible for their best quarter ever.

I'm not sure how one justifies investing at these prices when their moat is so low and have started hemorrhaging paid accounts to Microsoft and Google.

250,"What are ""Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities"" M.S. about to sell on $ZM ?","Ok so I understand stocks, bonds but what kind of engineered fuckery is this? Morgan Stanley LLC recently disclosed the following ""Structured investment / Opportunity in U.S. Equities"" on 6/19/2020

See: https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17027495&gfv=1

I read it and think I understand the basics but am baffled this complex security is even thing. Like the coupon on this dependent on the stock price which really makes me think it'll encourage owners of it to manipulate ZM and pump it every quarter to guarantee payout on the coupons. Cant zoom insiders simply dump or lower price in some form like, should I say it, another offering, to guarantee not paying coupons. Am I understanding this correctly? 

I find this paragraph a bit sketchy, under ""Hedging and trading activity by our affiliates could potentially adversely affect the value of the securities""

""Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could potentially increase the initial share price, and, as a result, could potentially increase the downside threshold price, which is the price at or above which the underlying stock must close on each determination date in order for you to earn a contingent quarterly coupon, and, if the securities are not called prior to maturity, in order for you to avoid being exposed to the negative price performance of the underlying stock at maturity. Additionally, such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities could potentially affect the price of the underlying stock on the determination dates, and, accordingly, whether the securities are automatically called prior to maturity, and, if the securities are not called prior to maturity, the payout to you at maturity, if any""

Another question is who the hell buys this and where the hell do you even buy this? The document states:

""The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and secondary trading may be limited""

I am so confused why such a security is even allowed to exist, can anyone explain why this is a thing?

For the record I am short $ZM and getting rekt.",2020-06-23 23:23:30
251,Opinions on SQ?,"At the peak before corona, SQ was hovering around 80$. Today they’re above 100. How could coronavirus increase SQs stock by 25%?

They own cash app yes but it’s only around 20% of their revenue and is it really blooming that much with the virus? Square makes the vast majority of its revenue from point of sale purchases, where consumers swipe their card in Square devices. 

Most of their market must be mom and pop shops, small cap companies, malls, any brick and mortar store. 

How are they not getting slaughtered right now? Am I missing something?",2020-06-24 21:08:58
252,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

253,"Stock watch List June 26, 2020","Good morning, here's my watch list:

Gap Ups:  AXSM, BIG, CLGX,  EBAY, INO, ROKU, SDGR, SNX (Gapping into 200 DMA),  ZGNX, ZM

Gap Downs: NONE

Possible day 2 plays: DADA (day 2 means it moved yesterday and could possibly be in play today)

SPY gapping down slightly after holding the 200 day moving average support. Bullish action yesterday in most individual stocks. Next support is around the 50 day moving average/last pivot low which is  at the 296/297 area. My outlook remains bullish as long as these levels hold. Some nice gappers today so my focus will be on those names, long, short or both. As always, have stops and targets in place before entering trades to eliminate emotional trading and unnecessary losses. Have a good weekend, stay safe and good luck trading.

254,$CYCA Huge alert - CYTTA Corp IGAN Incident Command System Utilized During Recent Texas Protests," 

*Police Request IGAN to Secure and Protect Texas Communities and Critical Infrastructure*

Las Vegas , June 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  -- [Cytta Corp](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IcfI97aTFBLgo30iX1ymctCGg2QrG__M4zkrDnLIaWstXeaZmAOFwOhm-5BnZ-u8) ([OTCPINK: CYCA)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wH6FRloUG6LBPnzZg9wtzRAOk2t5w0pJ6SQt-8Wt9MQ4n5RiKLuLGoBtyAYTxu2S1QStj2_q1DD0v011i9-Pb_GpnIdI2ftNJMkcbhwUcxZyy9pcCyE1he1cx0mZB-31) Cytta Corp was asked, by a group of North Texas police departments, to utilize its IGAN technology to provide increased video/audio connectivity as part of a coordinated response to major protests happening in a local community. This live operational utilization was a resounding success for the IGAN as well as for the first responders it served.

Police departments across the United States are relying on video/audio communication tools to ensure that citizens, businesses, and buildings are protected during these volatile times. The IGAN ICS video/audio platform provides first responders a critical real-time perspective during emergencies, giving immediate actionable information to all first responders and their emergency operations center incident commanders.

Texas Police Departments understand that in these difficult times, new technologies can drastically improve their ability to protect cities and their local citizens and communities, as well as provide ongoing safety, transparency, and accountability. Implementing the Cytta IGAN live-streaming video/audio communications platform allowed police to identify points of conflict that need attention when situations become overwhelming to officers with boots on the ground. The ability to live-stream video and audio feeds from phone cams, body cams, dash cams, and drones allows both police and their incident commanders to make better immediate decisions during emergencies.

“The IGAN communication platform was able to identify and monitor potential bad actors during a protest, allow the incident commanders to make immediate and informed decisions, and coordinate the information with their ground teams to ensure the safety of every protestor and first responder,” says Gary Campbell, CEO of Cytta Corp. “When first responders have accurate information at their fingertips, they can make better decisions, faster, improving response times and ensuring the safety and security of all involved.”

Texas Police Lieutenant Clay Regan, an integral part of the combined response team stated, ”In my 30+ years of Law Enforcement, and 26 years in the US Air Force, I have seldom witnessed an advancement in technology with this potential. At full capacity, and with all IGAN systems in play, this product has the capacity to rival any significant innovation for police, fire, emergency management, or public safety in general.”

Situational awareness is accomplished for first responders when drones, and all other video/audio data feeds are connected to incident commanders through IGAN. This provides real-time intelligence of a situation by de-escalating potential conflict before it results in the loss of life or damaged property.

258,How do you know when to sell?,"Newbie here. I bought into the stock market when it crashed back in March. I now have a couple of stocks that have yielded a 100% return (ZM, TTD, and INO). I’ve heard different things about selling when you hit the 100% mark. I don’t want to miss out on future earnings, but also don’t want to get greedy and have them go down a bunch. That already is happening with INO. What’s your advice?",2020-07-02 10:20:12
259,ZM - How it Compares by Market Cap,"As of today (July 02/2020) - Zoom Video Communications Technologies has the following stats:

P/E Ratio: 1505.69 

EPS: 0.18

Employees: 2.5K

Share Price: $261 USD

YTD Growth: 285% Gain

Now it doesn’t take a master stock picker to find some serious red flags. But for fun - let’s compare ZM with some other major companies with smaller market caps in the same industry.

Uber:
Market Cap: $53B

Spotify:

For anyone long Sea Limited (SE), Shopee, their ecommerce app, was the second most downloaded shopping app in the world for May (30% of downloads from Indonesia, 20% in Brazil). Garena Free Fire, their flagship mobile game, was the 3rd most downloaded game in the world for April and May.

Zoom was the most downloaded app in the world for the month of April, and the second most downloaded for the month of May. Also, over 80% of Zoom downloads coming from outside the United States. India actually had more downloads than the U.S. over that period.

262,COVID DEATHS VS THE MARKET,"As a new investor I would like to get some opinions from some of the savvy folks out there. 

I recently pulled about half of my money out of the stock market as COVID cases started increasing in America. I know that the death rate will start to dramatically increase in a week or two as a result. With the increased death rate I'm expecting the market to take a negative turn and hence why I pulled half my money out. 

Am I getting cold feet or am I right to take this precautionary approach? Planning on buying during the dip (if there is one).

Currently still invested in MFST, AMD and ZM but sold on BABA (..fuck me), DIS, CRNC, SNPS and ALB.",2020-07-08 22:29:26
263,Stock valuations compared to the past,"The valuation of my portfolio is reaching a price to sales ratio of 50. $ZM ist approaching a P/S of 100.  
 I'm glad I'm more than 100 percent up for the year, but WTH is the market expecting from these stocks?  

For instance if you bought $AMZN back in 2006 and held it till now you would've hit an absolute home run of an investment. The company performance was more than stellar, it executed like you couldn't have expected in your wildest dreams.  
Yet if you bought $AMZN back in 2006 at a PS ratio of 50, you would have barely doubled your value by now, scoring underwhelming 3,5% a year gain and that is including the current valuation craze.  

Do people really believe companies like $SHOP or $ZM will perform vastly better than Amazon did in the last 14 years?",2020-07-09 04:00:24
264,I am going to build a near real-time stock news database/API. Collecting YOUR feature requests,"Hey algotraders, 

&#x200B;

You might already know me for pygooglenews and newscatcher Python packages.

&#x200B;

I am going to build a financial (NYSE/NASDAQ) tickers news API. I will read each and every comment here, so do not hesitate to leave your detailed request. 

&#x200B;

I saw a lot of demand for financial news API while working for NewsCatcherAPI. NewsCatcherAPI is not well fitted for this purpose so I decided to make it a separate more advanced product for it. 

&#x200B;

I went through almost all the posts here that talk about stock news APIs. Foud some interesting opinions (and 0 people saying they use such data for algotrading, lol)

&#x200B;

But still, many corporate clients come to me from financial/trading background (some of those are 10m+ capitalization firms)

&#x200B;

# What I am actually planning to do

1. First of all, I already have access to 350-500k news articles per day (because of NewsCatcher). And generally, I've been working with collecting news data for more than a year, so I know a lot of hidden pitfalls already. That's experience, came with time.
2. Each English article I will scan for mention of any company from NYSE/NASDAQ. I already have some basic dataset with ticker + official company name + most used company name (ZM + Zoom Video Communications, Inc. + Zoom). **But if you have such one or know where I could get/scrape it, please let me know**
3. If article mentions at least one company it ends up in our database. 
4. I count how many times each stock gets mentioned in this article.
5. I get all the basic data (text sentiment, published DateTime, title, text, URL, etc)
6. Trying to catch important news: the company won a gov contract. company is buying another company. M&A. **What else should I be looking for here?**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Questions to the community:

1. Anyone here ACTUALLY using news data feeds for algotrading?
2. How much of a delay from news being published to it being available in API is OK (ASAP I understand)
3. What to search for in the news headlines/text: contracts, acquisition, etc
4. List of all companies with alternative names? 
5. What else would you need and why?

&#x200B;

Any personal questions or waitlist: DM me.",2020-07-09 09:12:02

267,Thoughts on 50% ZM / 50% GLD,"I came up with this idea while meditating like my mentor Ray Dalio always advocated doing. My philosophy behind this portfolio is that ZM is the stock of the future. It represents the post-Corona world where WFH becomes the new norm and tech dominates. On the other hand, gold is the link to the past - the keeper of value and eternal stabilizer. Together, I don't see how this portfolio could return less than the S&P 500, and it most likely would do so with much less risk.

270,"Tesla Hit a New High. No, It Was TLSA. Confused?","Tesla stock hit a new high before closing down. The problem is it didn’t. It was a stock that resembles Tesla, the electric-vehicle pioneer. Investors appeared to be confused by near-identical stock tickers: TSLA and TLSA.

The stock in question is TLSA, or Tiziana Life Sciences ￼, and investors sent it to an intraday record on Wednesday in apparent confusion with Tesla. Interestingly, its move over the past month is strikingly similar to the stock of Tesla (TSLA). Tiziana stock is up 47% over the past month. Tesla shares are up 56%. What’s more, Tiziana shares are up 219% year to date, while Tesla shares have gained 270%.

Tiziana is a biotech company with no sales and one analyst covering the company, according to Bloomberg. At the beginning of the year, the stock had a market value of less than $75 million.

Google can’t even seem to differentiate the two companies. Tiziana has been doing things in 2020, such as announcing partnerships for Covid-related therapeutics. But if you seek general information on the company, typing “TLSA stock” into Google, or “TLSA investor relations,” brings up Tesla information.

Zoom Technologies ￼ (ZTNO) stock took a ride in the wake of the Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM) initial public offering. Eventually the SEC suspended trading in Zoom Technologies because of confusion. Shares were at $10.40 before the suspension. They opened weeks later at 30 cents before closing at $2.25. Shares closed at 37 cents Wednesday.

Zoom Technologies has no sales or analysts. Its market capitalization is only about $1 million.

It might seem like it goes without saying, but it doesn’t. Check stock symbols twice before trading.

Gap Ups: AA, ACIU, DELL, EBON, LGHL, LIN, 

Gap Downs: ACMR, BABA, BILI, GSX, PDD, ZM

Market gapping down. Choppy action the past few weeks. Most likely a combination of summer trading, lack of true catalysts in the market and most stocks being extremely oversold. Many tech names have slightly pulled back but could honestly use more after the extreme moves they made in the past month or so. I am always more patient in this type of market, the lack of opening volume on most days recently is a bit more difficult to trade due to large spreads so I wait until I see the best moves and for the market to establish direction. If I don't see anything I like I simply will not trade. As always before you enter trades it is a good idea to have stops and targets calculated before entering any trade. This helps eliminate emotional trading. Good luck out there.

Average return: 55%  
Average return on ""new tech"": 6%  
Average return on ""efficient tech"": 81%  

My comments:  
I definitely did not expect the stocks would be this high after just one year. There is a clear divide between the ""new tech"" and the ""efficient tech"" type of companies though: the latter stocks expanded in valuations by a lot. The price to sales on some of them doubled. I'd approach these with caution - the market seems to be a little too exstatic about them, but on the other hand it seems like capital has nowhere else to go so I can't imagine the market abandoning the valuations anytime soon. 

On the other hand the ""new tech"" stocks moved largerly side-ways with two outliers - HXL running into Covid19 trouble as an aerospace supplier and VRTX posting impressive earnings and continuing to execute well on their plan. All in all the valuations of these companies remained sensible in contrast to the ""efficient stocks"". While these should be the higher risk stocks, they seem now like a more reasonable investment.

284,ZM run-up to earnings--get in soon,"I wish I would have played this last time I noticed the trend but wanted to share with ya'll what I've been seeing with ZM over the past month (which is an eternity in WSB casino world). Now I know technical is all BS yada yada but since the end of June ZM has been pretty choppy...yet it has consistent support/resistance levels. Since June 29 ZM has held support in the mid to low 240's five times...the fifth time being today reaching a low of $246 before closing the day at $250. 

Following these support levels ZM has driven up to its resistance level which seems to be $270ish (reached $276 in mid-July). And it rises pretty quickly. Not FD weekly quickly, but usually within two weeks (hence my current calls 8/21). If I wasn't still way over-leveraged in SLV and PLTN I'd be going in more...might still end up doing it anyway. 

The other thing going for ZM right now is earnings on Aug 31, so a run-up before then is likely. Based on this there is a chance it extends past $270 (and who knows after earnings) so I wouldn't recommend calls way OTM, but $270 or less should bring you in some through the rest of the month.

290,Agora $API Write-Up: Hypergrowth Chinese Twilio,"A simple way to describe Agora is it’s like a Chinese Twilio focused on video, and more specifically live streaming (which Twilio does not do). Although many are understandably hesitant about Chinese companies, my confidence is a bit higher in this one given founder and CEO Tony Zhao’s history of working in the US (he was a founding engineer at WebEx), that Agora has dual headquarters in China and the US and only expanded to China a year after it was founded, their impressive customer list with giants like Xiaomi and ByteDance, and some famous investors like Coatue that reportedly decided to invest after just two weeks.

I’ve written a deep dive on it on my Substack where I provide an overview of its platform, customers, competition, market opportunity, financials, and risks. I'm long Agora in my personal portfolio and it's a company I'm really excited about as it has most of the criteria I look for in a potential multi-bagger: hypergrowth, category leader with a defensible moat, large and fast-growing TAM with high optionality, small market cap (under $5B), strong margins, and visionary management (Tony pioneered Real-Time Engagement).

My Agora thesis also ties in with the future I see for Twilio and Zoom, and I go over it in the market opportunity section. Namely, I believe we will see the gradual commoditization of video which will lead to the unbundling of Zoom. Here’s a nice quote by JJ Oslund, whose article I reference: “Companies like Zoom that achieve massive growth and ubiquity lose one important competitive advantage: the ability to focus on a particular user… Zoom has become the lowest common denominator that works for everyone, yet it is not perfectly suited for anyone.”

ZM has already made significant inroads into education and telehealth but there is significant opportunity to chip away at their moat by focusing on serving specific user needs. The real competition isn’t WebEx, Meet, etc, it's the 250+ companies carving out their own verticals. “The endpoint for the verticalization of Zoom will be a no-code tool that gives users the power to design highly custom video apps for their particular needs.” And that's exactly what Agora is building.

The other part of my thesis, which may be of interest to Twilio owners, is that I believe some revolutionary businesses will be ideated in the current environment. Some of the greatest innovations came during periods of the greatest turmoil and with the advent of the API economy, companies like Twilio and Agora are well-positioned to help the new wave of start-ups, such as the ones that are competing against Zoom, scale up fast. In my opinion, the most exciting vertical for Twilio is healthcare. They became HIPAA compliant in February, and they've since seen more than a 100 percent increase in active healthcare customers using its video product. I think as traditional healthcare systems digitize then TWLO can do really well here even though this vertical is non-material to their growth right now. This plays into my TDOC thesis that I’ve outlined in previous blog posts.

Recently, the stocks that saw major selloffs post ER last ER release, notably, $CRM and $BOX, are seeing massive upticks. $WORK too was one of the stocks that had major run-ups but was followed by major selloffs post ER due to the lack of guidance despite beating analysts’ forecast.

I’m not here to assess the fundamentals of $WORK, but the bigger institutional investors are loading up on these bad boys probably for that same reason: It’s underpriced. I think you guys can safely get in this as it will see massive strides leading up to the ER.",2020-08-27 11:14:16
294,"How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%","I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",2020-08-27 21:58:08
295,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 31st, 2020","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 31st, 2020.

# **Stocks head into September in high gear as Apple and Tesla split, and markets await the August jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/stocks-start-september-in-high-gear-as-apple-and-tesla-split-and-markets-await-the-august-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> September is historically challenging for the market, but stocks could start the month on an upswing after what looks to be the best August for the S&P 500 in at least 34 years.
*****
> The week ahead will be busy with Fed speakers and economic reports, including the important August employment count Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 9 a.m. ET Monday on monetary policy. He is is one of several officials, who are expected to reiterate Chairman Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole message that the Fed would be willing to let inflation run hot temporarily to help the economy and job market.
*****
> The low volume days of late summer should be a hallmark of the week ahead, but there could also be window dressing trades around the month’s end, as investors rebalance holdings.
*****
> On Monday, there could be some excitement around two of the market’s favorite stocks. Apple begins trading after a 4-for-1 split. Tesla is also trading on a split-adjusted basis starting Monday, after it split its stock 5-for-1. Apple’s split changes its weight in the Dow, so the index is being adjusted and there will be new names in the index Monday as some old ones leave. ExxonMobil, Pfizer and Raytheon will be replaced by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 3.2% in the past week, and it could continue to make gains in the week ahead.
*****
> “I think we’re still going to be basking in the the glow of an accommodative Fed, combined with the increased accessibility of Apple’s share price to retail investors,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said that after its last split in 2014, Apple gained 36% over the next year, but after its 2000 split as the tech bubble burst, it lost 60%. Apple has risen more than 30% since announcing its stock split on July 30.
*****
> The S&P 500 was on track for a more than 6.9% gain in August, its best performance since 1986 if it holds that level through Monday. The S&P recovered and surpassed its all time high during the month and is now flirting with the psychological 3,500 area.
*****
> The S&P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said.
*****
> # Jobs, jobs, jobs
> Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%.
*****
> “I’m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,” said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic.
*****
> “What we’ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,” Markowska said. “At the same time, you’re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.”
*****
> Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there’s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.
*****
> “It strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,” he said.
*****
> Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart.
*****
> “We are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there’s no bridge for the next six months,” he said.
*****
> # Fed message
> After Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole symposium Thursday, Treasury yields moved in a wide range. The 10-year note was as low as 0.65% and as high as 0.78% Friday, before settling in at about 0.74% in afternoon trading Friday.
*****
> Powell said the Fed would be willing to let inflation rise a bit above 2% for awhile, and that it would now target an average without moving to tighten policy.
*****
> “The market reaction to Powell was a little confusing. I suspect the Fed did not want to see this back-up in nominal yields and I suspect they’ll push against it,” said Markowska.
*****
> Fed watchers said the message from Powell was that the Fed will likely keep rates lower for a longer period. Bond strategists said the market was responding to the idea of higher inflation, and rates were rising, particularly at the long end of the curve.

> # S&P 500 Stocks: Worlds Apart

> If you've been paying attention this year, you know that the S&P 500 has been carried by the performance of the index's largest components, and the chart below illustrates just how wide the disparity has been. It shows the YTD performance of each of the S&P 500's members sorted by their market cap heading into 2020 with the largest stocks on the left side and the smallest stocks on the right. So far this year, the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.3% YTD, and if we were to take an even narrower look at just the ten largest stocks heading into the year, the average YTD gain is over 27%!

> While the largest stocks are up a lot this year, the next 400 stocks in terms of market cap haven't fared nearly as well, averaging a decline of 2.0%. That's not great, but considering the pandemic this year, even a 2% decline isn't such a bad thing. The same can't be said for the smallest stocks in the S&P, however. As shown below, the 50 smallest stocks are down an average of 15.3% YTD, and more than two-thirds of them are down!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827-Individual-stocks.png))**

> Another way to illustrate the declining fortunes of stocks this year based on their size is by looking at a moving average of YTD stock performance across the market cap spectrum, In the chart below, the first point on the chart represents the performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 which have gained an average of 11.3% YTD. The next point to the right represents the average YTD change of the stocks that ranked between number 2 and 51 in terms of market cap at the start of 2020, and we continue that process down the entire list of components to the point where the last point in the series on the right side of the chart represents the average performance of the 50 smallest stocks in the S&P 500 heading into the year. As mentioned above, that group of stocks has averaged a decline of 15.3% YTD. The performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 ranks as the fourth-best of 451 different points on the chart, while the basket of the 50 smallest stocks ranks as the 29th worst performing basket. In 2020, the bigger the stock, the better the returns.

> # Which Bull Will It Be?

> The incredible rally off the March 23 bear market bottom continues, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 50% from those fateful lows. It feels like a lifetime since the longest bull market ever ended. Remember though, although the recent bull market was the longest, it wasn’t the greatest, as the 1990s bull gained more on a percentage basis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We discussed in detail what the new highs in the S&P 500 meant here, so we won’t dive into that again. But this time we’ll show just how this rally ranks versus others that ended major bear markets. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this new bull market, up to this point of about five months, is stronger than any other major bull market’s start going back to World War II.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Yes, this new bull market is the strongest bull market we’ve ever seen after five months,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But that shouldn’t be a source of worry. The previous two strongest rallies up to this point were in 1982 and 2009, and both saw continued strength during the first year of the new bull market.”

> Here is a chart showing just this bull market and the ’82 and ’09 bull markets.

> # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

> Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

> Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",2020-08-28 17:18:45
296,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 31st, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 31st, 2020.

# **Stocks head into September in high gear as Apple and Tesla split, and markets await the August jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/stocks-start-september-in-high-gear-as-apple-and-tesla-split-and-markets-await-the-august-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> September is historically challenging for the market, but stocks could start the month on an upswing after what looks to be the best August for the S&P 500 in at least 34 years.
*****
> The week ahead will be busy with Fed speakers and economic reports, including the important August employment count Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 9 a.m. ET Monday on monetary policy. He is is one of several officials, who are expected to reiterate Chairman Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole message that the Fed would be willing to let inflation run hot temporarily to help the economy and job market.
*****
> The low volume days of late summer should be a hallmark of the week ahead, but there could also be window dressing trades around the month’s end, as investors rebalance holdings.
*****
> On Monday, there could be some excitement around two of the market’s favorite stocks. Apple begins trading after a 4-for-1 split. Tesla is also trading on a split-adjusted basis starting Monday, after it split its stock 5-for-1. Apple’s split changes its weight in the Dow, so the index is being adjusted and there will be new names in the index Monday as some old ones leave. ExxonMobil, Pfizer and Raytheon will be replaced by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 3.2% in the past week, and it could continue to make gains in the week ahead.
*****
> “I think we’re still going to be basking in the the glow of an accommodative Fed, combined with the increased accessibility of Apple’s share price to retail investors,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said that after its last split in 2014, Apple gained 36% over the next year, but after its 2000 split as the tech bubble burst, it lost 60%. Apple has risen more than 30% since announcing its stock split on July 30.
*****
> The S&P 500 was on track for a more than 6.9% gain in August, its best performance since 1986 if it holds that level through Monday. The S&P recovered and surpassed its all time high during the month and is now flirting with the psychological 3,500 area.
*****
> The S&P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said.
*****
> # Jobs, jobs, jobs
> Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%.
*****
> “I’m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,” said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic.
*****
> “What we’ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,” Markowska said. “At the same time, you’re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.”
*****
> Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there’s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.
*****
> “It strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,” he said.
*****
> Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart.
*****
> “We are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there’s no bridge for the next six months,” he said.
*****
> # Fed message
> After Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole symposium Thursday, Treasury yields moved in a wide range. The 10-year note was as low as 0.65% and as high as 0.78% Friday, before settling in at about 0.74% in afternoon trading Friday.
*****
> Powell said the Fed would be willing to let inflation rise a bit above 2% for awhile, and that it would now target an average without moving to tighten policy.
*****
> “The market reaction to Powell was a little confusing. I suspect the Fed did not want to see this back-up in nominal yields and I suspect they’ll push against it,” said Markowska.
*****
> Fed watchers said the message from Powell was that the Fed will likely keep rates lower for a longer period. Bond strategists said the market was responding to the idea of higher inflation, and rates were rising, particularly at the long end of the curve.

> # S&P 500 Stocks: Worlds Apart

> If you've been paying attention this year, you know that the S&P 500 has been carried by the performance of the index's largest components, and the chart below illustrates just how wide the disparity has been. It shows the YTD performance of each of the S&P 500's members sorted by their market cap heading into 2020 with the largest stocks on the left side and the smallest stocks on the right. So far this year, the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.3% YTD, and if we were to take an even narrower look at just the ten largest stocks heading into the year, the average YTD gain is over 27%!

> While the largest stocks are up a lot this year, the next 400 stocks in terms of market cap haven't fared nearly as well, averaging a decline of 2.0%. That's not great, but considering the pandemic this year, even a 2% decline isn't such a bad thing. The same can't be said for the smallest stocks in the S&P, however. As shown below, the 50 smallest stocks are down an average of 15.3% YTD, and more than two-thirds of them are down!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827-Individual-stocks.png))**

> Another way to illustrate the declining fortunes of stocks this year based on their size is by looking at a moving average of YTD stock performance across the market cap spectrum, In the chart below, the first point on the chart represents the performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 which have gained an average of 11.3% YTD. The next point to the right represents the average YTD change of the stocks that ranked between number 2 and 51 in terms of market cap at the start of 2020, and we continue that process down the entire list of components to the point where the last point in the series on the right side of the chart represents the average performance of the 50 smallest stocks in the S&P 500 heading into the year. As mentioned above, that group of stocks has averaged a decline of 15.3% YTD. The performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 ranks as the fourth-best of 451 different points on the chart, while the basket of the 50 smallest stocks ranks as the 29th worst performing basket. In 2020, the bigger the stock, the better the returns.

> # Which Bull Will It Be?

> The incredible rally off the March 23 bear market bottom continues, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 50% from those fateful lows. It feels like a lifetime since the longest bull market ever ended. Remember though, although the recent bull market was the longest, it wasn’t the greatest, as the 1990s bull gained more on a percentage basis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We discussed in detail what the new highs in the S&P 500 meant here, so we won’t dive into that again. But this time we’ll show just how this rally ranks versus others that ended major bear markets. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this new bull market, up to this point of about five months, is stronger than any other major bull market’s start going back to World War II.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Yes, this new bull market is the strongest bull market we’ve ever seen after five months,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But that shouldn’t be a source of worry. The previous two strongest rallies up to this point were in 1982 and 2009, and both saw continued strength during the first year of the new bull market.”

> Here is a chart showing just this bull market and the ’82 and ’09 bull markets.

> # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

> Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

> Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

300,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Monday, Aug 31!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 31**

Stocks closed out a month of incredible gains today, with major benchmarks experiencing their best August in decades. Investors are bolstered by an accommodative Federal Reserve, which has promised continued support of the economy, decreasing coronavirus infections, and rising hopes that a vaccine may soon be developed.

The S&P ended the day 0.24% down and the Dow ended 0.66% down. The NASDAQ outperformed ending the day 0.8% up, bolstered by a renewed tech rally.

The high-flying tech shares of Apple ($AAPL) and Tesla ($TSLA) both soared after their stocks split, both setting new record highs. Tech starts are once again rallying, carrying the broader market along with it. Despite the ongoing pandemic, the NASDAQ has been setting new records almost every session, thanks to tech stocks like Amazon ($AMZN), Facebook ($FB), Netflix ($NFLX), and Alphabet ($GOOG, $GOOGL).

Additionally, July’s high-frequency economic data broadly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates, the latest being robust personal income and spending data released on Friday. Taken together, economists now believe that third-quarter growth could be “even boomier” than prior estimates, JPMorgan Chase said on Friday. However, with unemployment levels still elevated, investors will be keeping a close on labor data in order to gauge the health of the market.

**Highlights**

* $UTZ Pennsylvania-based chip and pretzel brand, has gone public as today. The Utz merged with SPAC Collier Creek Holdings to form a public company. Stock is up 12.1% today
* $AMD was up 6% today after breaking through $87.5 resistance. Stock trading at $90.6
* JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa turned more negative on ($GE) prospects, withdrawing his price target and estimating fair value at less than $5. The firm still rates GE with a neutral recommendation but says ""we see little equity value here.""
* \-Workhorse ($WKHS) announcing a strategic agreement with Hitachi. Stock was up 10.5% today.
* Nestle ($NSRGY) announced it is acquiring Aimmune Therapeutics ($AIMT) to make a peanut allergy treatment approved by the FDA early in 2020. In addition to peanut allergies, Aimmune has therapies in its pipeline for the treatment of tree nut allergies.
* Microsoft ($MSFT) and Walmart ($WMT) fell after China's move to tighten technology export rules is making TikTok purchase difficult. New export restrictions covering such computing and data processing saying tech on the list can't be exported without local approval from govt
* Zoom ($ZM) reported earnings after session close.

QQQ gapping up pre market and tech stocks are gapping with it. SPY had a bit of a rest day yesterday but trading action within individual stocks was nice.  Lots of gappers pre market but the question is, do they hold their gaps or do they fade off? My plan is to trade these gappers primarily and focus on recent momentum plays in stocks with higher volume. Bullish outlook overall and as always keeping an eye on the market while I trade in case they try and pull the rug out from underneath us which happens from time to time when the market is overbought.

309,"Hey! Here is a Market Recap for today, Sept 1","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 1, 2020**

Stocks open September with the bang, as tech continued rallying and benchmarks ended in all-time highs. This is an encouraging start to what is usually a rough month for traders. Both the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq set new records on Tuesday, underpinned by the continuing rally in technology shares like Amazon ($AMZN), Microsoft ($MSFT), Zoom (ZM) Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) — the last two soared after their stocks split on Monday which helped boost market sentiment.

The S&P finished the day 0.97% up, the NASDAQ finished 1.8% up and the DOW finished 0.85% up. Great day for the markets overall!

Goldman Sachs ($GS) said, “while equities have never been as expensive since the Tech bubble, based on a 24-month (price/earnings basis), the equity risk premium is close to an all-time high, suggesting that equities have rarely been as attractive relative to bonds.” Moreover, July’s economic data in labor and manufacturing broadly overperformed Wall Street’s estimates suggesting the market could get even ‘boomier’, according to JP Morgan ($JPM).

Traders are encouraged by the Fed’s new policy, which promises economic support for as long as necessary, and declining numbers of Coronavirus cases in Southern states like Georgia and Florida, which recently became epicenters for the virus.

**Highlights**

* The ISM Manufacturing Index hitting its highest levels since August 2018.
* Piper Sandler lifted price target for $ZEN Zendesk Inc from $87 to $123

I felt like $ZM will kill the earnings after seeing some friends doing blind dates & weddings through $ZM, so threw some money in for $300C 9/11. Don't know much about TA, PE, or IV so I held through earnings.

313,Another 250% Option Play,"For starters I should acknowledge the fact that trading options is extremely risky, and you could lose 100% of your investment. It is especially dangerous if you aren't familiar with the intricate theory, and dialogue of options.   


My strategy isn't a fixed one, its constantly adapting to the ebbs and flows of market sentiments. Although I believe long term investing is the best way to grow wealth, day trading is a passion that will always be at the forefront of my mind, thus I do it every day and take it seriously.   
Now we all know that when a company posts good earnings in a certain sector, other companies in that certain sector can benefit. And sometimes it goes outside the sector, to more generic realms like, cloud space, financial services, or just stocks that have benefited to Covid. So when I see companies like Zoom, Shopify, or other Covid beneficiaries post good earnings, I look for other companies that could ride these coat tails. Now when it comes to the technical standpoint, the chart has to be in the right condition, and this is were I can judge whether it is worth the risk. Notable bull volume/ bull flags on the daily/hourly time frame, or healthy consolidation is key. If you're not educated on technical analysis I highly suggest putting in a solid effort to learning how to read and dissect charts. Stop-losses are used without question.

&#x200B;

**THIS WEEK;**

Chewy (CHWY) ; bought a $4.10/ 61.50 call for September 18th. Sold for 12.00   
\-This was an earnings play, based off the theory that ZM would push more of these ""Covid beneficiary"" stocks. Although they have nothing in common, pet sales sky-rocketed this spring, so online pet food sales were bound to follow.

SalesForce (CRM); bought a $5.90/270 call for September 11th. Sold for 14.30  
\-This was a momentum play, and one I do quite often. I had done a similar 300% trade last week, playing it off earnings. Healthy consolidation and bull volume keep this stock in a safe uptrend.

CrowdStrike (CRWD); I had bought two calls for this play, based on the pop Monday morning. Just like other Covid stocks, CRWD had momentum leading into its earnings date. Bought a $6.30/150 call for September 11th that I sold for $16.05. The other call is a long dated, out of the money, play that I will keep you updated on!  


I realize you yourself may not agree with the premise behind this analysis, but this strategy works for me, and has for a long time.

317,Zoom Crushes It by All Measures... Where Does It Go From Here?,"You know you've succeeded when your company name is used in place of a verb. Zoom ($ZM), the video conferencing tool, reported their quarterly earnings on Aug. 31 and exceeded all expectations.

* Revenue increased 355% from last year to $663.5m, 33% above market consensus.
* Net income increased over 13x from last year to $277m.
* International sales outside the Americas increased the fastest, over 7x from last year.

**How did Zoom get here?** The company had been a major beneficiary due to COVID but here's a couple things that helped Zoom become our go-to video chat service:

* **Strong brand awareness**... The company isn't afraid to splurge to build their brand. During COVID, Zoom [tripled](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/communication-software-brands-like-zoom-triple-ad-spending-under-coronaviru/575615/) their ad spend in the first quarter of 2020, while many other companies reduced their marketing budgets.
* **The company's product markets itself...** Even if you've never heard of Zoom, you become aware of their product once you join a Zoom call. It also helps that it's free for everyone to use.

**Where does Zoom go from here?** Even though the company's stock is up nearly 400% this year, Zoom has a couple more tricks up its sleeve:

* **Work from home boost**... More and more companies are opting to shift their workforce to work from home permanently. To further capitalize on this trend, on July 7, Zoom launched a hardware offering to sell and rent video conferencing equipment.
* **Growth beyond the US**... Sales in the Americas made up 68.4% of Zoom's total sales and it already holds [42.8%](https://learnbonds.com/news/top-3-us-web-conferencing-apps-hit-over-70-market-share/) of the US video conferencing market. International sales will be an important source of growth for Zoom.

For investors, the number one concern with Zoom is that the company is overpriced. According to NYU Stern School of Business, the average price-to-sales multiple of a US software business is [6-9x](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/psdata.html). This multiple is a commonly used metric to gauge whether a company is under or overpriced. The higher this number is, the more overpriced a stock becomes.

Investors have argued that Zoom is overpriced as it trades at a \~44x price-sales-multiple. Companies that are growing at a faster pace usually trade at a higher multiple. However, 44x seems a little high even compared to high rolling Tesla which trades at \~17x. Zoom will have to maintain a high growth rate to justify its high valuation, otherwise, its stock could fall.

Anyway, now looks like zoom might've actually expired worthless for me 😒 But now I have these options for next week... But no money since the credit was eaten up.

331,How to be Wrong and Still Make Money: A comprehensive guide to selling credit spreads,"So I first dipped my toes into options trading a few years ago. I had previously been swing trading stocks so I had a couple years of experience before that, but the leverage and potential returns that options provided really piqued my interest. After it was all said and done, I lost almost $20,000 buying options. After realizing that someone was getting all of this money I was losing, I learned about option selling and haven’t looked back since.

I recently posted my YTD performance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/i0mkv3/10k_to_100k_in_5_months_23k_in_deposits_and_67k/), and received a lot of questions about how I did it. My strategy changed over time, but I first started with credit spreads, which may be applicable to more people since it’s a strategy that works with smaller accounts too. I got a lot of questions about how I played credit spreads and it’s tough to completely explain what I do through a comment here and a comment there so I created this guide explaining my exact approach to trading credit spreads. Here you go:

This is a wall of text, so if you're a more visual learner, here's a link to videos explaining all four parts:

[Part One](https://youtu.be/J12HR1Ax2k0)

[Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1mlknat5qA)

[Part Three](https://youtu.be/Uu7_8856nZw)

[Part Four](https://youtu.be/2p5nlczCcFo)

#Part One: The Basics

So what is a spread? A high level conceptual explanation is that you’re essentially betting on a stock to finish above or below a certain price upon expiration. One of the advantages here is that you can set this number out of the money, so if a stock is trading at $100, you can bet that it’ll remain below $110 by a certain date. This is a bearish position, so if you’re correct and it goes down, you’ll make max profit. The catch though is that even if you’re wrong, you basically have a 10% upward cushion before you start to lose any money. So the easiest way to describe it is a strategy that lets you make money if you’re right, but also make money if you’re slightly off.

How does it work? So in the above example, if we were bearish on a stock we would open what’s called a call credit spread. We could set it up where we sell a 110c for a credit of $1.50, and buy a 115c for a debit of $0.50. This means that in this transaction we receive $1.50, and pay $0.50 for a net credit of $1. That credit is your max profit on the play. If you’re familiar with options you’ll know that if the stock finishes at or below $110 upon expiration, both of these calls will be worthless. That’s great news for us because the long leg we bought (115c) for 0.50 will be a loss, but we’ll get to keep the full $1.50 from the short leg (110c) that we sold, resulting in us realizing our max gain on the trade of $1.

Why not just sell the 110c and collect the full $1.50? While it cuts into our profits, the reason we buy the 115c in this example for $0.50 isn’t to cut into our profits when we’re correct, but rather protect us when we’re wrong. If the stock in the example stays below $110, we’re good to go and we’ll hit max profit. But what if it goes to $120, $150, or something crazy happens and it hits $200. If the stock hits $150 upon expiration, that 110c that we sold for $1.50 will be worth $40, meaning that we’ll incur a $3,875 loss in pursuit of a $150 gain. We’ve seen crazy run ups from the likes of TSLA and ZM lately, and people who sold what we call “naked options” got absolutely killed. With our spread, yes our 110c will be worth $40 meaning we’re down $4,000 on that position, but the 115c we bought behind it will be worth $35 meaning we’re up $3,500 there for a net loss of $500. Additionally, we get to keep that $1.00 credit we received up front no matter what, so our loss with this spread is actually $500-$100=$400 as opposed to the $3,875 loss that we would’ve seen had we sold the 110c by itself. THAT is the value in selling a spread as opposed to a naked option.

Why are you multiplying everything by 100? Each options contract is worth 100 shares, so a contract that is trading for $1.50 actually costs $150 to purchase.

Another high level point I like to make is that there are really 5 different things that can happen when you make a play. Let’s say you think a stock will go up. It can (1) go up a ton and you’d be correct, (2) go up a little and you’d be correct, (3) trade flat and you’d be incorrect, (4), go down a little and you’d be incorrect, or (5) go down a lot and you’d be incorrect. With a bullish spread, you’d hit max profit on 4/5 , or 80% of the possible outcomes, whereas if you bought stock or purchased an option you’d only be profitable on (1) or (2). Obviously the actual outcomes are a little more complex, but for a base-level understanding of the advantages a spread provides, I think this is a good way to look at it.

So that’s the value of a spread. A lot of traders are introduced to option selling and are scared of the prospect of incurring a huge loss like we mentioned above, but using credit spreads is a great way of receiving the benefits that selling has to offer while limiting a lot of the risks. So let’s move onto actually opening a spread.


#Part Two: Making the Trade
So for actually opening a spread up, we have a four-step approach we take: Pick a Stock Pick a Direction Pick a Strike Price Execute the Trade

**1: Picking a Stock:**

One of the most important things I tell people is to trade what you know. I have a watchlist of 25-30 stocks that I watch and get familiar with during the day. That way if I recognize a good opportunity, I’ll have a decent base of knowledge to rely on to make what I feel is a smart play. It’s super easy to get caught up in the “stock of the week” and try to jump in on a play because a ticker is in the news. If you’re not familiar with a stock, don’t trade it.

For this example (the one used in the video), Wayfair was trading in a 195-210 range for a little bit and then had a big day where it broke up out of that range and up towards $220. This was an unusual move that I noticed since it was on my watchlist, so I decided to make a play.

STOCK: WAYFAIR

**2: Picking a direction:**

So if we look at Wayfair’s YTD chart, it has exploded this year. A clear upward trend, but a recent trend that I noticed from following the stock was that every time it broke out like this, there would be a little bit of a pullback afterwards. Additionally, I felt the stock was overvalued on a fundamental basis (had a negative book value at the time of the trade) so I wanted to play this stock back down. This is probably the quickest and easiest step of the four, since you’ll likely already have an opinion on most of the stocks that you follow.

DIRECTION: DOWN

**3:Picking a Strike Price:**

So we know that we’re going to be playing Wayfair back down, but now the question is what spread are we going to set up to do that. In this example Wayfair was trading at $218.42 at the time that we decided to make this trade. In the video we illustrate a trading channel that Wayfair was at the top of. It was also approaching the ATH of $221.54. A lot of the time that will act as resistance for a stock, meaning it’ll bounce down off of it. So in order to give ourselves a bit of a cushion we decided to set our short leg at 222.50, meaning that we’re playing the stock to stay below $222.50 by the end of that week.

So with this play it means in plain English that if we’re correct and the stock goes down, we hit max profit. But if we’re wrong and it goes up, we still have a $4.08 cushion before we’re not hitting max profit anymore. So we could be a little wrong, have the stock go up a few dollars, and still walk away with max profit.

STRIKE PRICE OF SHORT LEG: $222.50

**4: Executing the Trade:**

I’ll be the first to tell you that when I started trading spreads I didn’t realize you could open both legs of the spread at once. I was stupid. I would like to think I’m at least a little bit smarter now. If you look at the options screen for most brokers, you’ll just see single legs. Switching over to “vertical” allows you to set up the entire spread in one trade. If you use something like RH, there’s a feature that allows you to select multiple options, so you’ll select the one you wish to sell (short leg) and the one you wish to buy (long leg).

In this example we selected the 222.5/227.5c spread, meaning that we sold the short leg of 222.5 and the long leg of 227.5. The net credit was 1.45, which is our max gain on the trade. A wider spread gives a larger credit but also increases max loss. This is a $5 wide spread but we could have made it a tighter spread with a $2.5 width. Typically the best risk to reward ratio is on the tightest spreads, but a slightly wider spread will raise your breakeven price and studies have shown that it actually results in better expected value long term.

Circling back to the credit we received of $1.45, this means that our max profit was $145 and our max loss was $355 for each spread that we sold. We know that because our broker tells us that, but a quick way to calculate it is the width of the spread minus the credit. A $1.45 credit on $5 wide spread means a $5-$1.45=$3.55 max loss.

When I evaluate trades like this I look for a max profit to max loss ratio of 1:2 to 1:4. Based on different scanners I’ve seen, the best expected values tend to fall on spreads within that risk/reward ratio. The ratio on this trade is 1:2.44.

So we put our order in for a credit of $1.45, it filled, and now we get to sit back and watch. Sometimes your order won’t fill right away. In fact, most of the time it won’t fill right away. It’s important to be patient with your fill price and not chase it downwards. We want the highest credit possible. So if the credit on these spreads dropped to 1.30 when I was trying to place an order, it usually isn’t a great idea to drop my order price down to 1.30 just to get a fill. The only time I would recommend that is if you’re trying to open a spread right before the market closes. Otherwise, hang tight. Patience pays.

#Part 3: Managing the Trade

So now that we’ve made the trade, it’s time to manage it. In my opinion one of the best parts about trading spreads is that they don’t require active management. You get to sit back and watch the price. Once the trade has been opened, which is also quick, it takes very little effort.

So with the Wayfair example we used, our analysis turned out perfectly, as Wayfair touched the ATH and dipped back down to end the week safely at $214. We hit max profit on that trade, but what if the trade goes against us? That’s what we’ll take a look at in this section.

One thing we didn’t address in part two is when to open the trade. We like opening spreads on Mondays and Tuesdays, and monitoring them during the week. This is the part of my strategy that is a little bit controversial, as there is a (legitimate) school of thought that selling spreads about 45 DTE is better value. I like that idea and if you would rather do that then absolutely go for it. It’s important to trade what you’re comfortable with. All of the lessons in here still apply to that strategy. With that said though, I stick with the weekly strategy of opening them at the beginning of the week and look to close them throughout the week.

The way I see it, your % of max profit should be the metric you’re looking at when deciding what to do with a spread. Divided up equally, that means if you progressed through the week to max profit in a linear fashion, you would be at 20% of max profit on Monday, 40% on Tuesday, and so forth. A good rule of thumb I use is that if you’re ever on the fence about whether or not to close something out, do so if your return exceeds the linear return for that day of the week. The market can move quickly and I’ve had several times where I have regretted not closing a spread out. It’s important to take profit.

Another thing I’ll add to this is that this weekly strategy gets a little risky on Thursday afternoon headed into Friday. If your spread is remotely close to being in the money on Thursday afternoon, close it out. Now that I type that out I realize that may all sound a little convoluted, but it’s better visualized in the video I’ve linked for this section.

Now let's get into what happens if a trade really starts to move against you. With the strategy we use there are really two options: (1) Close the trade for a loss and move on, or (2) Roll the strikes higher.

The first option is pretty self explanatory, but a quick note I want to add here is that you can have a stock move way against you but still be able to close the trade for less than max loss. The example I use in my video is I played FB earnings, thought it would go down, but it shot way above my spread and well into max loss territory. We opened a 245/247.5c spread for a credit of $0.54. FB was reporting earnings on a Thursday night and we sold this spread that expired the following day, so there wasn’t a ton of time to manage it. Long story short, FB killed earnings and shot up to $256 that morning. Really not a prayer that it would come back down to the spread I opened by the end of the day. But despite the fact that this trade went way against us and we had almost no time to manage it since it was a Friday play, we were still able to close out for a debit of $1.90. Yes that’s a loss of $1.36 per spread, but we SAVED an additional $0.60 cent loss by avoiding a max loss debit of $2.50. That’s another benefit of spreads.

Let’s talk about option two. This is the best option to use if you’re confident that you’re correct about the ultimate price action on a stock, but you need a little extra wiggle room on the trade. For this example we’ll look at a TSLA call spread that I opened. TSLA was trading at $1542 after an incredible run, so I figured I would play it below 1600 with a 1600/1610c spread that offered a credit of $2.52. As is the theme with this section, TSLA exploded the following morning (Tuesday) and went all the way up to $1794 at one point. My spread was literally almost $200 out of the money. One of the biggest possible moves against myself that I had ever seen. Despite this crazy move, it was only Tuesday and we were able to close the first spread for a debit of only $5.25 (as opposed to a $10 max debit). We opened 6 of these off the bat so this was a loss of $1638. From there we “rolled” our strikes higher, opening 10 1750/1760c spreads for a credit of $3.45. So the closing and subsequent opening of a spread like we did here is what we are referring to when we say we “rolled the strikes higher”.

By the end of the week TSLA had finally crashed a bit and it finished at $1506. This meant the second of spreads we opened were easily max profit. And while we lost $1,638 on the first set of spreads we opened here, we profited $3,450 on the second set of spreads so we were able to still finish the week with a $1,812 profit on TSLA. The funny thing with this one is that the original spread would have hit max profit since it dropped all the way back down to 1500, but we would have had the same result had TSLA finished anywhere below 1750.

Rolling the strikes higher gave me extra breathing room and turned a potential disaster into a profitable trade. One thing I’ll add though is that with this method you do run the risk of increasing your potential max loss. Because of that, I’ll only roll my strikes higher ONCE. Anything past that is chasing a losing trade. If I roll my strikes higher and it’s still going against me, I’m at the point where I need to accept the fact that I don’t fundamentally understand a stock as well as I thought I did and move on. There is always another trade out there.

The final point I’ll add to this is ALWAYS CLOSE OUT YOUR SPREADS. The only time I’ll let a spread expire worthless is if my spread is OTM by a crazy amount and it would quite literally take a historic after-hours move on Friday to take me back ITM. Other than that, close your spreads out. Even if it’s just for a $0.05 debit. It may seem annoying but I’ll tell you why in the following section.

#Part 4: Additional Risks and Considerations

I will start this section by saying I’ve never been impacted by any of the following risks, but it’s important to be aware of 100% of the possible outcomes of your trade before you enter it. They’re infrequent but this really wouldn’t be a comprehensive guide if I omitted them. They are as follows: (1) Early Assignment, (2) Dividend Risk, (3) Pin Risk.

**1: Early Assignment:**

The best way to start this section is by talking about why your max loss is actually your max loss. We know it’s quickly calculated as the width of your spread minus the credit, but why is that?

Let’s use a 110/115c spread as an example. We’ll say we received a credit of $1. We know that if the stock finishes anywhere below 110 then both legs are worthless and we’ll hold onto that $1 credit. But what happens if we’re in a max loss position. Let’s say the stock finishes at $120.

In this situation the short leg (110c) we sold would be worth $10 (120-110), meaning that we would owe $1,000 on that position. The long leg we bought would be worth $5 (120-115), meaning we are holding a position worth $500. The net effect is a $500 loss, but remember that’s netted against the $100 credit you received, so it’s a max loss of $400. That math checks out as the width of the spread is $5, the credit is $1, so the max loss is 5-1=$4*100=$400.

So that’s how it works upon expiration. But lets say this position moved against you, you still have a few days until expiration, but the stock is at $120. Since there are a few days left, you probably could close the contract for a debit of $3.50 rather than the max loss debit of $5. However, since your short leg is ITM the person you sold the option to may choose to exercise their option. As a result, that would require you to take on a short position of $110*100=$11,000 per contract sold. You may not be able to afford to cover that, or your broker may not let you hold that position. So what happens is your long leg gets exercised as well resulting in you taking a max loss early. So while on paper you received a credit of $1 that could have been closed for a debit of $3.50 and your loss was only $2.50, early assignment results in you prematurely taking a max loss.

When does this happen? It typically doesn’t, since it requires the buyer sacrificing the remaining extrinsic value on the option, but it’s more likely with certain stocks. There are three different classifications of a stock that relate to it’s borrowing ability: Easy to Borrow (ETB), Hard to Borrow (HTB), and Not Available to Borrow (NTB). The harder a stock is to borrow, the more likely it is that a call is exercised early because it gives the buyer a way to acquire a stock which may not be available to them through their broker. So if you’re selling call spreads that are close to being ITM, make sure to check out the borrowing status of the stock.

**2: Dividend Risk:**

This risk relates to the first one discussed, as it’s just another way you risk early assignment. If a company is announcing a dividend, there will be something known as an “ex-div” date, which means that all shareholders as of that date are entitled to receive the divident, which will be distributed usually at a later date. Because of this, call buyers may exercise an out of the money call option in an effort to acquire those shares.

Remembering that exercising an option means that you sacrifice all remaining extrinsic value, another reason a buyer may exercise a call option before an ex-dividend date is that the value of the dividend announced is greater than the extrinsic value remaining in the option. Say a 100c is trading at $2 and the underlying (stock) is currently at 101. The extrinsic value is the value of the option in excess of what it would be worth upon expiration. So the extrinsic value in this situation is $1, since the 100c trading for $2 is just $1 in excess of the current strike price. If the company in question here announced a $2 dividend, an option buyer would likely exercise their call option because the $2 dividend is greater than the $1 of extrinsic value.

**3: Pin Risk:**

We know that if your spread finishes out of the money it’s a max gain and if both legs of your spread finish in the money it’s a max loss. But what happens when the price of a stock finishes between the two legs of your spread? Let’s take a look.

So using a 100/110c spread as an example, let’s say that the stock finishes at 105. Your long leg, which is there to protect you, is worthless so you wouldn’t exercise it. However the short leg at 100 that you sold will be exercised by the buyer since it’s ITM. As a result, you’re now short 100 shares at a price of 100 and you’ll be holding that position over the weekend. This can go both ways from here, but since we’re focused on risk let’s say that this stock you’re now short shoots up over the weekend and some sort of news/event brings it up to $120.

With this short position of 100 shares at $100 you’re borrowing $10,000 worth of stock. Now that the stock is worth $120 this position is now worth $12,000. Over the weekend you’ve sustained a $2,000 loss. If we received a credit of $3 when we opened this spread, we may have thought that our max loss was 10-3=$7*100=$700. Since we failed to close the spread out, this position has now resulted in a $2,000 loss net of the $300 credit that you received when you opened the position. So on a trade where you thought you could lose at most $700, you’re now down almost $2k.

I can’t repeat it enough, but THIS IS WHY WE CLOSE OUT SPREADS BEFORE EXPIRATION. That is the single most important takeaway I can give you here. Spreads are great since they’re defined risk and defined gain. When you’re buying options you have a defined loss but a potentially infinite gain. This can make it really easy to get greedy and I’ve seen countless traders lose big profits because they keep holding out for more. When you have a defined gain and defined loss it makes it easier to make smart decisions, take profits, and continuously build on those profits over time.

That was an enormous wall of text but I hope it helps explain, from a base level, what spreads are and how they work. Switching from buying options to selling options has dramatically changed my performance in the market so I hope sharing this can do the same for someone else. If you have any questions let me know and I’d be happy to answer them.",2020-09-16 15:46:57

Caught a nice bounce in SPY off of support via the 50 day MA on the daily. Pre market pretty flat with the SPY and QQQ  both trying to hold support on the daily charts. Ideally we would like to see these areas of support on the daily charts hold/base and then move higher, so far so good but I won't be fully convinced this is just a dip until we break back over our short term moving averages, until then I keep an open mind as to direction and will be taking long and short positions while we are in this small range. May be a good day to run a scan after the open since the pre market is flat. It is likely that we see some follow through on some of the plays from yesterday but since it's Friday and the market is caught up in these moving averages it could be an inside sort of choppy day. Either way, there will always be plays, we just have to find them. Enjoy your weekend. I'll see you all Monday. Good luck out there

336,Trump says he has agreed to deal in which TikTok will partner with Oracle and Walmart,"President Donald Trump said Saturday he has approved in principle a deal in which [Oracle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=ORCL) and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) would partner with the viral video-sharing app TikTok in the U.S., allowing the popular app to [avoid a shutdown](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/trump-to-block-us-downloads-of-tiktok-wechat-on-sunday-officials-tell-reuters.html).

“I have given the deal my blessing -- if they get it done that’s great, if they don’t that’s okay too,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn before departing for North Carolina . “I approved the deal in concept.”

Trump said the new company will likely be incorporated in Texas. 

Oracle, Walmart and Tiktok could not be immediately reached for comment. 

The outcome could boost Oracle’s position as a company that can handle challenging computing workloads and help to resolve a geopolitical dispute between the U.S. and China.

TikTok and Oracle [both said Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/oracle-confirms-deal-with-tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-become-trusted-technology-provider.html) that ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, had sent a proposal to the U.S. Treasury Department over the weekend. Reports throughout the week said that negotiations were bogged down on the precise details of the deal, including the ownership stakes of Oracle and ByteDance, and control of the recommendation algorithms TikTok uses to promote particular material. 

Oracle CEO Safra Catz was a member of President Trump’s transition team, and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison threw a fundraising event for Trump earlier this year.

Oracle already provides cloud infrastructure to online video services [8x8](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=EGHT) and [Zoom](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=ZM), among other clients, although [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN), Microsoft and other companies picked up more cloud revenue than Oracle in 2019, according to [estimates](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-10-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-37-point-3-percent-in-2019) from industry research company [Gartner](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=IT).

[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT) had sought to acquire TikTok’s operations in the U.S. Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) as a partner, but on Sunday said [ByteDance had decided not to do that deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/microsoft-bid-for-tiktoks-us-operations-rejected-by-bytedance.html).

China and the Trump administration have used tariffs in their trade war in recent years, and their disagreements have spilled over into the technology industry. The Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States [pushed for a sale](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/grindrs-chinese-owner-says-to-sell-social-media-app-for-608-million.html) of dating app Grindr by the Chinese company that bought it in 2016, and the committee later [looked into ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/29/mnuchin-confirms-tiktok-is-under-cfius-review.html) of Musical.ly, a video sharing app that ByteDance merged with TikTok in 2018, because of national security concerns. A Trump executive order in August in August sought to [block U.S. transactions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/trump-issues-executive-orders-to-ban-us-transactions-with-wechat-tiktok.html) with ByteDance, as well as [Tencent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=700-HK), which owns messaging app WeChat.

President Trump had taken steps to [ban TikTok in the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/trump-says-he-will-ban-tiktok-through-executive-action-as-soon-as-saturday.html) or make ByteDance [sell the app’s U.S. assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/president-trump-orders-bytedance-to-divest-from-its-us-tiktok-business-within-90-days.html). The Chinese government subsequently revised export restrictions so that they now cover “recommendation of personalized information services based on data analysis,” among other things. TikTok’s app draws on recommendation systems to select videos to show each user.

344,"Stock Watch List September 24, 2020","**Good morning, here's my gap watch list:**

**Gap Ups:** DRI, JEF, NETE, OMI, SSP, SUNW, UVXY

**Gap Downs**: ACN, DKNG, DPHC, KC, LCO, NIO, NKLA, PDD, PENN, PTON, SHLL, SNOW, TSLA, ZM

**Outlook/Game Plan:** I had mentioned yesterday that we may find some resistance now that we were underneath our moving averages and we found it. SPY hit the 9 ema and continued it's trend lower. We are still in a support zone so this is a bit tricky as the market could fall more or it could catch support and hold, hard to tell at this point. Pre market is a bit flat so if things don't pick up before the open, I may run a scan or I may even just sit today out, I won't know until I see the trading action after the market opens.  As always, any time there is a chance that the market may pull back, I keep an eye on UVXY in case it shows a good setup. Good luck trading

345,Stock Competition Update: 3 months in,"Hey all,

3 months ago, 47 of us picked 5 stocks to go long for a competition, each weighted equally in the portfolio. I decided to do this not really for the competitive side, but to see how we as Redditors do with stock picking.

You can see the results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jgur-RZuJcwWujWLAGKSeJ3eqCCuskcf4z1y0XprDUU/edit?usp=sharing

""new & improved format"" tab shows each participants' picks

""leaderboard"" tab ranks best performing portfolios*

""stock leaderboard"" tab ranks best performing tickers*

(*the positioning on these lists doesn't update automatically, so don't be alarmed if the order is off)

**FIRST A NOTE ON DIVIDENDS:** I wanted to go through all stocks with dividends and assume reinvestment of dividends to be included in performance. What happened? Well, I didn't do that. It was taking far too long and work/school has been crushing me... no excuses. I should've done it and I didn't. So for stocks with a dividend that has come out in the last 3 months, the results won't be accurate. For that I apologize.


**TIME FRAME: 6/22 - 9/22**

* VTI: +6.7%

* QQQ: +10.4%

* SPY: +6.3%

* DIA: +4.8%


**SOME TAKE AWAYS FROM THE DATA**

* First and foremost, 6/22 - 9/22 is only a 3 month period during a very strange year in the stock market, so any conclusions should be taken with a heavy dose of salt.

* Average participant performance was 13.65%, outperforming the indices by a solid margin. That's fantastic! 

* If you have a couple of solid winners, it doesn't matter if you have some bad losers. Many participants did very well because one of their picks outperformed significantly.

* In this crazy bull market, valuation seems meaningless (unless you're AYX, a company with incredible growth that slowed considerably during the pandemic, and subsequently took a BIG haircut)

* Holding through turbulence is paramount for long term investors. TSLA had some crazy swings from 6/22 - 9/22, but is still up 113% over that time period.

* Of the 47 participants, only 7 had negative performance, indicating that we are still in a strong bull market. 

* Of the 47 participants, 31 outperformed SPY. This validates my belief that stock picking CAN WORK, if one is willing to do the work to have high conviction, and can hold long term through volatility.

* Over this time period, FAANG was up an average of 10.4%, EXACTLY mirroring the performance of QQQ.

**1st place by a long shot: u/Ataraxuh, up 68.82% from 6/22 - 9/22**

* Best performer: NIO, up 158.82%

* Worst performer: TGT, up 25.85%

**2nd place: u/kex06, up 50.58% from 6/22 - 9/22**

* Best performer: NIO, up 158.82%

* Worst performer: NKLA, -59.27%

*Even though NKLA performed terribly, u/kex06 is still in 2nd place due to picking a couple of big winners*

**3rd place: u/thejmils, up 48.85% from 6/22 - 9/22**

* Best performer: NAIL, up 87.43% (leveraged home builders ETF)

* Worst performer: SOXL, up 25.54% (leveraged semiconductor ETF)

*u/thejmils certainly took a different approach and still performed very well. while most of us chose growth/momentum stocks, he/she chose a few leveraged ETFs and the Bank of Montreal*

**TOP 20 PERFORMING STOCKS**

*(I forgot to pull individual prices from 9/22, so percentages are actually for 6/22 - 9/24)*

NIO +140.24%

PENN +103.56% *I really had my money on DKNG over PENN. literally*

TSLA +95.01% *unbelievable that TSLA has performed this well*

LVGO +75.17%

NAIL	+69.53%

PTON +67.00% *as a bike owner and investor, I'm very pleased*

FNGU +62.52%

Z +61.24% *better than RDFN?? seriously?*

TAN +57.72% *somehow the solar ETF did better than ENPH... shocking to me*

ENPH +52.35%

SQ +49.29% *""the bank of the future""*

VWDRY +46.76%

MPNGF +39.75%

AMD	+38.46%

ROKU +37.36% *it FINALLY jumped. this is a core holding in my portfolio*

SE +32.34%

DKNG +32.17%

JMIA	+30.32% *maybe the most volatile stock during this time period*

NVDA +29.61%

TWTR +28.89% *turns out TWTR isn't such a poor performer? that's certainly the way I've looked at it*

**10 WORST PERFORMING STOCKS**

*(I forgot to pull individual prices from 9/22, so this list is actually for 6/22 - 9/24)*

WDI	-94.53% *turns out fraud is a bad thing?*

I D E X -73.56% *not at all sure what this company does... post got auto removed for including a penny stock thus the spaces between letters. silly rule if you ask me*

NKLA -72.71% *see WDI. RIP Trevor.*

AMRS - 40.14%

IVR -39.73%

**Gap Ups:** ARKK, CSIQ, DKNG, DOCU, ETSY, FSLY, GDRX, GNFT, JKS, LAC, NVAX, NVDA, PINS, PLL, PTON, SINA, SQ, TDOC, U, UPS, WKHS, ZM

**Gap Downs**: AQST

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Market gapping up after a nice strong day Friday. We are sitting just below the 50 day moving average on the SPY which could act as support. Pre market is very strong with almost everything on my main watch list for this week gapping. I personally do not like days where the pre market is so lit as I feel many stocks have already made the majority of the move pre market. There will always be good plays regardless but on these days I tend to narrow my focus down after the market opens and only watch the very best stocks. My gap list right now has 53 stocks on it so I will choose a few that I like, so if you see something gapping and it's not on this list it's because there's just too many stocks gapping and this list would be far to big if I added them all. I'm bullish over all but I keep an open mind due to the market still being below the 50 day ma. Good luck trading.

347,ZM and SNOW who is still buying?? ZM CEO just cashed in!,"ZM and SNOW are trading at 100x+ revenue! REVENUE, not gross profits. ZM has a PE ratio of 622,meaning if they have weak growth from here, you could be stuck holding a bag for decades to get a 100% return from this price level. SNOW is burning investor money (negative PE ratio) and is back at its scandalously overvalued IPO price of $250 (buffet bought at $75). ZM is currently trading at 8x value from the start of the year and 2020 Y/Y revenue has increased only 1.9x. $500 is a nice round number, maybe I should buy some ZM puts?

Low and behold, CEO yuan eric sold a whopping $69 million of ZM stock on 9/23 and 9/24 (reported on 9/25 after hours) and currently holds zero shares:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2349b12lpyp51.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18a6361c5c77b5dc5fc30fc80cc39fc9fc2b6527

Like holy crap, if I owned ZM I'd sell it all too at this price level. Who wants to work hard to grow a company when you can cash in and retire on a cool $69 million? MRNA had a similar situation and sold off 35% from 7/17 to 9/2. Huge bear signal. I bet ZM fully fills the gap to $325 within two months.

Why is 100x revenue a lot? NVDA is trading at 22x revenue and AAPL at 7x revenue, and both of these companies are blue chips that are more profitable and have, in my opinion, much better long term growth potential (AI revolution gonna be huge, AAPL and NVDA to the moon).

Also ZM isn't the only company that provides peer to peer voice call service. Did you know that MSFT owns skype? AAPL owns facetime, AMZN owns twitch, and many other companies compete with zoom.

Lastly, Trump announced live today near close that rapid corona virus test kits are rolling out soon, with results available in minutes, and the vaccine is on verge of phase 3 approval. Be sure to spread the word, gl.

348,Investing in ETFs,"A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than that.  Several people suggested that it be ""pinned.""  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

**EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.

**EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.

**S*****ector fund ETFs:***

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution
* **ARKF** \- Fintech
* **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)
* **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence
* **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology
* **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel

**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities
* **XLE** \- Energy
* **XLB** \- Materials
* **XLC** \- Communications
* **XLG** \- S&P Top 50
* **XLI** \- Industrial
* **XLP** \- Consumer Staples
* **XLRE** \- Real Estate

**CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** I had mentioned a couple weeks ago that since the market had broken down under it's moving averages that likely we would get some resistance when trying to break back over, that is whats happening now; either that or we are looking at a continued move lower, hard to tell at this point. Looks like we had a little fade off yesterday when SPY failed break back over the 50 day moving average  thus confirming it at resistance. Ideally we want to see some basing/consolidation action while price builds up the strength it needs to make it back over resistance.  Still some really nice gaps and my main focus will remain on gaps in recent strength names/sectors. Good luck out there,

352,"Electric truck player HYLN ""IPO"" and DD","The time for Hyliion's ""IPO"" (HYLN) has come.

**About Hyliion**

The company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:

> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.

**Investor Presentation**

As someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)

The company's Investor Presentation can be found [here](https://rpn113p35qekzef7411kp2qt-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hyliion-Tortoise-Overview-Presentation.pdf).

As can be shown in the presentation:

1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.

2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.

3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a ""gas station.""

4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).

5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.

6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.

**Renewable Natural Gas**

[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:

> Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy & Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.

RNG production is expected to [double in the near future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WnTNJZTqo4&feature=youtu.be).

**Values and Governance**

Hyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.

One of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.

**Stock Price Disadvantages**

Being an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.

While Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.

**Stock Price Advantages**

Even I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).

**Evaluation**

HYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.

353,"Electric truck player HYLN ""IPO"" and DD","The time for Hyliion's ""IPO"" (HYLN) has come.

**About Hyliion**

The company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:

> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.

**Investor Presentation**

As someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)

The company's Investor Presentation can be found on their website's Investors page.

As can be shown in the presentation:

1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.

2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.

3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a ""gas station.""

4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).

5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.

6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.

**Renewable Natural Gas**

[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:

> Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy & Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.

RNG production is expected to double in the near future.

Infrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.

BNTX- gapping on on news - I would like to see this pull back to the 85 area and hold before considering a long back 87 or better, If this breaks below 85 and confirms I'll short with a target near 81

VIR- gapping up on news-  Chart looks weak, we may see this thing bleed back near 40 before heading higher -44-45 area is the key level to keep an eye on.  If this breaks above 45 and pulls back.. I'll go long with first target near 48 then 50. If the 44-45 area doesn't hold I'm shorting back near 40

ZM- 485 key area- If this pops above 485 and holds 490 should be easy followed by near 495- If this breaks down below 485 and confirms 480 is the first stop followed by a grind to near 470

**Gap Ups:**  ARWR, ATEC, CARV, CCL, ENPH, FLDM, FSLY, ON, IBM, JMIA, LI, NIO, REGN, SEDG, SPCE, SQ, TSLA, U, ZM

**Gap Downs:** DPZ, CYTK

**Possible Day 2 Plays:** GRWG,

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Strong inside day yesterday in the markets after the moving averages held support. My watch lists are getting huge, there are stocks on the move everywhere. I didn't add many stocks to my list yesterday because they were overbought but I didn't like the charts for short setups yet, all those stocks moved higher. This happens in runaway markets, when you think stocks can't move higher but they just keep on going higher. When this happens I don't feel comfortable going long or short so I just look for opportunities in other places. If you see any stocks on my list today that are up more than 4 days in a row and are gapping up, then I am  looking primarily for short setups. This does not mean that the stocks cannot go higher, I personally am just not interested in taking them long at this point. This also does not mean short setups will occur or even work, but I will be watching for the opportunities in case they present themselves. All other stocks, business as usual.  Good Luck out there.

**Possible Day 2 Plays:** LMND, JMIA

**Outlook/Game Plan:** The plan to short the runners yesterday worked great. I hit a really nice short trade on SEDG and was out within a couple minutes. Weed stocks have also had some movement, yesterday TLRY also gave so really nice long trades, I have been watching it for a long time due to the short interest and how bad it has been beaten down.  SPY slightly gapping up pre market and IWM has been on a tear which is good for small and mid caps. Since price action has been so strong, today I will focus on regular gaps. Today is Friday, so there could be some profit taking, be aware of that while holding positions. Next week AA kicks off earnings season and we should see some decent gaps in the next few weeks. Good luck trading, have a good weekend.

**Notes:** I'm working on a new video about why you are losing at trading and some tips to remedy it. Should be out in a week or less if I can get the time. I'll also do a live pre market stream hopefully next week where you all can ask me questions about stocks before the open. I'll get a mic this weekend and try and set everything up. I'll release the date a couple days in advance. If anyone has any questions, email me or shoot me a message.

359,A question from an outsider,"I follow the markets fairly closely but I know very little about algorithmic trading and had a quick question. How exactly markets are able to stay efficient even with the prominence of so many algorithmic trading systems operating on the market at once? For example, it didn't take long for the market to recognize the value of $ZM or to dump $BA despite the indices making new highs and I'm just wondering how exactly algorithmic trading systems are able to still efficiently price these stocks despite the unique factors at play. Is this an error on my part by believing more systems are analyzing price rather than fundamentals and that most of these systems really do analyze fundamental elements of the company? For some reason it seems that if an algorithm is responsible for over 50% of the markets activity you would see more significant errors in the pricing of stocks from a fundamental stand point.",2020-10-10 18:40:36

361,Peloton Goes Parabolic,"Peloton Keeps Pedaling. Last month, we noted that Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON) has been one of the big winners of the COVID-19 economy and looked at ways to hedge it. Since then, Peloton shares have continued their parabolic move. Here we elaborate on that. We also note why our system is currently bullish on it, and show updated ways of hedging it. 

Taking Advantage Of An Opportunity 

Back in May, I argued that government leaders missed an opportunity to mitigate COVID-19 by encouraging citizens to lose weight. 

While government leaders missed this opportunity, Peloton took advantage of it. Peloton sold more of its home exercise equipment and services with gyms closed due to lockdowns. In its most recent quarter, Peloton's revenues increased 99.5% year-over-year. 

Going Parabolic

Peloton's share price has outpaced its revenue growth. When we wrote about hedging Peloton last month, the shares were already up over 220% year-to-date. 

Since then, Peloton shares had climbed another 30% as of the October 9 close.

Why Our System Is Bullish On Peloton Now

Every trading day, our system looks at every security with options traded on it in America, and estimates a potential return for it over the next six months. These are high-end, bullish estimates, and they are driven by an analysis of past returns as well as forward-looking options market sentiment. Essentially, we start with the premise that stock and ETF returns will revert to their long-term means, and then we test that assumption by looking at how options market participants are betting on where each security will be six months from now. 

We then calculate the cost of hedging each name, and then rank every security by its potential return, net of its hedging cost. As of Tuesday's close, these were the top ten names in our daily ranking. 

As you can see above, Peloton was No. 8. Interestingly, the next two names on the ranking, Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) and Teledoc Health Inc (NYSE: TDOC) have also been beneficiaries of COVID-19 lockdowns. 

In Case We're Wrong About Peloton (Or It Pulls Back)

In the event our system is wrong about Peloton, we show updated ways of hedging it in the video below. The methods we use involve scanning for the optimal, or least expensive, put options and collars to protect the stock.

Even if our system's bullishness about Peloton ends up being right, the hedges we show above could work opportunistically for investors if there's a near-term pullback. Longs confident that Peloton will recover from the pullback could sell appreciated put options to buy more shares, while buying-to-close the call legs of their collars to eliminate their upside caps.

Stocks traded higher today as market participants looked ahead to stimulus talks in Washington that appear to be progressing and an upcoming round of quarterly that are expected to be improved relative to earlier in the year.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) was on fire today, finishing the day 3.09%, as the rebound in big tech continues from the September lows.. The S&P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.

Prospects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week’s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that “the bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.” While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. 

Third-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 

For this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), “New information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market.

Third-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 

For this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), “New information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market.

Stocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election

The Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. 

The Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week’s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.

After Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.

Market participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180° turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that “getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details”. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, “I would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.” Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery.

“Life is not about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself” -George Bernard Shaw",2020-10-15 17:45:14
369,Recovery stocks are the obvious play from here.,"Hi, fairly seasoned investor here. I've done fairly well this year (up roughly 55% YTD and actively managing my portfolio daily). Honestly, I'm a bit bewildered by all the love for tech that still exists here. To me, it's pretty obvious that from here on out, the next 40-50% gains will come from the recovery stocks, not tech. 

What do I mean by recovery stocks? Retail, commercial real estate, airlines, casinos, cruise lines, financials.

Why? Allow me to borrow a couple minutes of your time.

**Vaccine vaccine vaccine.** There is a widespread belief, which I agree with, that we will not have an approved vaccine available for the public to use until early next year. However, that is a dumb reason to not buy recovery stocks. The question you should be asking is: will we know that one of the many vaccines that are out there is effective and safe by the end of this year? Once we have a vaccine candidate that we know is effective and is safe, then the game is over. It does not matter if that vaccine won't be approved for a few weeks after, or won't be available for widespread use for a few months. The market looks forward. Once it becomes clear that a vaccine is ready and is coming sometime within the next 6 months, the recovery stocks will boom. 

So, when will we know? Pfizer has said that they should know by the end of October whether a vaccine is effective, and will release some data around then. If their Phase 3 data is positive, then I expect a huge rally in the recovery stocks. I expect their phase 3 data to be positive, given the positive phase 1/2 data, the cloaked positive comments in the press by Pfizer execs, and my belief in mRNA's potential.

**Ok well even if we get a vaccine approved we don't know if people will even take it, right?**. Of course they will. Sure, there will likely be only a small cohort of brave souls initially who take it, but once they take it and find it effective and low on side effects, they will tell their circle of friends/family, some of whom will then take it themselves, and then tell their circle, etc. etc. People want someone else to be one of the first to take it, but like with many things, once they hear it recommended from their friends who took it, they will themselves take it. Also, let's not forget that we won't need 100% vaccination rate for things to get back to mostly normal, and a lot of activities that were previously restricted (like international travel) will likely be available again only to vaccinated folks, which will further boost vaccination rates and create a self-reinforcing cycle.

**Ok but things will never fully return back to the way things were, right?** Probably not 100%, but I think 80%, yes, and much more quickly than you think. There is so much fearful talk of remote work being the way forward, and that no one wants offices anymore, and why would you ever travel for business again. I think this is all blown WAY out of proportion. For God's sakes guys, this is the way we've been doing things for many decades. People's habits won't just change on a dime like that because of a 9-12 month situation that is temporary. People will still want to see each other face to face, people will still go to offices, etc. I mean, I work remotely for my job, and it sucks. Meetings are confusing, I find myself procrastinating and not being nearly as efficient/productive as I was when I was in an office, team cohesion is down. Many employers do not like remote work because productivity is decreased significantly, and it's employers who will set the policy. Now, sure, maybe we have more remote work than we did before. Maybe it's an option for some people, maybe you work 1-2 days remotely per week or something, fine. But I don't think this justifies a 300-600% run up in some of these work from home stocks, and I expect to see those absolutely crater once we have a vaccine.

**Ok, but the stock prices of these recovery stocks won't return to normal for quite a while, right?** Not only will they, but they'll surpass their previous pre-covid levels. Why? The Fed, and short covering. The Fed has inflated the prices of all the 'hot' stocks. PTON, ZM, FSLY, etc. all have had huge run ups because tech was hot, and people had a lot of money to invest. Once the recovery stocks are hot, they will be inflated too. The Fed has committed to keeping rates low for at least another couple years (due to wanting inflation pegged at 2%), so rates will be low even after we have a vaccine. Short interest in some of the recovery names are also quite high, so short covering will drive these stocks even higher than you'd expect.

**Ok, but, a second wave is coming, right?** Probably, but a second wave at this point should mean nothing to recovery stocks. It's all about the vaccine. If a vaccine is shown to be effective in November, but we get hit with a second wave in December, who cares? Yes maybe these companies will have 1-2 months of pain, but again, the market looks way forward, and once you have a vaccine, the light at the end of the tunnel will be blaring, and you'll ignore the bumps on the way.

**Ok, so why not just buy the recovery stocks when/if they come out with positive data?** Yeah, you could I guess, if you're a very risk averse investor or not totally convinced. However, I would not be surprised to see some of the more hard hit recovery stocks up by 15-20% after positive vaccine data (for example, ALK was \~$65 pre-covid, but is now at \~$38. If a vaccine is shown to be effective tomorrow let's say, I don't think it'd be unreasonable to see that stock shoot up to $44 pre-market). Even then I'd still expect more upside though, so I'd be a buyer there. However, I'd personally prefer to cash in on those 15-20% gains as well as the future upside, which is why I'm a buyer here.

**Ok, well, what are the risks?** The risks are mainly around a covid vaccine not being effective or being unsafe. If that happens, then recovery stocks will take a serious beating. You also may see some short term pain if covid cases jump before vaccine data is released, as some folks/algos in the market take that as meaning 'sell recovery, buy tech'. Also, make sure you buy companies with very strong balance sheets, as if there are any unexpected bumps in the road with a vaccine, you don't want to be stuck with a company you're worried about going bankrupt.

**I would really really appreciate feedback on this.** I'm investing a lot of money in these stocks, and am by no means blind to the risks. I would really love hearing from everyone here about the things I missed or am not considering. If you have something I'm missing, and can potentially save me many many thousands of dollars, please please take a few minutes and just share that comment here. Thanks for your time reading this!",2020-10-15 17:59:38

Pre market action is pretty weak, not many stocks interest me. Today we'll have to see if we get some more follow through from yesterday or if we get some more selling as we try and hold the 9. As we get further into earnings season I will stop paying as much attention to the market and I will focus on earnings specific plays as they should move independently from the market. Have a good weekend. Good luck trading. See you all Monday.

372,Everything Is Priced In: Let's calculate how much growth Zoom and Tesla have priced in,"**TL;DR:** Puts on ZM, TSLA

You probably have heard the phrase or even shit posted it yourself: ""It's priced in"". Usually, it's used to easily dismiss someone else's well-crafted DD, however today let's use it to actually do something useful with it. Let's find out, how much growth is priced in in the current price of Zoom and Tesla. As a comparison I also included Microsoft and P&G.

Now follows the detailed description of how I calculated that. If you are only interested in the results, scroll to the bottom.

How would you even calculate something like that? I will do it with the so-called [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow). The intuition behind it is that by buying stock you essentially lose out on the returns the cash you used to buy the stock could yield somewhere else, like if you invested it in bonds or an S&P 500 ETF (or of course in FDs, whatever floats your boat). So, this model takes this into account by treating the cash you pay today (or more accurately, its current market cap) as a discounted cash flow of the future returns.

To be able to use this model, we need to make several assumptions. First, we need to decide on a time-frame in which we expected the company to completely earn its current valuation. I will use 10 years here as a very generous value.

Second, we need to decide what the cash flow actually will be. For this very simplified application of the DCF model I used the Net Income of the last quarter. I will call this N. In the end we want to have a growth rate as a result which tells us how much the quarterly earnings will need to increase every quarter to earn its entire valuation in the given time-frame. I will call this q.

To account for the equity a company already has, its current equity E must also be included in its future returns. Again, as a very generous estimation, I will assume that the equity will appreciate like the average returns of the S&P 500 in the last 10 years which is 16.3%.

Finally we need the discounted cash value. This is the current market cap M of the company. We also need to decide on an interest rate to discount M. Again, very generously, instead of assuming that M should also be assumed to have the average S&P 500 returns, we will instead only use the much lower, essentially risk-free returns of the 10Y US bonds, which currently is 0.75%.

To summarize, we made the following assumptions:

* Time frame of 10 years
* Equity E appreciates by average S&P 500 returns of 16.3% every year
* Cash flow is given by the net quarterly income N
* Current market cap M is discounted by 10Y US bond yield, which is 0.75%

Now, we can formulate the following equation that puts the expected growth of N into relation with the other variables:

    E * 1.163^10 + N * (q^(4 * 10) - 1) / (q - 1) = M * 1.0075^10

(Equity in 10 years plus quarterly earnings of the next 10 years that grow by q every quarter must equal discounted market cap )

Now we only need to select a company and solve the equation for q. This can be done by using approximation methods like Newton's method, or just plug it into Wolfram Alpha.

As mentioned in the title, let's first start with Zoom and Tesla. All values are in Million USD:

##Zoom:

    E = 1198.81
    N = 185.99
    M = 160400

This gives us q = 1.12575 as a result. So, for Zoom, its current market cap has a yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 60.61% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*. Note that this already includes the Q2 earnings which were almost 7 times higher than Q1 earnings.

##Tesla:

    E = 9855
    N = 11202
    M = 1658500

This results in q = 1.17685. So, for Tesla, its current market cap has a even larger yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 91.82% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*.

##Microsoft and P&G:

For comparison, let's also calculate this for less meme-y stocks. I chose Microsoft and P&G, let me know if you want to know the results for other stocks.

Microsoft:

    E = 118304
    N = 11202
    M = 1658500
    => q = 1.04679
    => q^4 - 1 = 20.07%

P&G:

    E = 46521
    N = 2800
    M = 358600
    => q = 1.02179
    => q^4 - 1 = 9.01%


Disclaimer: This is a very simplified calculation which makes many assumptions: We only look at a companies net income of the last quarter, its current equity and its market cap, nothing else. Also, this looks at a rather large time-frame of 10 years, so is not that useful for short-term stock price predictions.

To summarize: By using the DCF model we can calculate that Zoom and Tesla have priced in into their current market cap outrageously high growth rates already for the next 10 years. Around 60% and 90%, respectively.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** After a choppy, inside day yesterday, the SPY is gapping down pre market. We are now under our moving averages which have acted as resistance. Support around the 330/331 level and after that the 320 level. Everything is gapping down, my overall watch list is huge. This will be a tough day as we are getting oversold and the gap in the market is huge. If you are new to trading this is a very difficult time to trade so you may want to sit out and watch. Right now it is important that we are very selective with what we trade. I will be focusing mainly on earnings related plays and try to stay away from the rest of the noise. Good luck out there.

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

Here is an example Finviz TML Scan: [https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8](https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8)

399,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 9, 2020","**Summary**

Stocks roared to record highs this morning before tapering off throughout the day. Market participants digested the election of Joe Biden and the release of promising data for a coronavirus vaccine.

On Saturday, the historical presidential election finally came to a conclusion. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee and former Vice President, was declared the victor after mounting a remarkable comeback in Pennsylvania, a state Trump won in 2016. The Associated Press called the race Saturday morning. Biden promised to work toward uniting a deeply divided nation, calling for an end of “this grim era of demonization in America” and saying “I see no blue states or red states. Only the United States.”

President Trump, on the other hand, is refusing to concede the election and is mounting a legal challenge, claiming widespread voter fraud. After news broke of Biden’s victory, he tweeted “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!” In a statement yesterday, Pres. Trump said, “The simple fact is this election is far from over. Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. Several of Trump’s fellow Republican colleagues have publicly expressed disapproval of the President’s actions. We’ll provide updates as this situation develops.

After Biden’s win, a split government, in which different parties control the Senate and the White House is looking likely.  According to a number of analysts, traders like a divided government, where no single party would control each of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Under that scenario, major policy changes are unlikely to get advanced. Stephanie Miller, managing director of Fiscal Note Markets, said, “What Wall Street wants more than everything is for nothing to happen in Washington. There is so much of a bias for a static policy environment – that you can actually make business decisions and have those decisions hold the test of time beyond a couple of years. And so more gridlock in Washington tends to be better.” 

This morning Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech announced that their clinical trial showed that a 90% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in participants with no evidence of a previous infection. “Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19. With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis.,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO.

**Highlights**

* The European Union will impose tariffs on up to $4 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation for U.S. subsidies for Boeing (BA), but said on Monday it was hopeful of an improvement in trade ties under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden.
* Shares of firearms sellers tumbled on Monday as promising data from a COVID-19 vaccine trial knocked stay-at-home stocks, and as civil unrest failed to materialize after Democrat Joe Biden emerged as the winner of last week's presidential election.
* Shares of Beyond Meat (BYND) is falling Monday, following news that fast-food giant McDonald's will produce its own faux meat. USA Today reported on Monday that McDonald's (MCD) will unveil McPlant, a line of meat alternatives that will launch with tests of a faux burger next year \\

400,"Pandemic 'stay at home stocks' like Peloton, Zoom, Roku tank on Pfizer vaccine news—is it an overreaction?","Pfizer on Monday morning [announced that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-114500360.html), developed in partnership with BioNTech, was more than 90% effective in studies and that it could distribute 50 million doses before the end of this year, and 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

The good news immediately sent [U.S. markets broadly higher](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/election-2020-stock-market-news-updates-november-9-2020-231320807.html)—especially airline stocks, energy names, bank stocks, in-person entertainment like theme parks, and real estate—except for a slew of key names that have seen huge gains during the pandemic, boosted by prolonged work-from-home trends.

Those “stay-at-home stocks” were hit hard.

Peloton ([PTON](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON/)) fell by as much as 25%; Logitech ([LOGI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/)) fell 19%; Zoom Video ([ZM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM/)) dropped 17%; CrowdStrike ([CRWD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/)) fell 11%; Chewy ([CHWY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHWY/)) fell 10%; Roku ([ROKU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/)) sunk 7%; Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) fell 6%; Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) was down 4%.

The market thinking appears to be: a widely available vaccine will prompt a return to normalcy, which will mean the end of the hockey-stick run for products and services you use in your home.

But that reductive logic doesn’t apply equally well to every stay-at-home name. Rather, the post-pandemic prospects for each business have to be examined on a case-by-case basis.

## Remote work won’t abruptly end with a vaccine

Since early on in the pandemic, analysts and experts have predicted that some form of [remote work](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-a-remote-work-boom-will-affect-salaries-jobs-and-where-people-live-190344317.html) is here to stay—after all, it was a trend already growing before the pandemic. If that’s the case, then many companies are going to continue to use enterprise tools like Zoom and Slack, even once offices reopen. Whether workers are in their office or at home, teams that use Slack aren’t going to just stop using it.

In Zoom’s case, the stock has also become extremely expensive. It trades at more than 800 times earnings, so it was arguably due for a big correction. The vaccine news provided an excuse for firms to take some profit and move into other names, like the battered stocks set to take off now that a vaccine is imminent. (As for Slack, increased competitive threat from Microsoft Teams is also contributing to its slide.)

The same “here to stay” thinking with the enterprise names can apply broadly to streaming services like Netflix and Roku: just because people might return to their offices doesn’t mean they will stop streaming at home.

In Roku’s case, the dip makes a little more sense, since Roku relies on ad revenue from ads on its home screen, and advertisers might indeed shuffle their budgets away from Roku if they think time spent on streaming will drop significantly. For Netflix, which makes its revenue from subscriptions (it doesn’t sell ad space or sell user data), the stock dive would only make sense if you think a significant number of subscribers will cancel Netflix after the pandemic.

Peloton is its own case: the exercise-bike company took off early in the pandemic amid staggering demand for its bikes, creating wait times of 5-10 weeks on orders. As the stock surged, some analysts warned of a “pull-forward in demand,” the idea that Peloton cannot sustain this level of sales and would be punished later on because shareholder expectations would get too high. But in its [fourth-quarter earnings report in September](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-new-highs-q4-earnings-and-revenue-202044922.html), Peloton had its first profit and showed massive continued demand for its bikes, making the bear case look wrong. (Meanwhile, Netflix, in contrast, actually did see in Q3, and explicitly identified, a [pull-forward in demand from the first half of 2020 that hurt its subscription adds](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflixs-q-3-demonstrates-the-dreaded-pandemic-pullforward-in-demand-193405344.html).) Once gyms fully reopen across the country, will Peloton bike sales really dry up?

On the other hand, Peloton stock, like Zoom, got extremely expensive (trading at a 15x P/E ratio), so it was due for a correction as soon as there was any indication that the end of the pandemic is in sight.

## Buy online, pick up in store

One good example of a trend accelerated by the pandemic that is generally expected not to reverse is e-commerce and the rise of BOPIS (buy online, pick up in store) for brick-and-mortar retail.

[Walmart, Target, Best Buy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-and-target-huge-ecommerce-gains-are-a-blaring-siren-to-brickandmortar-retail-192709224.html), Urban Outfitters, [Restoration Hardware](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-restoration-hardware-stock-is-up-240-during-the-pandemic-180244236.html), and [Dick’s Sporting Goods](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-is-wildly-outperforming-amid-the-pandemic-195504143.html) are just some of the physical retail names seeing enormous e-commerce gains, so much so that the share of U.S. retail spending attributed to e-commerce has surged to 16.1%, up from 10.8% one year ago.

Those chains have also seen [huge customer adoption of curbside pickup](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/curbside-pickup-is-exceptionally-sticky-and-will-continue-postpandemic-mc-kinsey-retail-expert-183712446.html). Dick’s Sporting Goods president Lauren Hobart said in August that Dick’s “anticipated originally that we would see a large drop-off \[in curbside\] when the stores reopened, but that is not the case.” Many retail analysts predict that even after the pandemic, consumers will stick with their new behavior and shop online, for home delivery or curbside pickup.

Whole Foods CEO [John Mackey disagrees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whole-foods-ceo-does-not-think-online-grocery-will-remain-the-norm-postpandemic-food-is-different-175009302.html)—he thinks some people will stick to online ordering, but that it won’t remain the norm for most. Even if he’s right, what that creates is a hybrid landscape for physical retail and physical grocery.

The same applies to remote work: even if a large number of workers return to the office, many more workers than before the pandemic are going to keep working from home, which should be good for enterprise names like Zoom, Slack, and CrowdStrike.

Wharton professor Mauro Guillen writes in his new book, “2030: How Today’s Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything,” that beyond the pandemic we should expect a “hybrid model” of working that allows for remote-work a few days a week, and continued automation of service warehouses.

“Most of what I hear from companies right now is that we're going to go to a hybrid model,” [Guillen told Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whartons-mauro-guillen-trends-shape-203000781.html) in August. “So, a majority of American employees who are working from home now, they're saying, ‘Yes, I would like to have a remote component in my work week, but I would like to also go to the office.’”

Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell sounds a similar tune. He insists that the recent sales boom for Logitech’s computer accessories [can’t be totally chalked up the pandemic, but to four “secular” shifts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/logitech-ceo-4-trends-are-driving-our-sales-boost-not-just-the-pandemic-141208902.html): “One is video going everywhere, whether it’s offices or webcams. The second one is the rise of gaming as a professional sport, and as a bigger and bigger spectator sport; it’ll be the biggest collection of sports in the world one day. The third one is working from anywhere. The fourth is everybody creating their own content and streaming it, which lends itself well to our microphones. All four of those are long-term secular trends.”

But of course, Darrell has to hope so for his business. The other companies labeled “stay at home names” during the pandemic are all hoping their momentum continues, even once we get a vaccine.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola ￼ (NKLA) and NIO ￼ (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla ￼ (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller’s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers’ deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company’s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

The advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.

Calpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.

Tesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday’s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.

The electric-vehicle giant’s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.

413,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 16, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 16, 2020**

The stock market rallied today, with the Dow Jones reaching record highs, after Moderna (MRNA) announced promising data for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, adding to hopes that an effective vaccine may soon be available. Remember Pfizer (PFE) also announced positive vaccine data last week.

The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.19% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.78% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing the day 1.67% up.

Early Monday, Moderna (MRNA) announced that preliminary data from its late-stage clinical trial showed its vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 in participants. This study, known as the COVE study, enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the U.S. Based on the data, the company said it “ intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks.” The company reported they expect to have prepared 20 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year and between 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021. The company is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Operation Warp Speed, McKesson (MCK), and governments across the globe to plan for distribution. Moderna’s vaccine candidate is a lot easier to ship than Pfizer’s candidate, which requires super cold temperatures. The company said, “vaccine candidate now expected to remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for 30 days, up from the previous estimate of 7 days. Shipping and long-term storage conditions at standard freezer temperatures of -20°C (-4°F) for 6 months. mRNA-1273 is to be distributed using widely available vaccine delivery and storage infrastructure. However, it is important to note that setting up a global distribution network for the vaccine is likely to take months. Here is the link to the Company’s press release: [https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy))

Over the weekend, the United States topped 11 million coronavirus cases, with 250,000 people tragically dead, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US is nearly averaging 150,000 new infections per day, the most since the pandemic started by a wide margin, with the number still growing. Around four weeks ago, the US first crossed the 100,000 cases per day mark for the first time. In recent days, more cities and states have added curfews and tightened their restrictions on daily activities as case counts soar. New Jersey’s new daily COVID-19 cases hit a record high on Saturday, and Illinois and Ohio both saw record numbers of new cases on Friday. Chicago posted a stay-at-home advisory late last week, and New York state had a new 10 p.m. curfew on bars, restaurants and gyms go into effect Friday. Oregon ordered a two-week “freeze” on non-essential business activity and large social gatherings. The recent surge in case is once again straining hospital capacity, with around 70,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across the US. This number is also growing at a record rate. Therefore, during the next weeks we expect a gradual tightening of restrictions nationwide. While it is highly unlikely we return a lockdown like earlier in the year, we expect states to enact restrictions to combat the recent surge in cases.

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.

Please let me know if you found this post valuable. I'm considering starting a tech/investing newsletter where I analyse tech trends and look at associated investment opportunities. Would love to know if that's something people would be interested in.

&#x200B;

**Bottoms-Up Software Sales**

The ""bottoms up"" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.

The premise behind the bottoms-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottoms-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.

For example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.

There are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottoms-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottoms-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.

## What's so special about bottoms-up?

There are a number of distinct advantages to the bottoms-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.

&#x200B;

* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottoms-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.
* **More money for R&D.** Since bottoms-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  
   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....
* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottoms-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.
* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottoms-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.

## What to look for in a bottoms-up company

Not all bottoms-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

* **Look for a ""receptive"" market.** The bottoms-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.
* **World-class design.** Bottoms-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.
* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottoms-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottoms-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.
* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottoms-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.
* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.

## Bottoms-Up Companies

Below are some bottoms-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).

### Asana ($ASAN):

Asana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottoms-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.

I like Asana for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottoms-up strategy is working very well.
2. **R&D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottoms-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.
3. **Product & design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.
4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.

### Slack ($WORK) :

Slack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.

I like Slack for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.
2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottoms-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.
3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottoms-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.

### Honourable Mentions:

423,Investment opportunities in tech companies who adopt this go-to-market strategy,"Hi,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.

# Bottom-Up Software Sales

The ""bottom up"" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.

The premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.

For example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.

There are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.

# What's so special about bottom-up?

There are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.

&#x200B;

* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.
* **More money for R&D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  
   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....
* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.
* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.

## What to look for in a bottom-up company

Not all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

* **Look for a ""receptive"" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.
* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.
* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.
* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.
* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.

## Bottom-Up Companies

Below are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).

### Asana ($ASAN):

Asana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.

I like Asana for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.
2. **R&D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.
3. **Product & design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.
4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.

### Slack ($WORK) :

Slack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.

2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottom-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.

425,Swing and daytrading mostly naked options,"Always liked the stock market.  Got my feet wet with stocks straight out of college, and blew up my account twice because i didn't know what i was doing.  Fast forward to this year, decided to try again.  This time, I had a bigger account was far more knowledgeable on stock market and individual company fundamentals.  I took part of my investment out and dove into my own trading method with a mixture of swing trading naked short call/puts, short straddles, and occasional day trades here and there based entirely on gut feeling from price action.

As to why I prefer shorting options and recommend doing so goes back to an ex hedge fund guy i met a while back.  The way he put it - 'if the stock market was a casino, and option buyers were the gamblers, then what does that make option seller?  The house.  The expected value of the house is positive.  The house always wins.""

Here's my top 10 winners and losers since March.  As you can see most of my gains are from TSLA, which I have been selling puts and short straddles for 6 months.

My worst loss was from short straddling ZM on 8 separate strikes when the stock was trading at 580 (Premium was  $100, which i thought was safe).  I scaled out of my positions for a loss when I realized things weren't going my way, and closed out entirely without any second thought when the stock broke 480.

CHK was also an interesting loss, because I sold naked calls during the crazy short squeeze from $16 - 70.  The unrealized losses were actually far more severe, but I knew fundamentals would play out eventually, which cut my losses greatly.

PLTR is the only one on the list where the gains came from long options (2022 leaps)  I bought 30 jan 20/22 strike leaps with a cost basis of 1.6-1.7, before the big move.  Sold 1/3 before earnings and another 1/3 last night.  Letting the rest ride through 2021.

I generally keep 80-90% cash in this account, as I also look for opportunities around big drops, such as GDRX this week.

- Lockdowns coming in fast (Illinois, Ontario eh)
- Cases rising more each day (USA numba one!!1)
- Thanksgiving coming on Thursday (people saying use Zoom versus visiting)
- Zoom is offering unlimited time on Thanksgiving. Solid PR by them. Gets people talking 
- Zoom earnings report November 30th after hours. Stock went up fast last ER run up then jumped 45%+/- next day. Remember that? Also, remember negative oil?
- Cases rising and lockdowns = boomers, WSB, and millennial plebs rotating their Robinhood accounts back into tech and home stocks.

**The Big Short**

You morons ever see the Big Short? No? Well, let me give you a rundown:

* Autist reads about a million pages of subprime housing loan structures.
* Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default.
* Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market.
* Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something.
* Housing market collapses, he makes billions.

So that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.

Some of his other notable trades this year are:

* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out.
* PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2,  currently trading at $17.85.
* BBBY, 1 million shares bought around  $10.60, currently trading at $20.24
* CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.

**Overview**

I  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.

What is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.

A  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.

Out are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  ""4IR"", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.

Some of their business exposure includes:

* Adaptive  Network Systems
* Advanced Collaboration Platforms
* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence
* Edge Computing \*Hybrid Cloud Networks

Now I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?

[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)

**Financials:**

* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.
* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.
* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.
* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.
* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.

But revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.

[Q3 ER](https://ir.lumen.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Lumen-Technologies-Inc-Q3-2020-Earnings/default.aspx)

I  think this is a positive growth stock moving forward. Additionally,  with further lockdowns on the horizon, we should start to see this equity continue to pick up traction, think NFLX, ZM, etc.

[In ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/fiber-optic-cable-market)[fact, this report from Mordor Intelligence estimates that the CAGR of  Fiber Optics and IT solutions will grow at a 15% rate by 2025. ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/fiber-optic-cable-market)

Positions: 1/21 10c, 4/21 12c, 7/21 15c, and 11/21 15c

These contracts are dirt cheap folks, all under a buck as it stands right now. Let Dr. Michael Burry do you and your portfolio a favor and hop on the Tendie Train.

TL;DR: LUMN 1/21 10c, 4/21 12c, 7/21 15c, and 11/21 15c.

EDIT 2 11/21 20:17 CST: Jesus fuck it's Saturday don't you degenerates ever go outside? Well, I guess since this has gained some traction hasn't it boys?

I'll post some additional information tomorrow to address some of the comments and questions below. I can't do that shit tonight, I have a date with u/DonaldJTrumpsGhost's wife.

EDIT 3: FUCK ME 2 HOURS INTO THIS UPDATE AND REDDIT TAKES A SHIT.

I'm not redoing this tonight. Fucking P/E, P/B and P/S ratios, graphs, and everything for you degenerates.

EDIT 4 11/23 20:47: Alright let's try this one again. Below is some additional information to the Bears in the comments who brought up some really great points. Thanks, guys. I'm still right though, and here's why:

First I'm gonna get this out of the way: Everyone who's saying ""bUrRy sUcKs uR cHeRrY pIcKiNg"", ur momma's a hoe.

Ok, I would have thought this goes without saying, but yeah, Burry loses trades. He's not out there batting 100%, or whatever the bullshit way y'all score batting averages in that boring ass sport.

Then again, he definitely is some flavor of Autistic. You ever hang around one? These are the same people who will repeatedly punch themselves in the face because they don't like their new fleece-lined jacket, then play piano sonata no. 14 after hearing Beethoven once. This boy is major leagues, y'all still playing T-Ball.

Anyways let's look at some price ratios:

* PE Ratio: 8.40 compared to industry average 16.46.
* PB Ratio: .80 compared to industry average 2.64.
* PS Ratio: .52 compared to industry average of 2.48.

Don't know what these mean? Well fucking google it. Or youtube it if you have trouble reading. Point here is you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. This is a company that did $21bn in revenue (TTM) and is trading around $10 bucks a share. LUMN is rapidly reducing their debt, recently offering a $750m Private Debt deal to Qwest. Further, they are soon going ex-dividend, which I have seen as a drag on their growth and value. The current dividend yield is about 10%, and getting rid of this will help reduce liability. You got 3 days folks, if you don't own shares by 11/27, no mas dividends. So you know, buy some of this shit.

Subsidiaries & Partnerships:

In a nod to my previous point, I think LUMN was a dying telecom giant who has shifted their focus to all the fancy tech shit people like these days. LUMN owns a lot of companies and has partnered with some household names. They are casting a very wide net, people:

* Level 3 Communications, subsidy.
* Qwest, subsidy.
* Prism TV, subsidy.
* Savvis, subsidy.
* Expanded their partnership with Zoom to integrate video calling capabilities into their platform.
* Increased edge computing exposure by partnering with VMware.
* Gained exposure to virtual learning in public schools by partnering with Sunberry.
* [More](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/partner/strategic-alliance.html)

The list goes on and on.

New Market Enterprises:

The estimated CAGR for the demand for low-latency, modular fiber networks in the Asian market is expected to grow at about 9% over the next 5 years. Guess who has the largest fiber network in the world and is strategically positioned to provide the network backbone to the next generation of internet customers in Asia? Verizon! I'm kidding its LUMN. The Asian market demand is only second to the expected growth in North America.

The aggressive shift to accommodating the rapidly growing tech sector is again the right move by Lumen. Every aspect of their new generation of products is performing well. You might not know it yet, but we are living through a bit of a paradigm shift in the way we communicate and behave. The rapid  growth of the tech industry is a testament to that. I believe that LUMN will act as one of the major suppliers of the growing technological central nervous system. Trust me. At least this isn't a fucking mattress company.

CEO Satya Nadella disclosed on Microsoft’s Oct. 27 earnings call that Teams’ daily active user (DAU) count has risen above 115 million. That’s up from 75 million as of late April and just 20 million as of Oct. 2019.",2020-11-22 09:53:30

 ***$WWR:***

03:41 AM EST, 11/23/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Westwater Resources (WWR) on Friday filed a registration statement covering the potential sale of up to $150 million in securities.

The securities, which may be offered from time to time, include common shares, debt securities, warrants and units, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Unless stated in a prospectus supplement, net proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes, including advancing the company's graphite business, working capital and for funding of future acquisitions.     
Breakout underway on the daily chart. Could see this one gap up like $KXIN did last week. Picked up a starter position in the pre-market for a swing.

 ***$OEG:***

**Financial and Operating Highlights:**

* Reported total revenues of $13.6 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $6.1 million for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 124%, primarily attributable to the addition of Reach Construction Group (""Reach"") and the Company's Orbital Power Services group;
* Gross profit was $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2019 with the improvement mainly due to increased revenues; this improvement is expected to persist throughout the remainder of 2020 and into 2021;
* Gross margin was 17.3% for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 23.4% for the third quarter of 2019;
* Operating loss was $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $3.7 million in the prior year period, mainly due to higher SG&A expenses associated with Orbital Power Services and the addition of Reach during the second quarter;
* Held Cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million and Restricted cash of $3.6 million as of September 30, 2020; and
* Total backlog was $52.0 million at September 30, 2020, up from $46.4 million at June 30, 2020, reflecting backlog growth at both Reach Construction and Orbital Power Services.

 ***$GO (Blue Chip):***

NOTE: This gapped down on great earnings, this is not a PEG. HOWEVER, I still want to monitor this behavior going forward, as it could provide us with a new opportunity down the road. Grocery Outlet has beat expectations 4 out of the last 4 quarters.

Looks like an incredible overreaction, or too many people played the run-up into earnings. This stock has a tendency to be highly volatile, even though just over the past 6 months the stock has seen incredible gains.   
Reversal currently underway, with most indicators showing bullish. Analyst price targets all support that this stock is undervalued, and I’m personally looking for a PT around $42.

437,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, November 23, 2020. PLease enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 23, 2020**

Stocks rallied Monday, for the third straight week, after more positive vaccine news from AstraZeneca (AZN). The current surge in infections and hospitalizations across the US emphasizes the need for an effective vaccine to combat the virus. Despite record infections, the market has been broadly encouraged by the steady stream of good vaccine news the last three weeks.

Over the weekend, AstraZeneca (AZN) and the University of Oxford announced the results of their clinical trail which showed their vaccine candidate was highly effective at 90%, relatively cheap, and easy to store. The results are based on analysis of a study involving 11,363 participants in the UK and Brazil. Moreover, the company announced the vaccine can be stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning distribution can be done with existing infrastructure. These developments came on the heels of Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) announcing plans to file for an emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would allow them to have their vaccine used in the U.S. starting in December.

A successful vaccine is seen by market participants as a necessary component for safe, sustained, and broad economic reopening. According to Yahoo Finance, an estimated 27 million workers, around 22% of the workforce, work in close physical proximity with others. In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a vaccine is a crucial component. However, it is essential to note that even after approval by the requisite agencies, the production and distribution of literally billions of vaccine doses will be a massive and challenging logistical undertaking, unlikely to happen until 2021.

Expectations for relatively quick distribution of a vaccine have boosted the broader market this month and analyst expectations for 2021, despite the recent surge in cases. Cyclical and reopening stocks, that had previously underperformed are rallying, while previously high-flying, stay-at-home stocks, like Peleton (PTON), Zoom (ZM), and Netflix (NFLX) to retreat. However, given the uncertainty in Washington surrounding the election and stimulus and record Covid-19 infections, we expect volatility to keep up in the short-term. 

**Highlights**

439,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Nov 24, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 24, 2020**

Stocks rallied today with market participants optimistic that an effective coronavirus vaccine can be deployed in the near term. The Dow Jones hit 30,000 points for the first time ever, extending a crazy rally of more than 10% in November. In spite the good news, the surge in coronavirus cases continues in the US.

The Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 1.53% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.41% up and the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.61%. Overall a great day for the market.

Expectations for relatively quick distribution of the vaccine has analysts upgrading their growth prospects for 2021. A fully inoculated public would bring back beaten-down industries, like travel and cruise lines, that were devastated by social distancing guidelines. As a result, market participants have rotated out of stay-at-home stocks like Zoom (ZM) and Peleton and into reopening and cyclical stocks. 

The political uncertainty in the United States is beginning to clear up. Weeks after Joe Biden was declared President-Elect, General Service Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy acknowledged Biden’s win and approved the official transition process. The GSA is a government agency that works largely behind the scenes to support other federal entities, with responsibility for managing federal office space, procuring supplies and improving the use of technology across the government. The GSA provides a presidential transition team with Washington office space and coordinates access to federal agencies to plan potential policy changes with current administration officials, using $6.3 million allocated to support its efforts. This will finally allow Biden’s team to gain access to crucial information needed to effectively govern the nation. Mark Haefele, UBS Global chief investment officer, said, “We believe that the recent reduction in political uncertainty in the U.S., though far from complete, is another supportive factor behind the recent stock rally,

Markets were also encouraged by Biden’s appointment of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to Treasury  Secretary. Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014-2018, helping steer the historic bull market that followed the 2008 recession.

Finally, after four painful weeks, the surge in coronavirus infections are showing early signs of improvement. The national weekly average for daily new infections is 172,118, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that is an all-time record, it only represents an 11% increase to last week. In the past four weeks, average daily new infections were posting a roughly 30-40% increase every week. The daily average deaths are more than 1,500, similar level to early May.

# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**
*****
> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
> “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
> “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.
*****
> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
> # Jobs report
> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
> “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
> “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.”

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

> “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs.

> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",2020-11-28 10:24:47
447,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.

# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**
*****
> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
> “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
> “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.
*****
> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
> # Jobs report
> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
> “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.

> “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the ‘average’ stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn’t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.

> Let’s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.

> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into ’21, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.

> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

**Gap Downs:** JMIA, NKLA

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Friday was hot. We made some quick but powerful plays and were done early. This morning the SPY is gapping down slightly but there are plenty of stocks gapping up. Price action has been and remains bullish at this moment. The SPY is now sitting at the top of the daily range near highs with the 9ema (short term ma) right below. Nearest support under the 9 ema is the 354 pivot and the 20 dma. Looks like there's some interest in these SPACs because that's mostly what is gaping pre market. My focus will remain on recent momentum and stocks with catalyst. I may put 1 or 2 spacs on the list but they won't be my main focus. Good luck trading.

455,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 1, 2020","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 1, 2020**

Stocks continued rising today, with each of the major indices hitting fresh intraday record, before selling off somewhat in the last hour of the market. Market participants are eager to extend gains after a historic November performance. The Dow posted its biggest monthly gain since January 1987 with an advance of nearly 11.9%. In the S&P 500, the energy, financials, and industrials sectors led the index’s 10.8% rise, as market participants rotated back into many of the names that had been beaten down the hardest earlier on during the pandemic in the wake of positive vaccine news.

The positive vaccine news led analysts to raise their predictions for 2021 after Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN) each reported promising vaccine data in their clinical trial, raising hopes that an effective solution to the pandemic could roll out relatively soon. Fundstrat Managing Partner Tom Lee said in a note Monday he believed the S&P 500 would end 2020 at 3,800, implying another nearly 5% upside for the index. However, given the surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe, Jerome Powell tempered optimism. He said, “Recent news on the vaccine front is very positive for the medium term. For now, significant challenges and uncertainties remain, including timing, production and distribution, and efficacy across different groups.

According to Worldometer, as of Tuesday, there are 13,919,870 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. According to the same chart, 274,332 people have died from the virus in the U.S., and 8,222,879 have recovered so far. In the month of November alone, the US added more than 4 million cases, double the amount from October, according to the Johns Hopkins University. There were around 168,000 new cases reported Tuesday, with health officials expecting worse to come given the travel that took place during Thanksgiving in the US.

**Highlights**

* Zoom (ZM) reported way better-than-expected earnings but the market was not impressed, stock down more than 15% at the time of writing.
   * EPS of $0.99 vs $0.75 estimate 
   * Revenue of $777.2 million vs. $694.5 million estimate. Revenue is up 366.5% on a year-over-year basis.
* Zoom (ZM) rated by many reputable analysts as NEUTRAL or EQUAL-WEIGHT with price target very close to current levels. Seems analysts not expecting much from Zoom after earnings.
* U.S. airlines could receive $17 billion for four months of payroll support under a new $908 billion bipartisan Senate COVID-19 relief proposal, a spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner said Tuesday. We’ll keep you posted if there are any developments.
* Amazon (AMZN) is bringing its AWS cloud-services to the Macintosh operating system for the first time, allowing developers to create apps for iPhones, Macs, and other Apple (AAPL) devices
* Bank of America has officially joined other U.S. banking majors in refusing to finance oil and gas exploration in the pristine section of Alaska that President Trump last month opened to drilling for the first time ever.
* According to Adobe, Cyber Monday sales reached $10.84 billion, rising more than 15% year over year. That is at the low end of the 15% to 35% range the firm projected, but still makes it the largest online shopping day in U.S. history. Adobe now expects online sales to reach $184 billion for the holiday season as whole, down from a prior estimate of $189 billion.
* The total monthly sum bet legally on sports in the US likely topped $3 billion for the first time in October, according to analysts at Benchmark, citing state-level data, a new record. We particularly like DraftKings (DKNG) in this space.
* Kandi Technologies have been pulling back steeply after the publication of a negative report from Hindenburg Research, the same short seller that made allegations against Nikola in September. The company said it would investigate the allegations
* GrowGeneration (GRWG) target raised by Lake Street Capital from $28 to $40 BUY. This is one we love and frequently post about!!
* Starbucks (SBUX) target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $100 to $113 OVERWEIGHT.
* Square (SQ) target raise by Needham & Co. from $230 to $250 at BUY. Stock currently around $210s.
* Li Auto (
* LI) with huge target raise by Goldman Sachs (GS) from $20 to $60 at CONVICTION-BUY. Stock currently near $40, very bullish.
* Moderna (MRNA) with huge target raise by Argus from $88 to $200 at BUY. Company recently filed its COVID-vaccine with the FDA
* Micron Technology (MU) target raised by Keycorp from $70 to $74 at OVERWEIght. Stock currently around $65.

Went in with the usual picks to bottom feed - GOOG, AMZN, BMY, VZ and then picked up a few others like MTDR and ET as oil was crashing. Got bored of stocks and started lurking on WSB - then ramped into ZM calls and shares as it went from the $100s to the $200s, exited too early listening to you retards here that ZM was a shitty video conferencing app, lost money on SPY puts, and then joined PRPL gang in the high teens. Rode the wave up, then down, then back up to $30+ with Jan 21 17.50c's. Yes, people made money on PRPL by not being super retarded - thanks PRPL kings. 

Now sitting on a \~$575K gain as of today (deposited another $25K later on) with the following two big YOLO positions - plan to be above $1MM by YE if the chips fall the right way:

463,Coming Back to Electric Truck Player Hyliion (HYLN) - and DD,"Months ago, I treated Hyliion's former ticker as a big money-making swing trade on its ""IPO pop.""  I'm fortunate to have been in the same blockbuster event as [one Blake Denton](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jwu6sh/making_money_in_best_reverse_mergers_and_cramer/).

Now, I come back to HYLN, not with the aim of making money in the best reverse mergers, but with a small investment for the long term.

Without further adieu, DD follows.

**About Hyliion**

The company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:

> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.

**Investor Presentation**

As someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)

The company's Investor Presentation can be found on [their website's Investors page](https://investors.hyliion.com/overview/default.aspx).

As can be shown in the presentation:

1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.

2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.

3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a ""gas station.""

4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).

5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.

6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.

**Renewable Natural Gas**

[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:

> Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy & Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.

RNG production is expected to double in the near future.

Infrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.

**Battery Management Supply Chain**

Two years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.

**Financials**

Future-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:

2020: $1 million

2021: $8 million

2022: $344 million

2023: $1.0 billion

2024: $2.1 billion

Not every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).

**Values and Governance**

Hyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.

One of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.

**Stock Price Disadvantages**

Being an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.

While Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.

**Stock Price Advantages**

Even I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).

**Evaluation**

HYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.

466,Investing in enterprise platform companies,"Hi, recently did some light analysis of Zoom's new platform strategy. Decided to put this post together analyzing this enterprise platform strategy and highlighting some other companies that have done it well. Please let me know what you think and if you found the post valuable at all. Thanks

&#x200B;

**Zoom apps & the enterprise platform strategy:**

About a month ago, Zoom launched something interesting - they launched an app store!

The Zoom app marketplace allows 3rd party developers to build apps to be sold to customers through the marketplace. Zoom customers can then find and use these apps to enhance their Zoom experience.

From the Zoom press release:

>“Zapps\* help surface all the applications you need to be productive & enable the free flow of information between teams before, during or after the meeting”  
*\*Thankfully, after this press release, Zoom made the wise decision to change the name from Zapps to simply Zoom Apps.*

Many big companies have already launched apps on the Zoom marketplace:

* Slack have launched a Zoom integration that allows you to launch a Zoom meeting directly from a Slack channel.
* Hubspot have launched an app that allows you to automatically track Zoom meeting information in your Hubspot CRM such as number of attendees and attendee names.

While the idea of an enterprise company like Zoom launching an app store is definitely noteworthy**,** it’s actually nothing new. Enterprise app stores have been around for quite a while In fact, Salesforce’s App Exchange app store actually predates the Apple App Store by a year or two.

When executed correctly, this enterprise app store strategy (often called a ‘platform’ strategy) can create tremendous business value.

In this post, I'll explain the benefits of this platform strategy and list some exciting public companies using it to their advantage.

### The enterprise platform strategy

Before digging into the enterprise platform strategy, it’s important to note that there are many different types of software platforms. Two of the most common types of software platforms are technology platforms and computing platforms.

* Technology platform like AWS and Twilio allow developers to easily integrate with these platforms to perform a particular function. EG hosting a website on AWS.
* Computing platform like Google Android and Apple iOS allow developers to build and sell apps/tools through the computing platform’s app store. EG Candy Crush.

This post is focused on companies who employ a particular type of platform strategy; ***the enterprise platform strategy***. This strategy is in some ways a combination of a technology platform and a computing platform.

The enterprise platform strategy is when an enterprise/B2B software company provides 3rd party developers with tools to build apps and integrations which can then be used in conjunction with the platform company’s products. These apps and integrations are then sold through the platform company’s app store. This is very similar to the iOS app stores where a 3rd part developer might build a new mobile gaming app which users can purchase and use on their iPhone.

A good example is Salesforce’s AppExchange app store. There are thousands of apps and integrations that Salesforce customers can buy on AppExchange to be used in conjunction with Salesforce products. For example:

* The Hellosign Salesforce app allows customers to create, send and sign contracts all without having to leave the Salesforce CRM product.
* The Simple Survey Salesforce app allows you to create surveys to send to your customers all without having to leave Salesforce.
* The Translate.com Salesforce app makes it easy to translate customer requests from various languages into your company’s preferred language.

### Benefits of the enterprise platform strategy

Launching an enterprise app store is essentially a strategy of moving from a narrow software solution to a broader (and more valuable) platform.

When executed properly, a platform strategy can create the following big benefits for enterprise companies:

* **More revenue.** The first benefit is pretty straightforward. Much in the same way that Apple takes a % cut of all revenue from apps sold on its app store, the enterprise can take a cut of all app sales on their platform.
* **New customers and new markets.** A platform strategy provides opportunities for new customer acquisition in 2 ways:  

   * First, many of the apps/integrations that launch on an enterprise platform are big businesses in their own right. Big businesses with lots of customers. When they launch an integration on the platform, it is likely that a certain % of their customers will see big value in the integration and become customers of the platform company.
   * Secondly, many of the apps/integrations will fulfil the tail-end of “must-have” customer requirements that aren’t a core focus for the platform company. To use the previous Translate.com Salesforce app example, there may have been quite a few customers for whom the ability to translate tickets is a must-have requirement before using any CRM. It may have been years before Salesforce had the capacity to build internal translations functionality. But by launching a platform, they have allowed other companies to build apps which solve for these tail-end must-have requirements, thus converting more potential customers who otherwise would have used a different CRM tool.
* **Platform companies can focus more on core competencies.** One of the biggest questions any enterprise company faces is where to put resources? For many companies, there is huge pressure from big customers to solve a myriad of tail-end must-have requirements. But platform companies don’t have this problem. They can focus their efforts on their core strategy, building software that creates the most value for their full customer ecosystem.
* **Massive customer value creation.** Similar to the above point, a successfully executed platform strategy creates an almost exponential amount of value for customers. As the platform grows with more and more apps being added the amount of value and functionality available to customers grows with it. The platform company could never build the same amount of software on their own.
* **Stronger customer moat.** When customers buy and use apps through an enterprise app store, the platform company owns the relationship between the customer and the app. As customers adopt more and more apps, they become more heavily integrated with the platform company’s products. This increase product stickiness and makes it far more difficult for customers to switch to a competitor.

### What to look for in an enterprise platform company

Not all enterprise platforms are created equal. In fact, in an API-first world where most products can integrate with others, it is almost a default strategy for a SaaS company once they get to a particular size.

When analysing an enterprise platform company as a potential investment, here are some things to look out for:

* **Excellent developer tools.** An enterprise platform strategy is almost entirely dependant on the quality of apps built on the platform. If customers don’t use the apps, the platform is redundant. One of the most important things that a platform company can do to ensure that lots of high quality apps are built is to provide 3rd party developers with the right tools to build high-quality apps. Look for things like comprehensive documentation, visual app builders, easy to use APIs and a forum/community where 3rd party developers can collaborate and get help.  

   * For an example of a high quality developer ecosystem, look at Intercom.
* **Apps not integrations.** Many of the tools listed on an enterprise app store will be integrations between the enterprise’s products and another big company’s products. These integration typically allow you to send data back and forth between each tool. For example, the Intercom Salesforce app allows you to send customer data between both systems. While these integrations do provide a lot of value, a strong enterprise platform will also have lots of independent applications exclusively built for that platform. Independent applications mean that the platform ecosystem is big enough and healthy enough to sustain individual businesses being built on top of it.  

   * The Zendesk and Shopify platforms are great examples of platforms with lots of independent apps.
* **Reviews & Feedback.** To understand if an enterprise platform strategy is successful, you need to understand if customers are actively using (and getting value from) the apps on the enterprise app store. One simple way to do this is to just go to the app store and look around. If there are lots of apps with customer-provided reviews and feedback, then you are likely looking at an active, robust platform ecosystem.

### Enterprise platform companies

Below are some companies that are, in my opinion, executing the enterprise platform strategy very well and are therefore potential investment opportunities.

While a well-executed platform strategy doesn’t automatically make a company a good investment (it’s still important to analyse these companies in their entirety) , it definitely makes the company more attractive.

*(Please note, that this is not investment advice and just some companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio)*

#### Zendesk ($ZEN)

From an enterprise platform perspective, Zendesk is ticking all the right boxes. It has excellent developer tools, lots and lots of independent apps and a customer base that are heavily using the app platform (A large number of apps have over 500 reviews, which is very good for a business app in an enterprise app store).

One of the most interesting things about Zendesk’s app marketplace is how useful it has been for Zendesk in acquiring new customers and moving into new markets. It has also been really helpful for Zendesk customers who had to rapidly adapt to changes this year which occurred due to the Covid pandemic. From the Zendesk Q3 shareholder letter:

>*“In 2020, Cabify was faced with quickly moving its Excellence Support team of more than 200 agents to remote work, requiring new methods for tracking timesheets and productivity to sustain its KPIs. Support managers leveraged integrations from the Zendesk Marketplace to help bridge this transition.”*

#### Salesforce ($CRM)

You can’t talk about enterprise platforms without talking about Salesforce’s AppExchange. AppExchange (which has over 3000 individual apps) has driven a huge amount of business and shareholder value for Salesforce. 3 things stand out in particular about Salesforce’s platform play:

1. **The size of the companies built on the platform.** As discussed earlier, a strong enterprise platform will have lots of apps built exclusively for that platform (not just partner integrations). Salesforce has these apps in spades. The size of the businesses that have been built just on the Salesforce Platform is staggering. FinancialForce is an ERP software provider built on top of AppExchange which has raised over $186 million in funding. Billion dollar businesses are being built on top of Salesforce!
2. **Acquisition Opportunities.** Many of the companies that Salesforce has acquired over the years originally had apps available on AppExchange. This is a really intelligent strategy by Salesforce. Salesforce can look at the most popular AppExchange apps and acquire the ones with the most potential.
3. **What happens to Slack?** Salesforce recently announced that it will be acquiring Slack. It will be interesting to see how this is managed from a platform perspective. Slack also has a pretty robust enterprise app store. It will be interesting to see if this is folded into the AppExchange environment or if they are kept separate. My bet is on separate but this presents an interesting challenge to the ‘authority’ of the Salesforce platform.

#### Shopify ($Shop)

Shopify is a particularly interesting company to think about from a platform perspective since it essentially has 2 platforms. It is a platform for merchants to sell products to consumers. But it is also a platform where app developers can build and sell different applications to those merchants.

The Shopify app store is incredibly extensive with everything from fraud protection apps to search engine optimisation apps. The ecosystem is very active with lots of individual, standalone applications and many apps having over 3000 reviews.

#### Zoom ($ZM)

I can’t open this post by talking about Zoom without mentioning it as a potential investment target. Unfortunately, it’s a little early to say whether or not this strategy has been successful for Zoom. However, if successful it is a huge opportunity for the company to move from being a video conferencing solution to a broader, more valuable platform.

If you found this post valuable pease let me know below. Would be happy to post more.

I struggled a bit to identify a lot of software companies that have executed this strategy well. If you have any suggestions on companies that I should have included please let me know :) Would also be really interesting to hear of any companies who haven't used this strategy yet but who could be very successful if they did.

467,I just got in on the ABNB IPO via the Directed Shares for Hosts. How would you handle it?,"As the title states, as a long time host I jumped at the opportunity to get in at the IPO price pre-opening. 

How would /r/stocks handle it? Set a sell limit order? Hold long? Some combo of the two? [Proof\(?\)](https://imgur.com/a/7k0qjZm)

I am normally a buy and hold investor.

EDIT: Received an email overnight stating that my shares would show up in my MS account ""within 24 hours of the IPO date"" and if I would like to sell shares I need to call directly. 

So that sucks.

Full text of the email below. 

Thank you for participating in Airbnb’s Directed Share Program.

Should you have any account maintenance questions, or if you would like to sell shares, please contact your existing Financial Advisor. If this is a new relationship with Morgan Stanley, you can contact your new Financial Advisor team at (Redacted)

You can monitor your account online at Morgan Stanley Online going forward. Please use the Username and Password you established on the Directed Share Program website to access your account online. If you need to reset your password please click here.

You may only sell your shares by contacting your Financial Advisor team as noted above; you cannot sell shares on Morgan Stanley Online at this time.

The shares that you purchased in the Program will show in your new Morgan Stanley account within 24 hours of the IPO date.

**EDIT 2** I had to call and sit on hold for 20 minutes, but I ended up setting a sell Limit Order of $150, which was exercised almost immediately. So I made my initial investment back plus a small amount and have 18 free shares to let ride and see where it goes. 

For those who gave me grief for not going all in, all I can say is that everything I read in /r/stocks and /r/investing over the last week was fairly negative about ABNB as an investment and the IPO, including when I asked about doing this. I guess I wish all of the naysayers (about my paltry $2500 investment here) had something to say then.

Seeing as I am older than the average redditor, with a mortgage to pay and family to feed, I was not comfortable risking more than I did. 

Do I wish I had gone all in? Yes, of course. Am I happy with my outcome, yes.",2020-12-09 21:05:59

470,My dad actually subscribed to Motley Fool ~2 years ago. And has a 62% return so far.,"I don't have the exact dates of his purchases. I just divided his gains by his total portfolio. His portfolio consists entirely of MF stocks from their news letters.  He has never sold a single stock in his portfolio (even Luckin Coffee) nor has he traded positions. Basically just a simple buy and hold philosophy.

These are the companies he bought. So you can judge whether or not they're mostly long term  (\~5-10 year holds), or pump and dump stocks. I'm not subscribed to MF myself.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Short trading week, Thursday is a half day and Friday is closed in observance of Christmas. SPY gapping down pre market. I mentioned Friday in my chat room that judging by the choppy trading action in most individual stocks I thought the market was likely going to pull back some time and to be honest we need a pull back. If we pull back/base, it will allow prices in overbought stocks to come back down to more reasonable, cheaper prices and set up for new moves. We have broken the 9 and 20 ema's pre market. If we do pull back further, the 354 area is the first decent support. The 200 DMA is still at the 320 pivot level. I have 435 gaps on my list today, may be by far the biggest list of the year. My plan, be patient and take what the market gives. Good luck out there.

476,Help in Understanding Gamma Exposure (GEX)," 

Hey everyone, I’ve been working on calculating GEX for individual indexes and stocks, but have been struggling with a few things. Would really appreciate some help on these questions.

&#x200B;

1. When calculating GEX, why are calls +1 \* gamma \* OI etc and puts are -1\* gamma \* OI etc? I understand this from the technical gamma exposure side for the whole market, but logically I am struggling if GEX is meant to estimate Market Maker exposure. For instance for any extremely volatile stock such as ZM or TSLA that sees a gamma melt up occur because of purchasing of OTM calls, technically the GEX value (using 1 and -1) would be highly positive whereas MMs would be extremely net short gamma directly causing crazy volatility. Is there a better way to alter this formula in computing MM GEX? I was thinking to consider situations where put/call ratios are extremely low but am struggling on how to exactly use that in the calculation.
2. Does anyone have any advice or knowledge on how to best properly determine a volatility trigger - where the GEX flips from + to - or vice versa? I’ve tried just seeing where gamma flips from positive to negative using various hypothetical stock prices but have maintained the current gamma values for options. From a more mathematical standpoint, I’ve also worked on rederiving gamma for different prices using the IV of similar OTM options. Does anyone have any experience or recommendation on how to calculate the volatility triggers well as optimally adjusting gamma? 

Thanks for any input in advance.",2020-12-27 00:04:43
477,1 stock you wish you bought,"Hi all! Happy holidays!! Hope everyone is staying safe.

I wanted to see everyone’s ONE stock that they had a chance to buy but didn’t and choose a different stock instead and want to see what they learned from it.  

For example: MARCH 2020, I was in a dilemma of buying 1 AMZN at $1850 or ~4 TSLA at $460ish. I pulled the trigger on AMZN however missed the chance on TSLA. But I jumped on TSLA and still bought 4 around $1600 so still in the green. Lesson here for me is I should’ve paid more focus on the growth TSLA was having and should have gone with few TSLA at $460 rather than nothing.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

# Call Flow

[Call Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/f83491b0-fb16-4481-868d-66f471735f1d)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

[Put Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/2db2616e-dee9-4d7d-9fd9-b06fa35e645b)

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS', 'SKT', 'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Targeted Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&#x200B;

[Targeted Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/ed397f1f-09ef-4c3f-8746-e473ec94fb27)

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

487,Inflation + Stimulus = Buy Shipping (Discussion),"Hey team, Happy New Year! I made a 'professional' Reddit profile, but it's brand new so I can't post here, so plz excuse my older generic one.

Going to be a bit of a longer intro post, **BLUF: The absolute best place to be investing if you expect big stimulus and some degree of inflation is shipping. Including a YouTube link to a webinar I hosted in early-December and happy to answer Qs.**

**Background / Recent Trades:**

Here's some bio stuff so you know I'm not wasting your time.

* [Follow Twitter here](https://twitter.com/mintzmyer)
* [Seeking Alpha profile (14k follows)](https://seekingalpha.com/author/j-mintzmyer#regular_articles)
* [News article about our team](https://splash247.com/value-investors-edge-shipping-analysts-have-been-blown-out-of-the-water-year-after-year/)

I run an independent research shop that focuses on deep value investments, particularly the maritime shipping space? Remember #tankers? Floating storage and all that? Before $NAT and $FRO became wild stocks on YouTube, the trade was launched here:

[**Biggest Oil Price War Winner: Crude Tankers (13 March 2020)**](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4331589-biggest-oil-price-war-winner-crude-tankers)

Been writing on Seeking Alpha for 10 years (since Summer 2011) and launched our boutique research platform in mid-2015. We now have the largest research team in the sector and over 500 members and affiliates. Shipping is an exciting place to be, both for traders \*and\* investors.

More recently have any of you been on the restocking/containership trade? $CMRE $DAC $GSL $NMCI

**$NMCI has went from $0.80 to $4.41 in just over 3 months. 451% return in 3.5 months**. Move over $TSLA $ZM $PLTR and the dozens of arguably even worse ones like $CVNA $DASH $SNOW. There are fundamentally cheap names with the potential to move also...

So you know I'm not inflating, here's a full PDF of our original research post on all these names posted to [our research platform](https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_316) on 13 September 2020:

[**Link to PDF Report on Containerships (13 September 2020)**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqm5mjixp7qde1q/Containership%20Update%20-%2013%20September%202020.pdf?dl=0)

*I didn't take a single share off $NMCI until a very recent 20% trim at $4.44 as the position was becoming an inordinate part of my net wealth. These aren't theoretical or 'model' profits, particularly on that name. I admittedly exited $DAC far too early though... $CMRE has been a late bloomer, but those calls though!*

**Sector Thesis:**

I believe shipping is strongly positioned for 2021. Stimulus will further boost all the tailwinds already causing containership stocks to soar especially if Asian countries follow suit on their own projects! Furthermore, inflation will lead to surging asset valuations. These stocks are moderately levered, so assets surging means the equity grows 2-3x faster yet. Most of these names got destroyed in 2020 because common sense says ""Global Pandemic?! Sell Shipping!"" However, consensus was entirely wrong and several shipping sectors are earning record profits now and set to do even better in 2021.

**Discussion & Some Picks**

I'm reaching out to see if anyone is interested in any of these names and talking some shop.

Our top 2021 picks and model portfolios are up 16.4% in the past 7 days versus the Russell 2000 up 6.8%. I think we're just getting started, but of course we have to see what happens!

Sorry everyone- long post. Again, **TL;DR: The absolute best place to be investing if you expect big stimulus and some degree of inflation is shipping. Including a YouTube link to a webinar I hosted in early-December and happy to answer Qs:**

* [**Investing in Shipping Webinar Video (YouTube)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpB-b10RHAs)

Few ideas I've publicly mentioned (including reviews in that webinar):

* Danaos Corp (DAC)
* Dorian LPG (LPG)
* Flex LNG (FLNG)
* Navios Containerships (NMCI)

Let's Go!!! (note: mods, new poster, if I made any mistakes, I'm happy to edit, thanks!)

Note: I am personally long LPG, FLNG, and NMCI. I am both long and short TSLA in varying strikes. ",2021-01-08 21:49:29

After reading this sub, for fun, learning and curiosity I wanted to see what can I do with some stock data.

~~~~

**1.** I took data from some stocks for the last 6 months. 5min bars. Stocks are `""TSLA"", ""AAPL"", ""SHOP"", ""ETSY"", ""SQ"", ""ZM"", ""WIX"", ""BIGC"", ""MSFT"", ""AMZN"", ""GOOGL"", ""BB""`


**2.** I made charts to easily see some daily trends. Separate by day so I dont need to scroll left and right. Just wanted to see daily trends, nothing else. You can see charts here: https://tombohub.github.io/stock-charts/ ^wait ^few ^sec ^to ^load


**3.** Looking at charts I've noticed there are certain times where daily tops and bottoms are more often. I've pulled out all the daily tops and bottoms and their times of the day.

**4.** After playing with excel I've calculated what's the % share of each 5min daily tops and bottoms

**5.** To make charts I have removed first 15min and the last 15min because those were the most obvious extremes so I can see better stats in between.

**Results:**

There was unusual spike of daily bottoms at exact **13:30**, with big **2.45%** share (36 out of 1471)

Other findings are normal for the uptrend market.

491,I am so proud of this community and especially the mods with regards to the discussions around the current political landscape.,"While I know there might be many non Americans retards here, I'm sure the current political turmoil in the US has piqued the curiosities of many. Of course for Americans it's a surreal time.

/r/wallstreetbets is proudly a non political sub, as made very evident by Rule #5 :

>"" If you choose to start arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door. ""

Still, during the peak of the political shithousery, the mods created that thread to allow political discussions made me believe that the mods are not just robotic overlords that don't understand the needs of the average retard. I believe this demonstrated better leadership than many of our political overlords, and any /r/wallstreetbets mod running for office will have a vote from this retard.

Also looking at the discussion happening on that thread and even in other threads (such as the Daily Discussion ones), I was amazed at how civil, absolutely hilarious, and particularly autistic the discussion was. This reflects the values of our community, and I'm proud of each and every one of you.

I just wanted to make a post to congratulate the mods for doing an amazing work at managing a bunch of retards who sniff more crayons than an Elementary school teacher, and show my appreciation for my fellow retards who managed to find humor in the crazy times we live in.

I am proud to call myself a /r/wallstreetbets retard.

That's all I got.

492,Why I think Motley Fool is a legitimate resource for stock picking,"People accuse MF of pump and dump schemes, claiming that if they really were successful investors they would be keeping their information to themselves.   


1.  If you're invested in a company for the long term, sharing your DD makes it MORE LIKELY for your company to succeed. You get more people to invest in the company you own, the company gets more money to improve their bottom line, (marketing, hiring more engineers, obtaining more money for R&D etc...).  Which then encourages more people to invest in them.  

2. MF has been operating for the past \~30 years. If they really were operating a pump and dump scheme, they would've been ousted long ago.  

3. One of the MF founders interviewed Jack Bogle. During a segment they discussed that the more often you trade or sell stocks, the more likely you are to underperform the market. And they also found that if Warren Buffet never sold a single stock he would've been much wealthier today. Similarly MF found that if they never sold a single stock that they purchased, they also would've performed better. So they stopped adding when to sell stocks on their news letters. 

That's why long term investors like ARK and Motley Fool SHARE all of their research and purchases. When they do that, more people invest in their companies, those companies then have a better chance of getting an early advantage compared to their competitors, and so on.

Disclaimer: I'm not subscribed to Motley Fool, but my dad has for the past 2 years and his portfolio consists entirely of MF stocks. He bought SHOP and FSLY before they were 1/10 the value they are now. You can judge for yourself whether or not these are short term pump and dump stocks: ZNGA, LMND, SHOP, DIS, TEUM, CHWY, LKNCY, APPN, TER, ASML, CGC, ZM, ROKU, PLUG, FSLY.",2021-01-11 13:25:29

499,AAPL is planning a new ad-free podcasting subscription service to increase podcaster revenue. This could force SPOT’s hand to follow suit,"Good morning sun, good morning trees, good morning Apple...which is reportedly planning a new ad-free podcasting subscription service. 

Right now, podcasts are an adman’s game: Spotify and other top companies in the space, like Amazon and SiriusXM, spent the past few years “swallow[ing] up podcasting production firms in an effort to gain more control of the podcast ad market,” per The Information. 

Think: Stitcher, The Ringer, etc. 

Come back later: It could be bad timing for Spotify, which recently saw shares decline after analysts at Citi downgraded its stock because Spotify hasn’t shown “‘any material benefit’…from its $800 million-plus investment in podcasting content and tech,” per Variety. 

And, in theory, a major subscription service has the potential to yield more money for creators than the ads keeping them afloat now. 

Why it matters: This isn't the first ad-free subscription podcasting service, but Apple's deep pockets give it a better shot at disruption than smaller upstarts (looking at you, Luminary).

500,Cloud Based Stocks - Some thoughts on Moovly Media (TSXV: MVY),"Hey guys, I’ve recently been looking into the cloud-based stocks (due to continual covid lock downs) and think I found a winner in cloud-based video content creation - #MVY Moovly Media (I searched  this Canadian Investor subreddit, but found no threads on this stock, so thought I'd start one). That said, what are your favourites? I have my own reasons why I think these area’s will be hot, but a couple quotes that have confirmed my reasoning:  
   
 Cloud stocks are “one of the only durable growth markets out there right now.”  
 – RBC Capital Markets

This makes total sense. Due to COVID, everyone is moving away from the office and working remotely. Available/empty office space is increasing as people realize that they can be just as effective working “remotely”. This is changing the landscape of how people and teams work on projects. In a local office with a LAN (Local Area Network), teams could collaborate and work across your local network with ease. Working in teams now requires more cloud-based software and storage.

Also, according to Cisco “The digital video market is growing so fast that by 2022, just a little more than a year from now, 82% of all internet traffic will be video.”

I’ve been reading about Moovly media the past few weeks, as it has had increased volume and a spike in share price. See chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ln3zjqQV/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ln3zjqQV/) . On Friday the company announced a $0.10 financing ( [https://www.moovly.com/investors/moovly-arranges-non-brokered-private-placement](https://www.moovly.com/investors/moovly-arranges-non-brokered-private-placement) ), so I believe in the near term there could be a small dip in share price which will make for a great entry, and for me to add more. This video development software is a game changer and has already been vastly adopted by multi-billion dollar corporations – I just don’t think the market has really caught on to the revenue potential

A little info & DD on Moovly:

 Moovly streamlines video creation making it easy and low cost for users to create professional videos. As noted in the quotes above, internet traffic is focused on video – plain and simple. It will be imperative for all businesses to tell their story in video and not just text and picture as has been cheaply and easily done in the past. One main reason small businesses don’t focus on video is because it too expensive to hire a video designer. This is why Moovly is so important – a cloud-based video creation product that anyone can use to create and design video content. 

OVER 60% of ALL Fortune 1000 companies have some type of agreement with Moovly and are using Moovly’s product and service. This is a mind-blowing stat. To draw some comparisons, as WordPress is for cloud-based website creation, DocuSign ( #DOCU) for cloud-based legal documents, Zoom ( #ZM) for cloud-based video conferencing, RingCentral ( #RNG) for corporate cloud-based telecommunication.– Moovly ( #MVY) is the leader in cloud-based video creation - a simple but effective, professional plug-and-play solution that allows all users to create professional video all online.

Very simply put. If you want your product/service/business noticed, you will have to adopt video, or your business won’t survive. Everyone knows of YouTube, but I bet you didn’t know (neither did I) this stat I found from Forbes: “YouTube is not simply a website; it is a search engine. YouTube’s user-friendliness, combined with the soaring popularity of video content, has made it the second largest search engine behind Google. With 3 billion searches per month, YouTube’s search volume is larger than that of Bing, Yahoo, AOL and Ask.com combined. If YouTube’s user base were a country, it would be the third largest in the world.

Check out Moovly’s Investor page to see who their partners are and how incredible their software is. I believe the opportunity to buy stock this week during the private placement window presents a great opportunity. Of course after financings are complete, that is when companies often announce news and stock catalysts – I expect the same for #MVLY

501,If I believe that in the next 2 weeks we will become more optimistic about the resolution of the pandemic--what is the best YOLO play?,"I think there are a lot of catalysts that could cause things to look better within the next 2 weeks.  Maybe Biden's efforts to increase vaccination levels are fruitful.  Maybe J&J releases the results of its clinical trials and they are good.  Maybe we decide that you can space the Moderna/Pfizer second shots out for 3 months and all of a sudden we double the early vaccination rates.  

Assume that the outlook improves in the short term--what's the best play right now?  I am allergic to airline stocks so it can't be that.  

And while we are on the subject, GME, PLTR, BB, and anything Cathie Wood touches to the MOON with infinite rocket emojis!!!!!!",2021-01-24 16:58:26
502,Since everyone seems to be an expert on gamma squeezes...,"OP for this post is https://www.reddit.com/user/infinitelimits00/ and he posted this on r/options

Let’s talk about the reverse gamma squeeze (should also really be known as a charm-gamma squeeze)...plus this is an r/options sub anyways so might as well introduce charm.

So I see a lot of people think they know what a gamma squeeze is lately from GME. And yea what most people are saying is correct, but what they don’t understand is gamma works in two directions. The defining feature of any stock that has undergone a “true” gamma + short combo squeeze is that when it drops, it NEVER makes a V-shape recovery. See KODK, QS, HTZ, NKLA, TLRY from years ago, even BYND from years ago. I mostly like to go long stocks since stocks usually go up anyways, but I do like calling tops of stocks for fun (see my post history - I got QS exactly right and HTZ by 1 day, also got ZM and SNOW perfectly right in my comments history). I’m not calling the top for GME, but I just want to introduce the concept of what happens when a gamma squeeze fails, since the reverse is nasty.

So the gamma squeeze idea that most people have is say the next week the 100 GME call is like 20 delta (just estimating to make it easier). If some random person bought a 20 delta call from a MM, the MM will buy 20 shares to stay delta neutral and this happens over and over again over the course of the day, and the idea is this will cause the stock to skyrocket if enough people buy these calls. However, here’s the part that’s important. If some news came out or if just GME never moves much, those calls decay in delta, called charm. So those 20 delta calls -> 0 delta and the MM has to then SELL back those 20 shares, suppressing the stock. The delta of options change with time too, not only with underlying price.

That is one problem people never mention when they think gamma squeezes or an infinite cycle. But the other real issue is MM are already short ITM calls which they have like close to +100 shares hedged agains those short nearly 100 delta calls per option. If the stock ever dropped through these long call strikes, those calls go from nearly 100 delta at one point to < 50 delta, which means MM need to sell 50+ shares/options to keep delta neutral. They would keep selling more and more if it continues to drop and stays below those previously long strikes. That’s often times why the downside puts are so expensive on these names because MM also can’t blindly sell those, known a reverse gamma squeeze would cause these stocks to potentially go down 20% in a day.

Anyhow, I wanted to explain the reverse gamma squeeze since gamma is bidirectional. This is why when stocks that undergo this gamma + short squeeze rise and then suddenly drop, they NEVER recover. How many zig-zag recoveries have you seen in these stocks? That’s actually the defining feature of a stock that has undergone a gamma squeeze. It’s when it reverse gamma squeezes, it’s over. Good luck with your GME plays. Like I said, I like calling tops just for fun since it’s more interesting anyways. I’ve done it with a bunch of names in the past. I don’t really have a feel for GME, but the only thing I know is if it ever has a big down day, it’s most likely over and you’ll actually rather sell that day then baghold or buy the dip (which goes against the conventional thinking, but is actually the defining characteristic for true gamma squeeze stocks).",2021-01-24 19:58:44

# 22nd Century Group Expands VLN® Tobacco Growing Program to Support Anticipated Demand of the Company’s Reduced Nicotine Content Cigarettes

* [**XXII-3.0249%**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote?p=XXII)**More content below**

**22nd Century Group, IncJanuary 12, 2021**

*Company will significantly increase planting in the 2021 crop year*

WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., Jan. 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NYSE American: [XXII](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NWa3Asj0MLBcwKt8rICa6vM5KnIuHlJPWhj52MYEJ1PTaoUX5s7ZNlwlV5hn8WwtLp7zLU4dgDGzi2l3908szqBh053WkFCERZBerMeHxxQ=)), a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research, announced today that the Company will significantly expand its growing program for VLN® reduced nicotine content tobacco based on the Company’s latest sales projections. This new planting for VLN® tobacco is in addition to the Company’s sizeable inventory of VLN® tobacco, which is earmarked for the launch and initial sales of 22nd Century’s VLN® reduced nicotine content cigarettes. 22nd Century’s Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) application for VLN® cigarettes is currently in the final stage of review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Once authorization is granted, 22nd Century will begin marketing its VLN® cigarettes, which contain 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarette brands. Having the only combustible cigarette with a modified exposure claim authorized by the FDA could serve as a catalyst for 22nd Century’s commercial sales as capturing even a small fraction of U.S. tobacco sales could result in exponential growth in the Company’s revenues and market capitalization.  


“We are prepared to launch our VLN® cigarettes within 90 days after receiving marketing authorization from the FDA,” said James A. Mish, chief executive officer of 22nd Century Group. “There are more than 34 million smokers in the United States and research shows that a majority of these smokers are looking for alternatives. When shown samples of VLN®, 60 percent of adult smokers in our studies indicated an interest in using VLN® cigarettes. Additionally, in a 2019 U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [survey](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=69XZuUbIOAkQCUbHvqoftAMJZB9eiBi0R5KyC2EIvZsKscaHyVAnRk1F1-7536KMYFpqcxyK5uh0FtZmXt1Re4dguR-fAX31FDEj92JkI1KuO0rMoJ0Lo3pRd-onSgAzQoyGI2NBpDx4S1zgXAVyEw==), 80 percent of U.S. smokers favored reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes. We believe adult smokers will be very interested in VLN®, and this new crop of VLN® tobacco will help us to fulfill the expected demand based on our latest sales projections.”

Mish continues, “In addition to introducing VLN® to smokers in the U.S., we are absolutely committed to licensing our technology to every cigarette manufacturer, so that they can comply with the FDA’s plan to make all cigarettes non-addictive. We look forward to the tobacco industry joining our efforts to truly reduce the harm caused by smoking and protect future generations from ever becoming addicted to cigarettes.”

In partnership with select tobacco farmers, 22nd Century will plant this new VLN® tobacco throughout the U.S. tobacco belt, thereby creating a new income stream for America’s struggling family farmers. The Company’s proprietary, reduced nicotine content tobacco contains, on average, just 0.5 milligrams of nicotine per gram of tobacco - a remarkable reduction in nicotine versus conventional cigarette tobaccos which often contain 20 mg to 30 mg nicotine per gram of tobacco.

With 95 percent less nicotine than typical cigarettes, VLN® cigarettes will serve as a vanguard for the FDA’s ground-breaking [Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tnNwRK-zLbCaCqfJ57I0kHwZHCcIUPunks38X-k0P0ZOCtwu9fptg0rkCPhxdCDtgyVn3Z-PO4r4vHgtRiCX4X1mBo39v7rzln5zdlIhiL0W6AP60hCcIR8BFKfHslEoUtHaUPvtDg5zoKW7W_XbZdswAlHQSb60LTt1a15jiUHiKqxQj4VZ5oZl39zk_IxjRgJOTD63GbUtrm8vm31M2tg18JGQ7DDJkufqMrZ6DFvqt9wUHvfkoFpyIwpFsZ5k). Published in 2017, the plan aims to set a product standard for cigarettes that achieves “minimally or non-addictive” levels of nicotine. The FDA [projects](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=baYB9IGo-eQsUARAUwnigyCzft48_HRvQR53jhM7RXXh71gPcSQjiuDMw5L-132paAl2Rd87zki0PjAi7jgv9IYLTSe8KUToRVYaCHKIVRHo-pNwaoTrqaeAC-MRMtPM) that within the first year of implementing a mandate, it will help more than five million adult smokers to quit smoking and will save more than eight million American lives by the end of the century.

Within 90 days of the FDA’s authorization of its MRTP application, the Company plans to rollout VLN® King and VLN® Menthol King cigarettes to retail tobacco outlets in the U.S. The launch of VLN® will be paired with a compelling marketing campaign to introduce adult tobacco smokers to the world’s lowest nicotine content cigarette.

504,QSAM Biosciences Closes Series B Preferred Private Placement; $2.5 Million in New Capital to Fund Upcoming Clinical Trials," Austin, Texas, Jan. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [QSAM Biosciences Inc. ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xTL7tbqsOnP4Tt5JRJvNPnpC1U0MKtryRLaXzb6TmN_SQnDJTxZ1qGuPyJkr6SGBoVVkcOo2qPWSRXMg-YcuMi_aRJ75g9R12LZIFzoVnjo=)(OTCQB: QSAM), a company developing next-generation nuclear medicines for the treatment of cancer and related diseases, announced today the successful closing of its Series B Preferred Stock private placement in the amount of $2.5 million. The offering was led by Checkmate Capital Group, LLC (“Checkmate Capital”), an investment firm based in California focused on biotechnology investments and other technologies.

Proceeds from the Series B offering, which was over-subscribed, are expected to be used primarily to fund the Company’s upcoming clinical trials for its flagship drug candidate Samarium-153-DOTMP (aka CycloSam ® ). The Company expects to file its IND with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) later this quarter to commence Phase 1 trials shortly thereafter.

“We are very pleased with the overwhelming interest in our offering, the proceeds from which will go directly into advancing the development of CycloSam. We are focused on several important value creating milestones in 2021, including commencement of clinical trials for CycloSam for indications that include both primary bone cancer, such as osteosarcoma, and secondary bone cancers that metastasize from the breast, lung, prostate and other areas. This funding will go a long way towards achieving these and other strategic goals,” stated Douglas R. Baum, CEO and Co-Founder of QSAM.

“We are delighted to participate in this offering as a leading shareholder of QSAM. We have been impressed with the unique attributes of CycloSam’s radiologic cancer therapy, which, in animal studies, has demonstrated deep bone penetration followed by rapid exit of radioactive content from the body, as was reinforced by an FDA-approved, compassionate-use single human application,” commented Tom Paschall, CEO of Checkmate Capital. “We have been further impressed with QSAM’s team of experts in nuclear medicine as well as the leading oncology centers with which QSAM is partnered.”

The Series B preferred shares are convertible into an aggregate of approximately 16.6 million common shares and have voting rights alongside the common holders based on this conversion amount. Investors in the offering also received six-month, non-registered warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 5.8 million shares of common stock at $0.35 per share. For its early investment and efforts to support the funding, Checkmate Capital received a 12-month warrant for 475,000 shares at $0.45 per share.

The Company also announced that it has moved its official headquarters from Florida to Austin, Texas.

**About QSAM Biosciences:**

QSAM Bioscience, Inc. holds the worldwide license for CycloSam ® (Samaium-153 DOTMP), a clinical-stage novel radiopharmaceutical meant to treat different types of bone cancer and related diseases. QSAM’s initial technology is Samarium-153 DOTMP, aka CycloSam, a clinical-stage bone targeting radiopharmaceutical​ developed by IsoTherapeutics Group LLC, leaders in the nuclear medicine field who also developed FDA-approved and commercially available Quadramet ® (Samarium-153 EDTMP), indicated for pain palliation. IsoTherapeutics Group LLC assigned the CycloSam patents to its subsidiary, IGL Pharma, Inc.

CycloSam has already demonstrated preliminary safety and efficacy in animal studies and a single patient FDA-cleared successful human trial performed in 2020. This nuclear technology uses low specific activity Samarium-153 (resulting in far less europium) and DOTMP, a chelator which is believed to eliminate off-target migration and targets sites of high bone turnover making it an ideal agent to treat osteosarcoma or other bone metastases. Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor among children and adolescents. Because of its ability to deliver radiation to the skeletal system, it is also believed to be an effective agent to perform bone marrow ablation as pre-conditioning for bone marrow transplantation. This drug candidate utilizes an FDA-approved radioisotope combined with a novel chelant that has demonstrated increased efficacy and decreased side effects in animal models. Further, CycloSam utilizes a streamlined, just-in-time manufacturing process. Management believes these factors offer a strong pathway to commercialization.

CycloSam is cleared by the FDA under an investigator-initiated IND to commence human dosing immediately in patients with osteosarcoma and bone metastasis. CycloSam was also cleared by the FDA and successfully used under a single-patient IND to perform bone marrow ablation prior to allogenic marrow transplantation (BMA/T) in 2020.

505,"Emotional investing, lack of research & shilling","Hi there. I'm new to this sub as of last night. I appreciate that this post may not be welcome and I expect an influx of downvotes. My apologies if such a post breaks the rules.

**Emotional investing**

What's struck me since joining this sub is the sheer amount of emotional investing/lack of research. I say this based on the kinds of stocks people say they've invested in and are suggesting to others, despite poor company fundamentals. I make it a point to *always* do some basic research on a stock. I'm not saying that no posts here contain good research. Some indeed do. It just seems like there's an abundance of people who throw their spare cash into things without doing any research at all. That, or bots.

As an example, MLFB has been mentioned here a fair bit. [This](https://imgur.com/a/zmZr4wW) is what I see on the executive summary page of a well-known analysis tool for this stock. I'm not going to promote it, but I imagine many of you know its name.

Summarised:

* Earnings growth of 48.9% year-over-year
* Less than 1 year of cash runway remaining
* Highly volatile share price
* Substantial recent shareholder dilution
* Makes only $2,000 revenue
* **Negative shareholders equity**
* Does not have a meaningful market cap

Of the above, earnings growth is the only positive. All of the other listed things are huge red flags. Especially the negative shareholder equity. In other words, it's fundamentally not a good business.

Granted, you could say that a tool that analyses a company's reports and financial data can't realistically take *everything* into account. Especially something like upcoming regulation, or a change in laws. For instance, a company that grows marijuana would benefit hugely from the Biden administration legalising or decriminalising weed. That said, a fundamentally badly run business is still a bad business. In other words, a well-run competitor would be a better investment. Another example would be a SPAC, or IPO; there's insufficient data to analyse in these cases. At least for this particular tool.

I'm in no way promoting this tool. However, some details can be found [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lassx3/emotional_investing_lack_of_research_shilling/glptehp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

**Pumping**

I'm curious as to how prevalent pumping and dumping is here. This is the only reason I can logically think of for investing in a company that has poor fundamentals, or recommending it to others. Penny stocks are of course highly volatile. That and no-fee trading mean that it's theoretically possible at times to get in when a stock is crazy cheap, double your money and get out fast. That doesn't mean not researching stocks is a good idea, though. Nor does it make it okay to talk up a poorly-run company in the hopes of bumping the share price to help yourself get out of a poor investment. That approach is akin (in my eyes) to putting your money on a horse or a sporting event.

**Disclaimer**

**This is not an attack on this sub or its users. I'm genuinely curious as to why some people seem to invest in companies mentioned here, despite them looking like poor investments.**

I've only been investing for about a year in a serious way and I am by no means suggesting that people shouldn't invest, or that you have to spend a lot of money on a stock. I'm by no means wealthy, often invest £50 or less at a time and most of my positions fall into the £2/share or below category. What I am saying is that people who choose to do no research and just like the ""feel"" of a company may well be better of going to a casino. After all, the result may well often be the same. There are well-run companies out there who trade at $5 or less per share.

None of the above constitutes financial advice and I don't seriously encourage anyone to bet at a casino or gamble instead of investing.",2021-02-02 05:37:15

509,$TLRY and $APHA Merger Arbitrage,"
Currently Tilray and Aphria are being mispriced by the market assuming a deal goes through. I see the deal as very likely to happen. The conversion rate for Aphria shares into Tilray shares is 0.8381 which means for every Aphria share you own you get .8381 shares of Tilray. Right now, Tilray is trading around $63 per share. This means that theoretically Aphria should be worth around $52 at the close of the deal. Currently Aphria is trading at a 50% discount. Is the market assuming the deal won’t go through? Is Tilray only going up because of a short squeeze? Seems like a good opportunity for a pair trade at this crazy discount.

The deal is expected to close around March/April

After my first set of DD's conducted this year on [OZSC](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/l3qbwx/ozsc_investment_thesis_for_clean_energy_wave_and/), [SNPW](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lc7h16/a_biden_clean_energy_investment_poised_to_moon_in/), [SSFT](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ldba73/sonasoft_ssft_autonomous_ai_platform_company/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [ETFM](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lfsg80/etfm_covid19_smart_buildings_stock_under_001_oh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I am excited to share some diligence on $GMEV, an OTC penny stock that will be tapping into an **innovative mix of industries (hydroponics, vertical farming, sustainability)** for the next decade. I've decided to adopt a new format for easier reading, and I hope you will enjoy the diligence. I was particularly more excited to share because I was able to enter on this market-wide dip today.

As of 02/11/2021, here are the numbers before we dig in:

* Price per Share: **0.0085** (double zero's and under a penny)
* Market Cap: **$13M** (02/10/2021)
* Outstanding Shares: \~**1.4B**
* Volume: **\~154M** (1.6X the Avg. Volume, recent growth with PR)
   * 30-Day Avg. Volume: \~94M

Compared to a lot of the OTC pennies trading right now with billions of outstanding shares and skyrocketing market caps, **GMEV has their share structure in decent shape**. The recent increase in volume and attention will allow GMEV to scale its currently undervalued market cap at a pace that is well-aligned with its price per share. #Stonks.

# What is GMEV?

https://preview.redd.it/8xpj3ku9uxg61.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e7b9dcf7fec39be26acd9f0e15ffa0cd9911617

GME Innotainment aims to solve food production, plant growth/harvesting, and sustainability challenges through [Foundation Farms](https://www.foundationfarmscorporation.com/) and its **proprietary vertical farming technology**. GMEV aspires to support agriculture production at the highest quality and lowest environmental costs.

GMEV has gathered interest at the end of 2020 after the CEO of Foundation Farms announced the development of a new proprietary production system. **I got even more excited when I saw who was leading the charge.**

On December 9, 2020, Ed Kroeker was appointed to be the CEO of Foundation Farms in order to further expand Vertical Farming Systems across North America. Kroeker has considerable experience in organizing and overseeing the integration of engineering, design and manufacturing operations for technologies in the agricultural and environmental sectors. **This experience has also connected him with a number of small to medium sized manufacturing companies** throughout North America that offer **joint venture/purchase options** for Foundation Farms as the company **moves quickly towards manufacturing and assembling its own vertical farm technologies**.

Most recently, Mr. Kroeker has had experience working with cavitation technologies in other industries and has come to Foundation Farms, believing that adding a cavitation component to its systems could make the Vertical Farming Systems revolutionary in the industry.

# TLDR;

**With Ed Kroeker leading the charge in GMEV's vertical farming ventures (Foundation Farms), I am confident GMEV will build and scale a proprietary vertical farming production system that can potentially be bought out by a big agriculture company.**

Pure speculation and not necessary for my decision to invest, but GrowGeneration and Green Thumb Industries could be potential buyers in the next 2 years. Or another marijuana company that is aiming to become more vertically integrated like Tilray or Canopy Growth.

[GRWG \(+634&#37; since Aug. 10\) sells farming equipment for marijuana companies](https://preview.redd.it/c2rnqc1qyxg61.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=11a01a0d8f0ab8717d329a0a189b9d49f555c499)

I am convinced that the impact of [E-ROOTS technology](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foundation-farms-corp-shake-vertical-131800590.html) (scroll for more) on the profitability of the vertical farming industry will closely parallel the impact of LED lighting technology. LED lighting is focused on optimizing energy transmission to the plant tops and E-ROOTS optimizes energy transmission to the roots. **This innovation is critical, especially as marijuana growers look for more efficient ways to scale their production. Biden's presidency is also a huge plus here.**

I am NOT saying that cannabis is their route to growth -- **Foundation Farms is actually focused on a much bigger opportunity here: urban food supply constraints.** The real value prop for vertical farming systems is tackling issues in food supply -- this is a global problem as the human population has grown rapidly. However, the cannabis industry is a potential revenue stream and buy-out opportunity.

# What does GMEV do?

[Foundation Farms](https://www.foundationfarmscorporation.com/) plans to engage in **aeroponic urban farming**, employing the use of **vertical indoor growing units** for organic farming that is based on sustainable agriculture with non-genetically modified organisms. With the vertical indoor growing units' **small footprint and efficiency in scale**, GMEV can set them up in urban settings to help organizations meet urban fresh food supply challenges.

[Foundation Farms](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/gmev/news/Food-Supply-And-Security-Is-The-Driving-Force-For-The-Foundation-Farms-AeroPod-Production-Systems?id=261780) uses the proprietary technology that can produce these foods at locations **within minutes of where the consumer lives**; thereby, solving supply, security, and traceability issues in urban food supply. The technology embraces organic production methods that use **90% less water** than field production practices to produce the highest quality fruits and vegetables on a local basis. Consistent high-quality **production takes place year-round** with **no seasonal constraints or limitation**. The knowledge base that was developed within the technology uses proprietary practices to monitor and optimize nutritional content.

Compared to traditional soil-based growing, Foundation Farms plants:

* Produce 30% more yield
* Grow 3x Faster
* Use 90% less water
* Occupies less than 5% of the land required to grow the same amount of produce

[Foundation Farms is strategical positioned to drive innovation across the value chain](https://preview.redd.it/a97r3e7huxg61.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3bea2431d2f3f6cc52450bbb4884efab6a6702f)

* On Dec. 16, 2020, GMEV announced the development of a proprietary process called the **E-ROOTS process**, which will be incorporated into each vertical farm that is built, owned, and operated by Foundation Farms.
* E-ROOTS incorporates **patented hydrodynamic and ultrasonic cavitation equipment as the core technology** along with **air injection to enhance crop production** through natural root stimulation techniques.
   * The Yahoo Finance article has a more thorough analysis of the benefits of E-ROOTS.

01/26/21: [Foundation Farms Corp. Announces Lease of Warehouse Space for First Indoor Vertical Farm Installation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foundation-farms-corp-announces-lease-125300066.html)

* On January 26, 2021, GMEV announced the lease agreement for 2,000 square feet of a 15,000 square foot warehouse in Red Deer, Alberta, in order to build out its first indoor vertical farm.
* Plans for the use of the building include the **manufacture and assembly of future vertical farm units**. This will also provide GMEV with a regional product sales and distribution headquarters for the company's products.
* Ed Kroeker, CEO of Foundation Farms stated, ""We have an ambitious growth plan that includes the **deployment of numerous vertical farms throughout North America**. We also are assembling plans for **additional innovative agriculture ventures** that continue the theme of sustainability and local sourcing of food products for today's consumers. The ability to establish our E-ROOTS vertical farm alongside our new manufacturing and assembly plant provides the opportunity to leapfrog our growth.""
* **CATALYST**: Further details will be forthcoming shortly, but management expects the vertical farm to go into production **before the second half of 2021.** Kroeker is assembling plans for additional innovative agriculture ventures.

02/04/21: [Foundation Farms Corp., Issues Purchase Order For First Vertical Farm Installation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foundation-farms-corp-issues-purchase-123000190.html)

* On February 4, 2021, GMEV announced the issuance of a purchase order for the supply and installation of vertical farm equipment package for Foundation Farm's Red Deer location.
* [ZipGrow Inc.](https://zipgrow.com/) will supply Foundation Farms with its **hydroponic plant production system** that is marketed as ""the most established, successful and economical indoor vertical farming platform on earth"".
* When asked about the company's choice of suppliers for this first of many vertical farms, Ed Kroeker, CEO of Foundation Farms stated, ""As a company we are committed to becoming known as the best owner and operator in the vertical farming business sector. We have selected a basic grow technology that has commercially proven itself throughout all climatic and socio-economic zones. ZipGrow has supplied installations that are operating successfully in the far north, across southern Canada, throughout the continental United States and, more recently, in the Middle East. **The addition of our proprietary E-ROOTS system will catapult us forward as technology leaders** **in an industry where success is measured by** **profitability, superior product quality, and local consumer supply security**.""
* **CATALYST**: Installation and commissioning will be completed at the **beginning of the second quarter of 2021**. In the meantime, the company is reviewing **additional locations** for its vertical farms.

Given the pace that their PR team releases new information, it looks like they are following a cadence of at least once a month since Kroeker's hire. This is just speculation -- it could simply be based on new developments.

# Vertical Farming and Hydroponics is the Future

https://preview.redd.it/ipv5j4nncyg61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0b1c10f760dec4d7e85e07a7bbe35946d63d63d

**Advantages of Vertical Farming**

Having greater output from a small cultivation area is not the only advantage of vertical farming. [Following are some of the major benefits of vertical farming](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-you-should-know-about-vertical-farming-4144786):

* **Preparation for Future:** By 2050, around 68% of the world population is expected to live in urban areas, and the growing  population will lead to an increased demand for food. The efficient use of vertical farming may perhaps play a significant role in preparing for such a challenge. 
* **Increased And Year-Round Crop Production:** Vertical farming allows us to produce more crops from the same square footage of growing area. In fact, 1 acre of an indoor area offers equivalent production to at least 4-6 acres of outdoor capacity. According to an independent estimate, a 30-story building with a basal area of 5 acres can potentially produce an equivalent of 2,400 acres of conventional horizontal farming. Additionally, year-round crop production is possible in a controlled indoor environment which is completely controlled by vertical farming  technologies.
* **Less Use Of Water In Cultivation:** Vertical farming allows us to produce crops with 70% to 95% less water than required for normal cultivation.
* **Not Affected By Unfavorable Weather Conditions:** Crops in a field can be adversely affected by natural calamities such  as torrential rains, cyclones, flooding or severe droughts—events which are becoming increasingly common as a result of global warming. Indoor vertical farms are less likely to feel the brunt of the unfavorable  weather, providing greater certainty of harvest output throughout the year.
* **Increased Production of Organic Crops:** As crops are produced in a well-controlled indoor environment without the use of chemical pesticides, vertical farming allows us to grow  pesticide-free and organic crops. 
* **Human and Environmentally Friendly:** Indoor vertical farming can significantly lessen the occupational hazards  associated with traditional farming. Farmers are not exposed to hazards  related to heavy [farming equipment](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-is-agribusiness-2538209), diseases like malaria, poisonous chemicals and so on. As it does not  disturb animals and trees inland areas, it is good for biodiversity as well.

**Limitations of Vertical Farming**

Vertical farming has both pros and cons. Sometimes the pros of vertical farming are highlighted and not the cons. Following are the major limitations of vertical farming:

* **No Established Economics:** The financial feasibility of this new farming method [remains uncertain](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/02/indoor-urban-farms-called-wasteful-pie-sky). The financial situation is changing, however, as the industry matures and technologies improve. For example, New Jersey-based indoor-farming  startup Bowery [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/12/bowery-an-indoor-farming-startup-raises-90-million-more-including-to-counter-a-softbank-funded-rival/) in December 2018 that it had raised $90 million in fresh funding. In 2017, Plenty, a West Coast vertical grower, announced a $200 million investment from [Softbank](https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=ef3564e0-9781-11e9-81df-9f6d476a62df&url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxNy0wNy0xOS9zb2Z0YmFuay1zLXZpc2lvbi1mdW5kLWxlYWRzLTIwMC1taWxsaW9uLWJldC1vbi1pbmRvb3ItZmFybWluZw==).
* **Difficulties with Pollination:** Vertical farming takes place in a controlled environment without the presence of insects. As such, the pollination process needs to be done  manually, which will be labor intensive and costly.
* **Labor Costs:** As high as energy costs are in vertical farming, labor costs can be even higher due to their concentration in urban centers where wages are higher, as well as the need for more skilled labor. Automation in vertical farms, however, may lead to the need for fewer workers. Manual pollination may become one of the more labor-intensive functions in  vertical farms. 
* **Too Much Dependency on Technology:** The development of better technologies can always increase efficiency  and lessen costs. But the entire vertical farming is extremely dependent on various technologies for lighting, maintaining temperature, and humidity. Losing power for just a single day can prove very costly for a vertical farm. Many believe the technologies in use today are not ready  for mass adoption.

**Hydroponics and System Control**

Farmers can have total control over a hydroponic system. Hydroponics allows you to manage pH and nutrients to make sure plants are getting **the exact nutrients they need**. The systems are closed, recycling the water that is not used by plants. The ability to grow indoors allows farmers to **control temperatures and lighting schedules** to improve plant production. Systems can be designed to make use of **vertical space and increase planting density**. Hydroponics also allow us to create farms in locations where soil conditions are too poor to support farming, or space is limited and a farm otherwise couldn’t exist.

# Why I'm Excited

Although GMEV and Foundation Farms is innovating in the farming industry and leading our society to a more sustainable future, the **company has publicly barely touched on its potential future with the massive growth in the marijuana industry**. Hydroponics and vertical farming are the perfect match for fueling marijuana production as federal legalization is underway over the next decade. **My personal theory is that GMEV will scale its farming tech quickly in 2021, with a potential acquisition by a bigger agriculture company in the next 2-3 years for a big pay day**. Regardless of this theory, I am still bullish on the future of vertical farming and hydroponics.

I am NOT saying that cannabis is their route to growth -- **Foundation Farms is actually focused on a much bigger opportunity here: urban food supply constraints.** The real value prop for vertical farming systems is tackling issues in food supply -- this is a global problem as the human population has grown rapidly. However, the cannabis industry is a potential revenue stream and buy-out opportunity.

**This is the way.**

My position is 700K shares at $0.0081.

EDIT:

(1) 02/11: That’s... a lot of awards. Thanks to whoever dropped pennies on this post. Lol.

(2) 02/11: Wow, this really took off. Consider joining r/GMEV if you are an enthusiast/investor. New PR and news surrounding the vertical farming landscape will be shared here. I also have a Twitter (SmallGroupLLC) that shares a lot of updates on tickers I own.

512,Some valuations are absurd - I am going 10% short,"**Microsoft was a great company in 1999. It posted record revenues of $20bn, record net income of $8bn, and soared to a market cap of $615bn.**

**With that being said, if you had invested in Microsoft at the top of the dot com bubble you would not have seen a return on your investment until 2016.**

I believe we are now in the midst of a similar timeline. Some valuations are through the roof without any grounding in reality. It is hard to know when it will correct but I am convinced that at some point investors will once again begin valuing companies as the value of their future free cash flows + a risk premium.

For this reason I am adapting my personal investment strategy from 100% long to **110% long and -10% short** with some select picks.

I will be diversifying my shorts and limiting their initial notional value, wary of irrationality continuing. I expect this to be an investment strategy I can stick to for at least 1 year.

**I'd love to hear any contrarian views to my thesis and any thoughts on my short picks or suggestions.**

---

My picks (each will be -1% of my portfolio):

**1. TSLA** Not much needed to be said. Great company, love their products and direction. $800bn valuation is ludicrous.

**2. SHOP** $180bn valuation for $2.5bn revenue in 2020. 70% growth rate is great but where is my risk premium for my investment today?

**3. UBER** $113bn valuation with a -$22bn accumulated deficit. Gave up on self driving (their roadmap to profitability?) back in December. Propped up by SoftBank.

**4. ZM** $126bn valuation with $2bn TTM revenue and $400m net income. Guys, this is a company who offer video communication software. 0 MOAT or risk premium.

**5. SNOW** $85bn market cap, $489m TTM revenue and -$400m net income. For a data cloud service (hello have you heard of AWS/Azure/etc.?)

**6. DASH** $65bn market cap, $2bn revenue, -$200m net income. Financials aren't the most atrocious on this list but food delivery services (like ride sharing) are too location specific. No roadmap to global domination here.

**7. LMND** $10bn market cap for a ""tech"" insurance company with less than $100m revenue, -$100m net income. Their S-1 is filled with talk about their AI. Their ""chatbot AI"" on their website is a web form with a photo of a woman. Seriously?

--- 
Picks I am less bearish on but still considering going short.

**8. ABNB** $128bn market cap, $5bn revenue pre-covid. This one is hard for me. I like this company and think they have potential as a global business. Also a great pick post-covid. But I think $128bn is still too insane. Could be convinced otherwise.

**9. NIO** $94bn for the Chinese Tesla. Close to bankruptcy pre-2020 EV hype. Now has some momentum but $94bn worth? China growth can be scary though...

MSFT 468@$77.46

GOOG non voting 5@$746.06

GOOG voting 5@$766.53

ZM 20@$251.27

AAPL 40@$29.48

BABA 15@$80.82

SHOP 2@$904.81

BRK’B 10@$134.84

NOW 2@$402.82

WXIBF 6@$18.75

AWSHX 1021@$42.68

Equality roughing $210,000 all together. 
I also have 25,000 sitting in my cash account with my broker waiting to be invested. 

My question is this. I don’t plan on triggering any taxable events any time soon. I don’t have a really great job. I get by but I live modestly. I’m planning on retirement with this account. I’m long on everything. Is my 25000 in cash better spent in ETF’s and mutual funds or in individual stocks. My AWSHX has been a very steady earner for me, it seems like the way to go but I’m not the brightest crayon in the barrel, I’ve no problem admitting that. I don’t want to squander this 25k on high risk plays but I also don’t want it to not be utilized properly? What do y’all think, about the portfolio in general as well as the 25k to be invested. Any etfs in mind? And I know you’re not financial advisors blah blah blah lol",2021-02-14 01:58:09
514,Does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash is NOT coming anytime soon?,"I feel like there’s a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who’ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon

Is there anyone out there that thinks that won’t happen?

I can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. 

But we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they’re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they’re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?

Same with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can’t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). 

I know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion. The people who have been screeching “MaRkEt CrAsH iMmInent” are the ones that have been losing the most these last few years (by having large portions of their money uninvested in the midst of an incredible bull run)

With investors finally realizing the potential these tech companies have nowadays, and with tech companies making more money than what was once ever thought possible, does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash just.... won’t happen?",2021-02-14 09:01:42
515,NEW TRADERS: The internet is loaded with bad advice on buying individual stocks—your core portfolio should be built on old principles,"All I see in Reddit, Twitter, and social media is bad advice for the flood of new traders getting into the market right now. For every random post you see of someone claiming to have made a fortune on an individual stock, there are 40 people who tried and failed, and just didn’t post about it.

Most new traders see that the market is raging and think they can jump into investing and become rich in 3 months by just buying and selling off an initial $5k investment a few times. Here’s the reality: proper investing takes time (patience), discipline (holding), and work (research). For 90%+ of people, your best strategy is in ETFs.

For 100% of people, your best strategy is putting the core of your portfolio in ETFs. Your investments in individual stocks should ONLY be a supplement—ie buying high conviction, high upside plays that won’t damage your portfolio’s stability if you lose. The number of people out there who seem to think a portfolio with 50% PLTR is a legitimate investment strategy is extremely alarming, and they are going to end up losing a lot of money. Maybe not on that stock, but on one of them as they continue down that path.

If you want to invest, you should take the time to read John Bogle’s “little book of common sense investing” to understand why ETFs always beat 90%+ of investment strategies. Also everyone should read Benjamin Graham’s “Intelligent Investor”. If you don’t have time, why would you think you have time to invest?

The distilled version is that the market always broadly goes up in the long term, buying and holding a diversified s&p500 ETF with very low fees (like VOO) is the surest way to guarantee your fair share of returns. Almost everyone on this sub would have better returns over 30 years if they did nothing but that. But of course, that isn’t fun for people.

But know this—the market will come down from here. It is trading well above value. If your money is disproportionately in individual stocks, you have no guarantee of it coming back.

If you’re new to investing out at least 90% of your money in VOO and leave it alone. Forever. The rest you can take shots at individual stocks with. When you add money to your portfolio, add at least 50% to VOO and then with the left over you can buy individual stocks. Do this for AT LEAST a year, but 3 would be better.

If you’re experienced you don’t need me to tell you this but 60% of yours portfolio should still be in ETFs.

Good luck out there. I don’t know when it will come down, but it will.

EDIT: after some people calling me a “boomer” and questioning my selection, I’ll provide disclosures. It’s true that I do not own only ETFs. But I have been investing for a lot while. A bit over 60% of my portfolio is in ETFs or holding companies (BRKB)

Every year, financial tycoons pore over the magazine’s estimates of whose fortunes are up the most.

**Last year, the top 25 managers earned $32 billion** even as the economy crashed and markets wobbled. Over all, hedge funds [returned 11.6 percent](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/13QKTVm2uPAfg_7D8GmcXQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiFiTGP0TlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2hlZGdlLWZ1bmRzL2hlZGdlLWZ1bmRzLWNoYWxrLWRlY2FkZXMtYmVzdC1yZXR1cm5zLTIwMjAtaGZyP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTQmZW1jPWVkaXRfZGtfMjAyMTAyMjImaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9MjczNTgmbmw9ZGVhbGJvb2smcmVnaV9pZD0yNzAwMzExOSZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTUyMDk4JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD05MGI2YzMxZjRkZmJkMDQwNDhjNTk0MDA0YzMxZDg3ZlcDbnl0QgpgLcafM2BdAUw4Uh53aWxsaWFtY3VubmluZ2hhbTg0MEBnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAAA~) last year, according to Hedge Fund Research, their best performance in a decade but not enough to keep pace with the S&P 500, which was up 16 percent.

“It may not be seemly, but it remains fact,” the magazine’s editors wrote.

Here are the top earners, according to the list:

* **Izzy Englander** of Millennium Management, who earned an estimated $3.8 billion and whose flagship fund produced a 26 percent return.
* **Jim Simons** of Renaissance Technologies, who earned $2.6 billion and whose flagship generated a 76 percent return (but whose fund open to outside investors lost big).
* **Chase Coleman** of Tiger Global Management, who earned $2.5 billion and whose top fund returned 48 percent.
* **Ken Griffin** of Citadel, who earned $1.8 billion and whose main fund returned 24 percent.

517,"Daily Play, Yesterday it was better to go with the defensive play, today I will also have 2 picks in case market goes red, we must rotate sectors if there is correction"," 

The people on the forums, had their vote, there is  no need for me to wait a week, in just 1 day the reception of positive  by far outweighed any negatives, and for the Stock forum with 2.3  million members that felt my posts were spam, I am sorry to lose 2.3  million eye balls.   
 

 

**You can skip this  next paragraph and if you do not care about the thesis of why we may  want to go defensive. NEW traders should read this and don't be offended  think about why this is mentioned**  
 

 

Ok back to the task at hand. There are no if and's  about it, speculation and inflation have hit the markets. Historically  the SP trades at about 22x PE (Which means the average stock on the 500  Index trades at 22x what is made per share), at the moment with the  lovely inclusion of TSLA it is about 40. Yes, there are many other  indexes but this is widely regarded as the most important one. I read  many posts, and concerns about a correction, crash etc. I will say I do  not believe their will be a crash but a correction 10% dip off the top of the  SP is absolutely possible. How did this happen and why do I say that?  In my 26 years of trading I have never seen the market come off so hard  (Down 30% last March/April) and bounce back to record highs in months,  never! It can take 2-3 years. I contribute this to 0 commissions,  pandemic everyone at home, people can't go to casinos, easy access to  money/stimulus, GME AMC mania everyone wants to be rich quick. I am very  sorry to call out alot of new traders, I like to see people get  interested in the market and come in with open hands and want to learn. I  say welcome to the show. However I do not like the questions that are  constantly asked..... So, I am new to this, how long will it take me to  make 100,000 with 5,000.....I am thinking of quitting my job what do you  think......What stock would be good to take my life savings.... What is  the next GME/AMC......  
 

There is an old saying on Wall st.,if your barber  starts giving you stock picks, when your shoe shine person says to buy  bitcoin, usually that is a signal to be alert.   
 

When I have brand new traders trying to convince me  why NIO is worth $100, (43,000 cars sold in 2020, 7,000 cars sold in  January, Market CAP 90 Billion) while GM (8 Million cars sold 2020,  nearly 1 Million sold in January, Market CAP 70 Billion) something is  definitely wrong. Listen I love enthusiasm and I love new traders but  this is not a game or casino. I have traded 26 years and I still have a  W2, yes I do well, and trading has allowed me to have a business and own  rental property but I still have a W2, at least for 5 more years. You  should not treat this as a game and I recommend Index funds if you have a  small amount and do not want to day trade. Why not a mutual fund or  high flying ETF like ARK (Cathie Wood is a god!!) Because index funds  have the lowest fees and over time they return close to 8% without hefty  management fees/admin fees, the expense ratio isnt the only thing you  look at! Wait what? You mentioned Cathie Wood isnt a god? You don't like  ARK funds??? No, she has done well but ARK has been around for 6  years and before 2020 (When she was indeed hot) returned about 10%  annualized, which is good but doesnt cause someone like me to say she is  a rockstar, so you know her funds were down 9% yesterday, check the  facts. I mention this because her holdings are horrifying. Stocks that  did well have have insane PE's, SHOP (I like but last traded at 600), ZM  (I like but last traded under 200), SPOT (I never liked since IPO),  TSLA (You don't even want me to start), if she rotates who knows, but  all these stocks you are paying a very high premium for something that  may, or may not happen. So index funds it is! Now if you own these  stocks and your outlook is 1+ years and you want to call me names, thats  fine, they very well can be good plays long term, but for me I don't  pay premiums for anything past 52 weeks. Good luck if you do. So to sum  it up, the market is indeed frothy and don't quit your job if you are  new to this....index funds if you are going to be passive.

 

Now, yesterday my play was LDI, but if you read my  thesis and idea, I was going in at 22, some of you did or lower and made  a profit, kudos. I got in 1,000 shares (remember I still have 1,000 at  23.20 which I decided to hold Friday) I sold 500 shares at 22.25 but I  am still holding 500 from 22, 1000 from 23.20. Now I did get some  messages about this so I will go over this briefly. Please remember this  is not financial advice this is a play by play of an experienced day  trader. I am sorry if you read my post and wanted to go rogue and jump  in at the open, my post did say I was waiting for a pullback of 22. I  also mentioned clearly, remember these posts come out at 8am that there  is a chance we may need to go defensive if the market is red. That said,  lets look at LDI for people that think I steered them wrong.

RKT which I love reports Thursday and may also show a light on this sector, it is regarded as the industry leader.

The most important thig is this, so I will put it in bold, and is why I am not concerned at all about LDI.

 

**LDI as a whole has a  market cap of 1.3 billion (The company is worth 1.3 Billion) LDI last earned in profit last quarter was 547 million!!!!!! So the market values the entire company  for 1/3rd of what they made in just 3 months!! YES! Market isnt very  smart so I take advantage**  
 

 

That is not a typo, check the report. I am a day  trader but I tell you, if you got in at 23 you should have no concern. I  have 1,000 at 23.20 I am not worried, if you got in at 26 weeks ago, I  got a message like this, you should not be concerned and yes you can  average down and ""buy the dip"" Why? BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTALS SAY SO!!  NO, THIS ISNT GME OR AMC dont throw your life savings and average down  every pay check. LDI and RKT are absolute gold mines because they are  cash cows, how 33% of RKT is short absolutely blows my mind. Well,  Ultimate why are people so negative on RKT why is it short, how come  analysts hate it, exactly give me their job and pay me what I am worth!   
 

RKT will prove this again thursday and I will definitely trade it if it goes down to 20...I cashed out last week.

 

If you went defensive yesterday on ALL, you did  great it dipped under 103 and went as high as 106.27. I exited and  cashed out at 106 and 106.15.... Now this doesnt mean I am not bullish  and won't trade back in, I will look to trade again maybe at 104....if  it goes but that doesn't mean it will, no one controls the market.

 

So recap yesterday

LDI - In at 22 sold half 22.25 still own half at 22 (Also have shares at 23.20)

 

ALL - Cashed out yesterday at 106 and 106.15, Will look to buy on a pullback

 

Today will also have 1 defensive play in case the market is red... I am posting this about 7:30 AM

 

**RXT Rackspace**  
 

RXT reported last week and the report was mediocre  but got hammered on that report down over 20%.... Now some people will  say what are you doing to us, a company with bad earnings? No, this  wasnt the FSLY report or BA (1 of the top 5 worst ive seen in 26 years),  I said this report was mediocre. The company revised estimates to 95  cents to 1.05 slightly below 1.11 estimate. No this isnt good but the  stock was hammered and will have a below 20 or close PE. Remember before  how I said the SP trades at 22 and now near 40? This is way over done,  also RXT has been in business forever and just IPO'ed again, the company  that originally bought it years ago paid 4.4 Billion and now its at 4.2  Billion and the company is profitable.. So whats my plan.

 

Im looking to first enter on a dip maybe 19.75 to 20 but have to see what the market says at 9:30, I wont chase it I  will wait at least 5 minutes after 9:30 which is what I call the shake  out. I will look to sell at 2 different prices 25 cents to 1 dollar...  Thats my plan

 

**If we must go defensive**

 

**CAH Cardinal Health**

When the market corrects from previous history,  usually big money moves out of high tech and starts flooding to low PE,  Dividend stocks with -Beta. CAH trades at 7-8x PE has a 4% dividend and  is in healthcare. I have also been trading this back and forth because  the market just hates it!

 

I actually just cashed out days ago at 52.40.... I  am looking again if it dips and hoping to get in at 51 to 51.50 and  trade this for 75 cents to a dollar... Thats my plan

 

GOOD LUCK EVERYONE! Now remember this isnt me  telling you what to do, I am not getting compensated, please do not  blame me, these are trades I am about to make. If you do decide....

When the market corrects from previous history, usually big money moves out of high tech and starts flooding to low PE, Dividend stocks with -Beta. CAH trades at 7-8x PE has a 4% dividend and is in healthcare. I have also been trading this back and forth because the market just hates it!

I actually just cashed out days ago at 52.40.... I am looking again if it dips and hoping to get in at 51 to 51.50 and trade this for 75 cents to a dollar... Thats my plan

GOOD LUCK EVERYONE! Now remember this isnt me telling you what to do, I am not getting compensated, please do not blame me, these are trades I am about to make. If you do decide....

LETS MAKE MONEY!! BE CAUTIOUS INCREMENTS!",2021-02-23 07:11:17

520,$IMII – Inception Mining Inc. – A Profitable Gold-Mining Penny Stock??,"**Thesis:** $IMII is a ***profitable*** gold-mining company – rare for penny stocks (most don’t have any revenue let alone profit). Stock is very cheap at $0.05. 

**Bottom line:** *Will it go to the moon? No telling. But I'm much more comfortable holding IMII than some empty-shell, no-revenue, no-operation penny stocks out there that now trade in billions.*

*Like this analysis? - please Upvote! Confusing? Comment, and I will try to answer!*

Here’s a summary, followed below by details and links to check out. 

**-->** IMII actually mines gold (not wishy-washy exploration stuff) in Central America (Honduras). Mined 3,700 troy oz of gold in 2019, revenue was $5m.

**-->** Company is now profitable: $4.27m of net income in past 4 quarters. The next catalyst for the stock will be when the Q4-2020 quarterly report is released.

**-->** The stock started rising, but trades around $0.05 and $3.7m market cap – still tiny. Next target is $0.35 (2019 peak), eventually to $1.6 (2015 peak).

**Business**

Inception Mining, Inc. explores and mines gold deposits. It primarily holds interest in the Clavo Rico mine located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession in southern Honduras. Company produced approx. 3,700 ounces of “raw” gold (\~55% concentration) in 2019. This raw gold is then sold to refiners who produce gold bars and coins. Here’s the [2019 10K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1416090/000149315220009745/form10-ka.htm) (annual report).

**Profitability**

The company is profitable on operating basis, and turned significant net profit, $4.27m of net income in past 4 quarters. Here’s the [Q3-2020 10Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1416090/000149315220021592/form10-q.htm) (quarterly report).

The stock trades around 5 cents, which gives IMII only a $3.7m market cap – well below its revenue. It rose from $.02 2-3 weeks ago on high volume, which shows investor interest/conviction buying.

**ITAR ISSUANCE**

On 2/8/21, the company PR’ed that their application for Commodity Jurisdiction, often referred to as (ITAR), has been approved by the U.S. State Department. As an ITAR-registered company, DarkPulse has met the corporate procedures and control requirements for compliance to fully participate as an approved manufacturer and supplier for military, aerospace, and Homeland Security applications and programs. This significant development is in-line with their business model to provide highly accurate measuring devices into multiple industry sectors throughout the globe.

&#x200B;

**BOTDA TECHNOLOGY & HOW IT WORKS:**

Per Coscetta et al, to get information about the distribution of the BFS along the fiber, some form of modulation of the pump light is required. The three most relevant demodulation techniques for Brillouin sensing are:

the Brillouin Optical Time-Domain Analysis (BOTDA)

the Brillouin Optical Frequency-Domain Analysis (BOFDA)

the Brillouin Optical Correlation-Domain Analysis (BOCDA). 

&#x200B;

The technology that DarkPulse uses is BOTDA based. BOTDA makes use of a pulsed pump, therefore it strictly resembles the conventional optical time domain reflectometry. The spatial resolution, i.e., the capability to discriminate between the BFS in adjacent positions, is determined by the temporal width of the pulse injected into the fiber.

&#x200B;

**INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS:**

Using BOTDA sensors, Darkpulse is capable of providing a data stream of critical metrics for assessing the health and security of infrastructure for applications in:

\-Border Security (perimeter and structural surveillance)

\-Railroad

\-Oil and Gas (pipeline monitoring)

\-Aviation and Aerospace (aircraft structural components)

\-Mining safety

&#x200B;

**MINING:**

DLPS has a partnership with The Lowell Institute for Mineral Resources. DarkPulse has created a real time sensor system that can detect the location & movement of personnel and equipment throughout a mining operation.

In the context of mining safety, sensors can monitor: 

• Airflow, Air Quality, Temperature, Geo-Thermal Data, Seismic Events, Equipment Locationairflow monitoring and Material Distribution. • RFID, Voice/Data Communications, Video

DarkPulse technology permits monitoring of critical temperature, pressure, and strain measurements are made on a continuous basis throughout the Drill String, Casing, Wellhead and Production Trees. 

\-DPLS is a member of the The American Petroleum Institute. By membership in API Global Industry Services. “API members are committed to the API Energy Excellence program and enhancing the integrity of operations across the industry.” Of note, API's Pipeline Safety Management System (SMS) Assessment Program will be providing an overview of the program and its benefits at the u/ASSPGulfCoast Chapter virtual meeting on March 11. It’ll be interesting to see if they mention DPLS at all.

\-A recent tweet from the CEO of DPLS suggested he was working in the location of Kennar, LA. Notably, this which is where the NOLA airport is located and in close proximity to a number of off shore oil rigs run by major Gulf oil industry titans. 

&#x200B;

**WHY DARKPULSE BOTDA IS BETTER:**

Current uses of fiber optic distributed sensor technology have been limited to quasi-static, long-term structural health monitoring due to the time required to obtain the data and its poor precision. 

&#x200B;

Their patented DarkPulse (BOTDA) sensor technology enables the monitoring of highly dynamic environments due to its more than 200 times greater resolution and eight times greater accuracy coupled with industry leading data collection speeds of well below one second. The resulting high speed, real-time monitoring capabilities of a DarkPulse solution satisfy a broad range of existing and emerging requirements. This process results in low production cost with increased sensing capabilities that easily integrated with existing technology; making upgrades simple and cost effective. 

&#x200B;

**COMPARABLE TECHNOLOGIES:** 

NASA has patented the Distributed Rayleigh Scatter Sensor (DRFOSS) technology (US 6,545,760), which also provides strain sensing at many points along a sensing fiber. DRFOSS determines strain from scattering within the fiber itself as opposed to DFOSS, which relies on low reflectance fiber Bragg gratings.  Both DFOSS and DRFOSS offer new approaches to distributed strain sensing with much higher sensor counts than state-of-the-art systems.  

&#x200B;

DRFOSS technology is different from BOTDA because NASA's FOSS system uses changes in the wavelength of the light that's traveling through the fiber (primitive) but DPLS uses Brillouin scattering which measures changes in the magnetic field of the signal (more advanced and DPLS has their version patented) 

&#x200B;

**RECENT COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES:**

2/8/21- signed a commercial lease for an ISO9001; AS9100 certified electronics and electro-mechanical assembly facility for engineering and manufacturing of its hardware and software in Tempe Arizona.

2/1/21 – engagement of a professional graphics company to create marketing videos 

1/29/21 - Name change of patents to reflect better branding of the DarkPulse name.

1/14/21 – Announced engagement of a NY broker to assist in raising capital to be utilized for settlement of previous toxic debt, acquisitions and expansion of the Company’s operations.

&#x200B;

**CATALYSTS**

OTCQ uplisting in 2021

Q3 2021 profits to be reported for the first time

Q4 2021 contract announcements

&#x200B;

**FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:**

\-The Biden administration has committed itself to extensive state and national infrastructure improvements in an effort to revitalize the economy status post COVID thru a 1.9 TRILLION DOLLAR stimulus package.  Dark pulse may be uniquely situated to take advantage of structural sensor contracts in select fields

\-The oil industry is expected to begin ramping up production in Q2 2021 when Darkpulse is beginning to explore commercial opportunities and contracts. Their focus on the middle east indicates an awareness of growing oil and gas opportunities. 

\-The growing interest in green industries lends itself to structural monitoring of wind turbines, hydropower

&#x200B;

**INTERESTING TWEETS:**

Darkpulse’s CEO has a tendency to tweet and retweet extensively. This degree of communication is appreciated for corporate transparency and may foreshadow future activities/contracts. Examples of a couple interesting recent tweets:

\-2/1/21 retweet of Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency – scale up teams for disruptive technology, including grid modernization. 

\-2/25/21 tweet from Kennar, LA indicating that the CEO was working in the region. This is the location of NOLA airport and a number of nearby off short oil rigs

&#x200B;

**STRATEGY:**

Like all Pink Sheets, DPLS has high volatility due to low market cap and a high float. The company has faltered for a while because they lacked income and a marketable product until recently when research and development came to fruition.   This is a high risk-high reward opportunity to get in from the ground up on an emerging technology that may become an industry leader in structural safety. 

\-Recommend one of two strategies: buy and hold for at least a year OR flip on any PRs until successful product manufacturing or contract announcement, then just hold.  On small PRs, it will inevitably correct and you can buy back in near baseline support. On a major PR, this will never got back to current support levels.

\-Current level of support is .015-.019

\-Buy in under .020

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-2-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to drop after S&P 500′s best day since June

> * U.S. stock futures dipped Tuesday after starting March with a broad rally. Shaking off the late February rough patch, the S&P 500 on Monday gained 2.4% for its biggest one-day advance since June. Covid vaccine optimism and the 10-year Treasury yield off its one-year high spurred stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 603 points, or 2%. The Nasdaq, which shed 4.9% in last week’s tech sell-off, popped 3%. The Dow and Nasdaq had their best sessions since November.

*****

> # 2. Target, Kohl’s quarterly results beat estimates

> * Target on Tuesday exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, thanks to a strong holiday season and stimulus checks. Still, Target declined to provide a forecast for the year ahead, saying the pandemic has made it too difficult to predict consumer patterns. Target reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.67 per share on revenue of $28.34 billion, which jumped 21% year over year. Shares were little changed.

> * Shares of Kohl’s rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the department store chain Tuesday delivered adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.22 per share, more than double estimates. Revenue of $5.88 billion, which fell 10% year over year, was slightly better than expectations. Kohl’s said it sees sales growth in 2021.

*****

> # 3. Zoom Video shares surge after earnings, sales skyrocket

> * Shares of Zoom Video Communications rose 8% in Tuesday’s premarket, the morning after the company reported adjusted fourth-quarter profit of $1.22 per share, crushing estimates by 43 cents. Revenue surged 369% year-over-year to $882.5 million, also beating forecasts. Zoom, which became all the rage during Covid, issued an upbeat current quarter forecast in anticipation of millions of people and businesses continuing to use its video-calling platform.

*****

> # 4. Senate Democrats work on their version of Covid relief bill

> * Democrats’ hopes of including a federal minimum wage increase in their $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill seemed all but dead, four days after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian said the chamber’s rules prohibited its inclusion. Senate Democrats hope to unveil their version of the House-passed package and begin debate as early as Wednesday. Congressional leaders want to send President Joe Biden the measure by March 14, when a federal jobless benefits boost, approved in December’s aid measure, is set to expire.

*****

> # 5. Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduces a wealth tax

> * Sen. Elizabeth Warren revived the idea of a wealth tax, which was central to her failed bid to become the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who also ran unsuccessfully for president last year advocating a wealth tax, is among the co-sponsors for the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act. The bill, unveiled Monday, proposes a 2% annual tax on wealth ranging from $50 million to $1 billion and a 3% annual tax on wealth over $1 billion.

> # 4. Senate Democrats work on their version of Covid relief bill

> * Democrats’ hopes of including a federal minimum wage increase in their $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill seemed all but dead, four days after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian said the chamber’s rules prohibited its inclusion. Senate Democrats hope to unveil their version of the House-passed package and begin debate as early as Wednesday. Congressional leaders want to send President Joe Biden the measure by March 14, when a federal jobless benefits boost, approved in December’s aid measure, is set to expire.

> # 5. Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduces a wealth tax

> * Sen. Elizabeth Warren revived the idea of a wealth tax, which was central to her failed bid to become the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who also ran unsuccessfully for president last year advocating a wealth tax, is among the co-sponsors for the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act. The bill, unveiled Monday, proposes a 2% annual tax on wealth ranging from $50 million to $1 billion and a 3% annual tax on wealth over $1 billion.

Stocks retreated on Tuesday, pulling back after rallying yesterday, underscoring how volatile the market is right now. Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete \[economic\] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. 

Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March. 

In Washington D.C., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that the House of Representatives recently passed this week, though he did not specify when a vote would be held. 

**Highlights**

* Rocket Mortgage (RKT) soared over 70% today, sending the stock to record highs and continuing a dizzying rally in the last few days. Shares were even halted at one point today. In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, “RKT’s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock – GameStop Inc (GME). Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze. Both stocks also had/have relatively high short interest and high stock borrow rates which imply strong short-selling demand and limited stock borrow supply.""

* Rocket Mortgage (RKT) soared over 70% today, sending the stock to record highs and continuing a dizzying rally in the last few days. Shares were even halted at one point today. In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, “RKT’s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock – GameStop Inc (GME). Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze. Both stocks also had/have relatively high short interest and high stock borrow rates which imply strong short-selling demand and limited stock borrow supply.""
* After posting strong earnings and rising more than 8% after-hours yesterday, Zoom’s (ZM) stock price cratered today, with the stock going from 8% up to more than 9% down in today’s session.
* After posting disappointing earnings, NIO’s stock also cratered today, falling more than 12% in today’s session.
* After the recent controversies, Alibaba (BABA) co-founder Jack MA is now the fourth richest person in China, falling from first place. 
* In a memo to employees, Ant Group’s executive chairman Eric Jing said an IPO was still in the cards.
* Vizio Holdings, a maker of smart TVs, has filed for an IPO. The company has sold 82.2 million televisions and 11.8 million sound bars since its founding in 2002, the prospectus said.

532,Cathie Wood ArkInvest 03/02 | ARK ETFs Briefing | Buy Buy Buy,"Hello everyone. I'm DK.

Today's  stocks market have ups and downs, open high and go low, the three major indexes all have the desire to catch up, but they were finally dried down.

Recently, my friends who hold positions in technology stocks do not know if they are all right. DK is going to give everyone a heart massage, because DK still depends on how much technology, especially the enterprises with good performance ""master core technology"". The future must be dominated by big technology, and technology enterprises will continue to obtain low-cost funds from the market to expand their technical barriers so as to make more profits.

Today, Wood is crazy to increase the position of the day, DK calculated for you, Wood today increased a total of **120 stocks**, reduced the position of **15 stocks**. Let's take a look at the market capitalization of ARK's overall position today.

[The data comes from the ArkTracker App, Google play link at the end of the article.](https://preview.redd.it/vufw03rmtrk61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=435873ac14d70f0afe4320ea24e382307946556d)

Wood made a big increase in **$one (AONE)$** and **$Zoom (ZM)$** today.

[The data comes from the ArkTracker App, Google play link at the end of the article.](https://preview.redd.it/32676xl5urk61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=652b47eed395f77306f2981d518d60d7288cd93b)

**$one (AONE)$** mentioned in the article when Wood established its position that, as a shell company, it announced a merger with Markforged on February 24th. Markforged is a manufacturer engaged in 3D printing of metal and carbon fiber. Markforged was founded in 2013 to create a set of artificial intelligence AI-driven 3D printing platform Digital Forge, to address key vertical areas of professional applications (including industrial automation, aerospace, military and defense, space exploration, health and medical, automotive) to provide value to customers. The platform seamlessly combines accurate and reliable 3D printers with industrial-grade materials and cloud-based machine learning software to create a more flexible and agile supply chain for modern manufacturers while saving time and cost. So friends who are optimistic about the direction of 3D printing can keep a close eye on the dynamics of **$one (AONE)$**.

I believe that friends who often follow DK may have hit the bottom of **$one (AONE)$**, and we followed in the footsteps of Sister Wood to get on the earliest bus.

536,How to lose a year's gains in 1 month,,2021-03-08 14:56:34
537,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 8, 2021.","Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. 

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights

The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

539,Buy the dip growth candidates,"Hey y'all,

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT-mature growth

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up these past couple of years into what they are today,. What, in your eyes are those stocks and why? Sure they could still be SQ ROKU and SHOP and I will continue to add these on red days.

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

Notable mentions: CRWD, NET, ZM, LMND

In terms of value, I'd consider **BA, BRK-B**",2021-03-08 23:57:34

SO so many missed opportunities. I've been salty about W until GRWG rose to 60's from 3. It makes my 10K gains from 22.5K look bad, most of which were from one stock.

If you can't see the image for some reason, the stock in question are: grwg, se, tsla, W, nvax, cake, bpy. Almost all of which that I have owned for a short period or was serious considering buying but didn't do it for some reason. There's a few others stocks but these are the most notable ones. Other stocks I wanted and had were SAVE, LUV, CCL, DAL, IMAX.

I guess the point I have is that I listened to people too much and I overthought stocks. I may have sold stocks on emotions too. I also never expected for stocks to rise so high so fast. Yes, I still made money but nowhere near as much as I could have. I had multiple opportunities and I didn't take them. Now I'm stuck in a position where I don't want to buy anything because everything is crazy high.",2021-03-10 20:11:06
543,$ZOM sells first Truforma unit,"And Reddit rejoiced! That's right, the little vet tech penny that could has finally delivered its product into the hands of a real life vet:

**Zomedica ($ZOM)**, *""a veterinary health company creating point-of-care diagnostics products for dogs and cats, yesterday recorded the first veterinarian sale of TRUFORMA® and officially entered commercialization...""*

*""...The first official purchaser of a TRUFORMA® system was Jason Berg, DVM, DACVIM, founder and president of Guardian Veterinary Specialists, a 29,000-square-foot advanced emergency critical care and specialty hospital in Brewster, New York. A highly respected board-certified veterinary internist and neurologist, Dr. Berg’s dedication to advancing the field of veterinary medicine has garnered national and international recognition. ""*

It's satisfying to see a penny stock fulfill a promise and get its product across the finish line. While I remain skeptical of the long-term value of the stock, short-term this is an exciting milestone and good catalyst. $3, anyone?

link here:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zomedica-announces-first-commercial-sale-100000980.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zomedica-announces-first-commercial-sale-100000980.html)

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Lot's of people in the comments confused about what's happening to the stock and where it will head. Honestly, who knows. Biggest likely reasons for yesterday's bloodbath are 1) we're in a general period of volatility and there were LOTS of red stocks yesterday, and 2) many ZOM shareholders were planning to ""sell the news"" and take their profits when Truforma was officially released. Oddly, Zomedica decided to release early, with this one-unit announcement catching everyone off guard. Coupled with the rough stock day in general, this resulted in a profits-taking sell-off.

**So, our questions moving forward are:**

1. Is this the dip and its time to buy back in? (pre-market as I type is $1.99-2.01)
2. Was this ""early release"" part of a broader strategy or just sloppy? CEO Robert Cohen is generally well regarded, so I'm hoping its the former.
3. What's the insider and institutional ownership after the latest sell-off? Is the smart money invested in the potential of ZOM, or did it cash out on a fad?
4. What's the next catalyst? There are at least 2 other products in the pipeline: 

* **ZM-020**, a point-of-care platform for urine and fecal testing, and
* **ZM-017**, a canine cancer liquid biopsy platform.

**In summary,** there are lots of questions after yesterday, but also reasons to be optimistic. If there's one thing I've learned in the post-MEME stock, instant-gratification world, the long view of shareholding is now a foreign concept to many. For me? I'm buying the dip and will continue to hold as I think there's more profit to be had. I'm no financial adviser, so you need to do your own DD and understand your risk tolerance.

I held ZM and SQ, but sold off TDOC and a lot of other COVID plays last month because I feel like regardless how good the earnings and news on the company, when good Vaccine news and reopening chatter happens it absolutely destroys the stock price of these companies. Question is, do you feel summertime will be prime for getting back into these plays ahead of potential COVID spikes in the Fall, or just long term success for these companies at a cheap price even if no spikes in Fall?

545,Applying Occum's razor to the stock market,"Looking back at the last year on the stock market, I see a bubble. Many people on this forum confidently proclaim that there wont be another crash anytime soon And that buying this dip is the correct thing to do. That leaves us with 2 possible scenarios.

1st scenario, were in a humongous bubble based on the valuations pre-covid to current valuations and it is currently in the beginning of a major crash. 2000 dotcom crash charts almost perfectly match our current charts.

2nd scenario, pre-covid the entire market was wrong on the valuations for the past several years on stocks.  During the pandemic, the public and institutions became lucid to the fact that tech, gambling, weed, ev, ecommerce, btc miners, chinese stocks etc  were all wildly undervalued and so the market rightly corrected for this 200% - 1000% deficiency in market cap over the past year. Sub 10 P/E ratios were also wrong and P/E of 30 - 170 is appropriate for the first time in history.

Occams razor, the simplest explanation is usually the right answer.

Am i to believe that the market was wildly wrong in undervaluing stocks like zm, shop, aapl, tsla, BLNK, DKNG, PENN, TLRY etc over the last several years? What does everyone think?

I will be very patient today and wait for solid setups or I won't trade. Not every day is a good day to trade and cash is a position. Some times it's best to wait out the open to see if stocks can find direction. The caveat to this is that we may miss good trades at the open. Best to miss trades some days than to get chopped up and lose. Good luck trading

Imagine a world where you can get cheaper and healthier meat, any way that you like it.

Cultured Meat, Plant-based meat are starting to gain momentum and acceptance in society, with country like Singapore approving lab-grown meat, to MacDonalds and KFC's interest in it. 

The market size for cultured meat is expected to be exceptional in the future. 

It is without a doubt that in this rapidly populating and overcrowding Earth, we have to look for an alternative over the current **cruel, land & resources-consuming** and **environmental-damaging** way. 

Some may argue that this is 'unnatural' but is this considered as natural? 

https://preview.redd.it/3ukn7p9e2tn61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f18eea5e2fdcd27c3eb971581f81f4dcdb1c86c3

 

**Cultured meat has several advantages over conventionally-harvested meat**:

* *Environmental:* At least 18% of the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere today are from the livestock industry. Research shows that the expected environmental footprint of cultured meat includes approximately 78% to 96% fewer greenhouse gas emissions, 99% less land use, 82% to 96% less water use, and 7% to 45% less energy use than conventionally-produced beef, lamb, pork and poultry. This suggests that the environmental consequences of switching from large-scale, factory farming to lab-grown cultured meat could have a long-term positive impact on the environment.
* *Cost:* While the precise economic value of harvested cells has yet to be determined, the potential to harvest large numbers of cells from a small number of live donor animals gives rise to the possibility of considerably higher returns than traditional agriculture, with production cycles potentially measured in months, rather than years. By comparison, raising a cow for slaughter generally takes an average of 18 months, over which period 15,400 liters of water and 7 kilograms of feed will be consumed for every kilogram of beef produced.
* *Animal Suffering:* More and more people are grappling with the ethical question of whether humanity should continue to slaughter animals for food. There is a growing trend of opposition to the way animals are raised for slaughter, often in small, confined spaces with unnatural feeding patterns. In many cases, such animals suffer terribly throughout their lives. This consideration is likely a factor in many consumers choosing to incorporate more flexitarian, vegetarian and vegan approaches to their diets in recent years.
* *Controlled Growing Environment:* Another potential benefit of cultured meat is that its growth environment is designed to be less susceptible to biological risk and disease, through standardized, tailored production methods consistent with good manufacturing practice, or GMP, controls to contribute to improved nutrition, health and wellbeing.
* *Alternate Use of Natural Resources:* Eight percent of the world’s freshwater supply and one third of croplands are currently used to provide for livestock. The development of cultured meat is expected to free up many of these natural resources, especially in developing economies where they are most needed.
* *Food Waste:* The conventional meat industry’s largest waste management problem relates to the disposal of partially-used carcasses, which are usually buried, incinerated, rendered or composted, with attendant problems such as land, water or air pollution. Cultured meat offers a potential solution for this problem, with only the desired cuts of meat being produced for consumption and only minimal waste product generated, with no leftover carcass.

* Cultured meat will be the consumer acceptance as the alternative protein choice, not plant-based. 
* No potential competitor yet, that is focusing on complex, bioprinted high-value red meats, such as steak.
* The following table shows the mapping of some companies that we know to operate in the field of conventional meat substitutes, distinguishing between vegetable meat substitutes and real cultured meat, as well as between 3D-printing and non-printing technologies, with **only the 3d Printed meat providing high-resolution control needed for premium, structured products with specific shape and texture.**

**Company Strategy**

To achieve our mission, we intend to:

***Perfect the development of our cultured steak manufacturing technology and processes***.  We intend to continue developing and refining our processes, procedures and equipment until we are in a position to initiate out-licensing of our technology.  We currently aim to print 100 grams of structured, edible, cultured meat, similar in taste, appearance, smell and texture to steak, consisting of cells bred in our laboratory and developed into fat, muscle and connective tissue using our three-dimensional printing technology, by the end of 2021.  Upon satisfaction of this milestone, we plan to tackle the technological challenges involved in scaling up the printing process to industrial-scale levels before seeking potential licensees.

***Launch our B2B product solution for companies in the food industry***.  We intend to license our production technology as well as provide associated products, such as cell lines, printheads, bioreactors and incubators, and services, such as technology implementation, training, and engineering support,  whether directly or through contractors, to food processing and food retail companies.  We intend to charge our customers a production license fee, based upon the amount of meat printed. We expect that each production facility will periodically require us to provide them with our proprietary materials, such as fresh sets of starter cells. We intend to charge a fee for such restocking, employing a cost-plus pricing model. In addition, other materials used in the production process, such as cell-culture media and additives in our bio-inks may be sourced from third parties. Whether these materials are customized for the specifics of our production processes, or ‘white-labelled’ generic materials, or proprietary materials that we have developed, we may charge a fee for restocking such materials with a cost-plus pricing model, however we have not yet reached the stage where it would be possible to estimate to what extent this would contribute to any future revenue stream. Finally, we intend to provide paid product implementation and guidance services to our customers looking to establish cultured meat manufacturing facilities. We expect that each facility licensing our technologies will need to deal with novel challenges and, as a result, will require the assistance of our expert knowledge in order to set up and implement the licensed technologies.

***Develop additional alternative proteins, such as poultry, to meet growing industry demand***. There are substantial technological challenges inherent in expanding our offering beyond cultured beef technologies to additional alternative proteins, such as cultured poultry or cultured fish.  However, we believe that our experience, know-how and intellectual property portfolio form an excellent basis from which to surmount such challenges. In February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Peace of Meat, with the aim of developing avian meat for the alternative meat industry, applying proprietary technology to mimic the cellular composition of conventional poultry.

***Acquire synergistic and complementary technologies and assets***.  We intend to optimize our processes and diversify our product range to expand the cultured meat technologies upon which marketable products can be based, through a combination of internal development, acquisitions and collaborations, with a view to complementing our own processes and diversifying our product range along the cultured meat production value chain in order to introduce cultured products to the global market as quickly as possible. See also “- Additional Technologies”.

&#x200B;

The company aim to have their products ready by 2022, and is accelerating their pace of growth. It is only in a matter of time before this stock explodes. I'm highly convicted in it, and I hope you can join me on this exciting journey :)!",2021-03-18 11:37:35
548,BNGO Earnings Likely Outcomes (could b wrong)," 

Using the 3.8-4.2M dollar preliminary estimate from Erik and the BNGO team, I was able (I think lol unless I forgot or missed something, comment below if I screwed something up) to estimate and label the probabilities (imo) of each tier's exact EPS coming to fruition.

TLDR - IN MY OPINION, BNGO earnings, based primarily but not solely on the revenue estimates Erik (BNGO CEO) gave in a recent presentation, are extremely likely to beat the $-0.07 eps estimate from marketbeat, and a very likely chance to beat the $-0.05 eps estimate from yahoo average estimate.

DISCLAIMER (just give it a skim especially if you catch something I missed/neglected when making the calculations) - Please before saying this or that is wrong, please read this or at least skim it - I can easily be wrong about my calculations because I could have missed something. ALSO, I DID NOT SAY THIS IN THE VIDEO BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT - The total expenses I choose for all 5 tiers were basically just guesses going from unlikely (in a bearish way) to being fair to being unlikely (in a bullish way) basically. Because of this, THE EXACT EPS ESTIMATES I HAVE MADE ARE NOT IMPLYING THAT I THINK BNGO EARNINGS WILL ONLY BE 1 OF THEM EXACTLY ON THE CENT. It just means that that ones with the higher % chance I labeled them with will mean that for BNGO earnings, there is a higher chance actual EPS will turn out to be near or exactly in one of the tiers with higher chances in my opinion. It would have maybe been better to have a bit of a range of EPS estimates but that is more complicated because then I would have to do more total expenses guestimations and for a range I do not know exactly how that would have worked. I know this may seem complex and I could be wrong but I think based on this research that BNGO (as stated in video) has a higher change of beating earnings than missing in my opinion.

This below is what I typed in a google doc and presented/explained on my youtube channel link to the video here - [I Calculated Several BNGO Earnings Possibilities, What I Think (maybe) I Found Is Very Interesting - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e1P0IJXzAo)

If just reading some things will seem a little out of place like the 'IF \_\_\_\_ IS NOT TRUE' part right near the top. But all in all I will just attempt to sum it up here articulately.

I assumed for all net income calculations that revenue is 4M (average of preliminary estimates in Erik's presentation) and for the total expenses (variable that changes in each 5 tiers) I started with the worst case scenario (in my mind, but technically speaking they could have a much higher total expenses than what I assumed, in my assumptions I did a number which was more than double the average quarterly total expenses from 2017-2019 average and in this of course you actually want if you are a bull, to have lower total expenses, so that is why I doubled instead of halved) and moved up to more optimistic total expense number (lower) or revenue (higher) as long as it is the same proportion if that makes any sense. I think it will make more sense and before we get into it realize this formula if you do not already know (Net income) - (Preferred dividends) = (Net proceeds) Divided by (Shares Outstanding) = Basic EPS

and if the format looks weird it is because it is originally in google doc form but I copy and pasted it here

**PRESENTING ALL MY EVIDENCE AND SITES THAT I USED FOR ALL OF THIS AFTER GOING OVER ESTIMATES. I WILL LINK ALL WEBSITES AND INFO USED TO CALCULATE MY ESTIMATES IN DESCRIPTION AND PIN IT IN THE COMMENTS.**

**EPS ESTIMATE BY WALL ST. ANALYSTS IS $-0.07**

Net income = profit of business after deducting expenses

IF \_\_\_\_ IS NOT TRUE THEN MY ESTIMATES WILL 100% BE WAY OFF

**EVEN WITH ALL THIS SAID I DO NOT THINK I AM BEING OVERLY OR UNFAIRLY OPTIMISTIC IN ANY TIER RELATIVE TO THE LABEL (unfairly bearish, conservative, fair, optimistic, unfairly bullish)**

**5 estimates**

((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATE)

$-3M (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $-3M (Net proceeds) $-3M (Net proceeds)Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

FIVE

(((CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED IMO) UNFAIRLY BULLISH ESTIMATE)

$2m (Net income) - 0 (Preferred dividends) = $2M (Net proceeds) $2M (Net proceeds)Divided by $153.19M (Shares Outstanding) =

EPS OF $0.0130556825 OR 1 Cent

(BEATS EPS ESTIMATE ($-0.07) BY $0.08)

(BEATS Q3 2020 BY $.10)

BEATS Q4 2019 BY $0.28)

% CHANCE IMO -- 13%

2019 Q4 EPS was $-0.27

2020 Q3 was $-0.09

VERY likely that BNGO has doubled revenue in Q4. This means that -

Net income = profit of business after deducting expenses

There is no way of knowing BNGO’s Net income in Q4 but looking historically at net income increases and movements and looking at yahoo finance’s TTM total expenses stat, I am assuming that it has not risen more than 5-20% (I am comparing to ¼ of 2019 total expenses according to yahoo finance)

2020 Q3 net income -$10.8M

Shares outstanding for 2020 Q4 is $153.19M

Net income - Preferred dividends = Net Proceeds/Shares Outstanding = EPS

Important factors I considered when estimating net incomes for each tier - Acquisition of Lineagen (was acquired August 24th 2020), Earnings date was not delayed, Big money has not been selling out (to our knowledge (retail investors information)) prior to earnings, **EVEN WITH ALL THIS SAID I DO NOT THINK I AM BEING OVERLY OR UNFAIRLY OPTIMISTIC IN ANY TIER RELATIVE TO THE LABEL (unfairly bearish, conservative, fair, optimistic, unfairly bullish**

549,"Your Mom's Game Plan for March 24, 2021","**Good morning, here's some stocks to watch and trade:** 

**Gap Ups:** AMAT, AMTX, APTO, ASML, AUVI, BNGO, DLPN, FNKO, HOFV, HOME, INTC, IPHI, PLBY, PTON, ROOT, ZKIN, ZM

**Gap Downs:** GIS, GME, GNOG, HTHT, PLL, TKAT, TSM, VIAC

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY neutral pre market after another sell off day yesterday. Powell and Yellen continue their testimony today so probably more of the same choppy action. Overall trading action intraday has actually been fairly nice with some great moves if you are shorting, but the volume is very low at the open and the spreads are huge, not ideal if you are trying to manage risk. We should see more of this same action today as the IWM and the QQQ are now both under their 50 day moving averages. SPY still trying to grind higher but has room to decline to major moving averages again if we see continued selling pressure. If you are new to trading, these days can be tougher than other days so it would be wise to trade less or risk less and maybe even choose not to trade. We can trade every day but every day is not a good day to trade. It is up to us as professionals to identify where our edge lies and when to be more or less aggressive. Cash is also a position. I'll be focusing on earnings plays and 2nd day plays. Good luck trading.

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-friday-march-26.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday’s tech rout

> * Dow and S&P 500 futures Friday added to Thursday’s late-session comeback, which saw Wall Street break a two-day losing streak, putting the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 at about breakeven for the week. The Dow closed up 199 points, boosted by economic comeback stocks, after losing as much as 348 points earlier Thursday. Nasdaq futures turned lower Friday after the index closed slightly higher. However, it remained 1.8% lower for the week. The 10-year Treasury yield was up Friday but still below recent 14-month highs.

> * The Commerce Department is out with personal income and spending figures for February at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect an income drop of 7%. Spending is also seen dropping by 0.8%. In January, income jumped 10%, its biggest monthly gain since April, as Americans received stimulus checks approved in December. Spending in January increased by 2.4%. In the coming months, another round of stimulus checks, approved in March, could start showing up in the data.

*****

> # 2. Office-sharing company WeWork signs new deal to go public

> * WeWork, which pulled its IPO in 2019 after a dwindling valuation and resignation of co-founder Adam Neumann, has reached a new deal to go public. The office-sharing company agreed on Friday to merge with special purpose acquisition company BowX Acquisition Corp. The transaction values WeWork at $9 billion, a fraction of its one-time valuation of around $47 billion. Following the announcement, shares of BowX rose 2.5% in Friday premarket.

*****

> # 3. GameStop shares to open higher after soaring over 50%

> * GameStop shares jumped roughly 10% in Friday’s premarket, the morning after snapping a five-session losing streak and closing 52% higher. There was no apparent news Thursday. GameStop has been the most high-profile “meme stock,” popular among retail traders on Reddit and other social media platforms. The stock lost about a third of its value Wednesday after the video game retailer delivered disappointing fourth-quarter results, failed to give in-depth detail about its digital turnaround plans, and acknowledged it’s considering selling more stock.

*****

> # 4. Tesla ordered to have Elon Musk delete anti-union tweet

> * The National Labor Relations Board told Tesla to make Elon Musk delete a tweet that was seen as threatening to labor organizers within the company. The independent federal agency also ordered Tesla to reinstate a fired employee, Richard Ortiz, a union advocate. Tesla must also compensate Ortiz for loss of earnings, benefits and adverse tax consequences that resulted from his termination. The NLRB decision was largely in line with an administrative law judge’s ruling from 2019, which Tesla had appealed to the full board.

*****

> # 5. Suez Canal blockage delays estimated $400 million an hour in goods

> * The Ever Given, a stranded mega container ship in the Suez Canal, is holding up an estimated $400 million per hour in trade, based on the approximate value of goods that move through the key waterway every day. That’s according to shipping data and news company Lloyd’s List. Lloyd’s values the canal’s westbound traffic at roughly $5.1 billion a day, and eastbound traffic at around $4.5 billion a day. The Suez Canal, which separates Africa from Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world.

**AppSwarm to Launch Blockchain Research Lab in Tulsa and New York in Partnership with AI Venturetech**

Tulsa, OK, April 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via [NewMediaWire](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FlNZWsU9qWvg2QLFM-ah8WYICUBGJaiY7lBDg-80qu_O--uJPozpCh5rUy801n7cGNtmoiZ4XP8KAE7npQ37-YKrz8-teWdduqdZugatQ4U=) \-- AppSwarm, Corp. (OTC: [SWRM](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-lcjXYkUMvG7aXh5TEoFrvd5fQpkXvfw-9PqhEyQcVTJUeM4NxTCet1oS_nPMpS2DkkXAq2iPcBRFz5RznWJI8wOUToYMKSBLQZgD-UFob4alhaNtrqxIrMJGrE6HwDq)), a software development company and aggregator of mobile applications, announces plans to launch a blockchain research lab in Tulsa, OK and New York City to develop new applications utilizing different blockchain protocols.  


The Company announces plans to launch a Blockchain Research Lab and consulting firm in Tulsa, Oklahoma focused on the development and utilization of current blockchain protocols in partnership with AI Venturetech.

Blockchain is a decentralized transaction and data management technology. We will endeavor to partner with both commercial and academic partners to explore how this emerging industry can be deployed in real-world commercial applications.

Some areas of exploration will be in Decentralized finance (""DeFi""), non-fungible tokens (""NFT""), and smart contract development.

DeFi are financial services with no central authority. It involves taking traditional elements of the financial system and replacing the middleman with a smart contract, most commonly on the Ethereum blockchain.

NFT is a unit of data on a digital ledger called a blockchain, where each NFT can represent a unique digital item, and thus they are not interchangeable. NFTs can represent digital files such as art, audio, videos, items in video games, and other forms of creative work.

Research Lab in Tulsa

A coalition of Tulsa business, education, government, and philanthropists are working to foster a startup ecosystem in a city that’s better known for its aerospace and energy companies. Tulsa Remote provides workers a financial incentive and soft landing in a new city, as well as a thoughtful community-focused approach to attracting talented remote workers to Tulsa.

AppSwarm plans to work within Tulsa’s community to build on the foundation of the city’s current high-growth opportunities in technology and blockchain and attract top talent from around the country organically and through partnerships with local academic institutions.

The lab will embark on application research, seminars, blockchain workshops, and will utilize its video conferencing capabilities to bring together global minds and insights to Tulsa’s surging tech community.

New York Research Lab

The Company will also work in providing support to AI Venturetech for the launch of its blockchain research lab in the heart of New York City. The New York lab will work with local academic institutions and with commercial partners in both the financial and healthcare industries.

Thomas Bustamante, the Founder and CEO of AI Venturetech, Inc., commented, ""We are pleased to be working with AppSwarm in the development of blockchain research labs in both New York, and especially Tulsa, which is one of the fastest-growing technology hubs in the Midwest. We feel real-world applications of blockchain could harness the growth potential of what the Internet was in the mid-1990s, and we want to establish our labs now to take advantage of this rapid change.""

The Company will offer blockchain consulting advisory services to companies looking to integrate blockchain technology. These consulting services, along with low overhead costs to maintain the lab could quickly provide a profitable operation if executed properly.

554,"Question about my portfolio, diversity, any changes needed?","Hey there dividend gang, hope you are all well. I am currently 17 and investing and have all my money in tech, (AAPL,TSLA,ZM,AMD,AMZN,NVDA,FB,TSM,MSFT,GOOGL). I was thinking of adding some etfs (with dividends). I am aware this question gets asked a lot also, so I'm asking more of specific advice. Should I be diversifying into something like VT or SCHD? If so how much of my port? Again my goals are for this to be in the DRIP system, I just want something away from tech to add too and I want a rough estimate of how much of my port that should be, how many etfs I should have etc. Thank you all!",2021-04-14 21:15:01
555,"Diversification, Questions about ETFs: STOCKS (VTI/IVOG/VONG)","Hey there dividend gang, hope you guys are doing well. I wasn't sure which subreddit to put this in, but I decided since you guys were so informational/helpful last time I posted in here, I could ask here. So recently I have been talking to a friend and was told I needed to allocate some money into ETFs for my port which is made of  (AAPL, TSLA, ZM, AMD, AMZN, NVDA, FB, TSM, MSFT, GOOGL). 

&#x200B;

So I came in here and asked, you guys said to diversify it with an ETF, such as VTI or SCHD. So this is where I went to talk to a financial advisor to ask, and he gave me a couple of options. He said to invest in VTI, VONG, IVOG. (and a global fund). I really came here to ask, do I need these three? It seems to me like VONG has 50% of their holding in companies I already own stock in my port. VTI is for sure a buy for me. IVOG seems to have diversity but I am not sure about this one. 

  
I was just wondering (you guys know more)(and I'm new to ETF Diversification), for easy diversification, is VTI/IVOG/VONG good? Or is there a better option. My goal is to have growth but have a solid base of ETFs to add to. And also, is there a specific allocation you would do to each of the ETFs, and how much % of the ETFs of your port would they hold?

&#x200B;

(also they all pay dividends)

Thank you guys so much for helping it really means a lot.",2021-04-21 22:10:56
556,Zoom still a good investment?,"I contributed to the Zoom invested community with the video below and will be making an updated video on Zoom soon. If you're an investor in ZM would love to hear your opinion on the future potential or lack there of so I can add all opinions to new video...

557,My $ZM DD was on point and you can still profit from it!,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwvu0d/zoom_puts_are_free_money_dd_inside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

In this call that I made back on January 17th, 2021, I offered a play that would have profited you over 50% value in the course of 4 months. 

My call was “buy Zoom (ZM) shares in anticipatory run of earnings, sell afterwards, then buy puts with the profit.” Had you followed this play 1:1, here would have been the results:

Buy shares on January 19th for roughly $390. Sell on March 2nd for $439. This is a 12% increase in under 2 months. 

Then, you would have bought $ZM puts. $220p August 20th 2021 and $160p January 21st, 2022.

At the time of posting, $ZM is at roughly $330, or about 75% of the value it was back when I suggested you buy the puts. Both of these puts are DEEP otm, but as the pandemic begins to wane in the USA, the largest market for $ZM, and has doctors, medical practitioners, and therapists begin using HIPAA Conforming Telehealth tools, I see ZM finally resting at around $120-150 by the end of January 2022. 

Keep in mind, this prediction of ZM’s stock value is still 2-3x the price it was back in January 2020, pre (worldwide) pandemic. This takes into account the fact that ZM has now become the near universal video chatting tool and will be used in years to come, while not being the absolute monster of a stock it is now.

Thoughts?

Oh, also shoutout to the guy who told me that I’d be ruining my own life if I took up my own play :)

Note: It’s come to my attention that Zoom is now HIPAA compliant. At the time of my original post, it was NOT. I was not aware of this new information.

My guidance is still largely the same. I have connections in the psychology/therapy field and I know that 95% of therapists are using “Theranest” instead of Zoom and many doctors adopted other platforms prior to Zoom becoming HIPAA compliant, and I expect little turnover.",2021-04-28 18:50:28

563,"is ZM gonna collapse further, now that the stay-at-home period is coming to an end?","ZM started at around $100 pre covid.

Went as high as $588, and now sits around $300. I think it will eventually fall back below $150.

What does the company have to prop up these prices?

People are going back to the office soon, and I'm guessing only a fraction of those people will continue to use Zoom. 

Some people might be overestimating how much of the work force will be permanently working from home. Companies are probably not going to suddenly give up their real estate.

Zoom's 2020 growth can't be extrapolated into future years.

Zoom isn't the only video conferencing player out there, so what's so special about it? People were using Cisco and Google Meet or Hangouts before this.

&#x200B;

Motley fools tried to pump ZM on March 16 as it was falling, when it was at $350, and since then it has fallen 23% to $270 the last few days.

Why are you going long, or shorting ZM ?",2021-05-15 04:09:03

565,"Cleanest Options Flow from Last Week - Setups going into Next Week - QQQ, CRWD, ARKK, PAGS, ZM, ABNB","I built a bot a couple of weeks ago  that looks at the live options flow all day and finds heavy repeated  flow where a lot of money is being spent. This type of flow can predict  future price activity especially if the contracts are out of the money.  Based on this principle, here are some great plays with cleanest options  flow from this week.

All of these are potential plays that I'll be playing in the next few weeks. Hope folks will find these beneficial both for day trading and swing trading. 

Let's start with **$ZM.**  There were a bunch of puts bought towards 330 and a put bought above  ask for 250 all expiring in the next few months.  There was some  interesting call flow towards 400 but very little.  Play here is 330  puts for July/August.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oqr1ef67gk271.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5c2b9719dd8c25d4be1ed3bd134a29a3945fca23

**$PAGS** this was my favorite flow that we caught last week. There were tons of 50 calls and a lot of money was being spent on them.  The stock has already gone from 45 to 49 based on the flow we caught. But there seems to be more upside.  Plays is 52.5 September Calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1v2c34w9gk271.png?width=2542&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=98e29212058fb461178a66a44922e8ba97665914

**$ABNB** another excellent setup here. There are a few puts here but quite a lot of calls towards 140-150. Clean flow!  The play here is 140-150 calls for August/September.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iraf5tlagk271.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d697cf62b601a6a91711df5105ad37e87fd11b22

**$CRWD** I believe we have earnings here this week. Risk setup but there's abundant flow towards 230-235 calls.  Play here is to just follow smart money. June 235 calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4c1dg24bgk271.png?width=2544&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=239e192870fd32ee3ed32ec06a5361e4ca5d5872

**$ARKK** some heavy puts here + reveral after touching the 50 moving average. We are still in a downtrend so this can also be an excellent hedge play if you are into growth stocks.  Play here is 90-100 puts 2 months out.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zc5zxpbgk271.png?width=2242&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=441c930a4162f5397ea3b6f77abbb2744a71bd3f

**$QQQ** this is a lotto play but there are tons of heavy puts on QQQ last week. I'd buy a few puts far out of the money both as a hedge and as a lotto.  Play here 315 puts for July 16.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0oyohc7cgk271.png?width=2242&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70120d7f2682d4af525475026c923ad460438720

**$UBER** final one here. Heavy calls towards 55 strike + clean flow.   Play here is 55 strikes for August 20. Follow the expiration here! Don't go short term.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p0ozdducgk271.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1c05d527ee8dfef8ea190c53057c357b525994f

That's it. Please always do your own DD along with these plays for the best results. Options flow should always be coupled with price action analysis to find the best plays. Also, let me know if this is something the community likes. I can post these every week.

Cheers! Good luck with your trading this week.",2021-05-31 22:36:46

567,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 2, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 2, 2021**

The three major indexes traded roughly flat in an otherwise action-packed day. The rally in the movie-theater company AMC went to another level, with the company gapping up more than 100% today (up roughly 255% in the week, 570% for the month). AMC now has a larger market cap (roughly $30 billion) than Gamestop (GME) ever did at the height of its rally. In other news, market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports. 

The month-long battle between short-sellers and retail investors took another drastic turn, with AMC rocketing up, reaching as high as $72.62 and overtaking Gamestop (GME) in terms of market cap. This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining. Shares of other so-called “meme stocks” that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) gained more than 60% while Naked Brand Group (NAKD) and BlackBerry (BB) were up 28% and 30%, respectively. Shares of Gamestop (GME) were up roughly 13%.

New economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain. The Institute of Supply Management’s headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages. The report found that companies and their suppliers “continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand”, noting that “record lead times, wide scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments.” As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. The ISM's headline index registered a reading of 61.2 in May, an increase from April's reading of 60.7 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector. Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster; readings below indicating contraction. 

However, it’s important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves, material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved. And as supply starts to meet demand, the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down.  In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the near-term. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. 

**Highlights**

* The U.S. said Wednesday it will impose tariffs on the U.K. and five other countries in response to their taxes on U.S. technology companies, but will suspend the levies for six months as it seeks to negotiate an international resolution.
* Tesla Inc is recalling nearly 6,000 U.S. vehicles because brake caliper bolts could be loose, with the potential to cause a loss of tire pressure, documents made public on Wednesday show.
* Twitter Inc said Tuesday it will begin testing ads on its disappearing posts feature called Fleets, as it works to offer more options for advertisers. The company previously said it set a goal of doubling its annual revenue by 2023 from last year's levels, which it plans to achieve in part by selling ads on more parts of its site and mobile app.
* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. 
* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.
* **\*\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\*\***
* Broadcom (AVGO) target raised by Piper Sandler from $500 to $525 at Overweight. Stock currently around $474
* Costco (COST) with two price target raises. Stock currently around $381
   * Citigroup from $380 to $400 at Neutral 
   * Wells Fargo from $400 to $415 at Overweight
* Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) target raised by Raymond James from $300 to $305 at Strong-Buy. Stock currently around $208
* Charles Schwab (SCHW) target raised by Wells Fargo from $76 to $88 at Overweight. Stock currently around $75
* Xpeng (XPEV) target raised by Citigroup from $50 to $51 at Buy. Stock currently around $35.
* Zoom (ZM) with a host of price target raises after reports a positive earnings surprise. Average price target $387.2. Stock currently around $327

They were at around 400 and dropped to 280, then back to 340 then down to 310. Why is it that on large NASDAQ green days this doesn't move, but on red days this goes down huge? Stock should have been at 360 this week imo. I'd be more bearish on products like ZM which may be profitable, but no forward guidance of what their business model is trying to achieve.

570,"Cleanest + Repeated Options Flow Plays Series # 3 - AMC, CLNE, FUBO, ARKK. FB, FUTU, JMIA","Back with some great plays for everyone. Started [this series about 2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/npjj9c/cleanest_options_flow_from_last_week_great_setups/) in another subreddit and many of the plays have been working extremely well e.g $ZM puts, $ARKK puts, $PAGS calls, $ABNB calls, and a lot more. You can check the previous plays by going to my profile.

Many of these plays are quite short term which is why I'm posting this in this subreddit.

# What is ""Clean + Repeated Flow""?

Any stock where the options flow has a single out of the money contract that dominates the overall flow has what I call ""clean + repeated"" options flow. The flow has to be all ""buys"" with large amounts of premiums being spent on it.

The reason for having this criteria is to find plays where other smart people are expecting the price to increase or decrease significantly, hence the OTM plays only.

Let's go.

# AMC

Let's start with the most famous stock last week with billions of dollars spent on it.  Although this is extremely high risk, there are tons of contracts towards 60-80 strikes for the next 1-2 weeks.  High risk but a lot of possible reward as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ur9lid7ngq371.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=490810004d413777041076a2f21b53a6bcb7dadd

# CLNE

Clean flow here, no puts at all on Friday. Expecting the price to increase by a few dollars by the next few weeks.  Play here is September 17, 13 strike calls.

https://preview.redd.it/te1ouznngq371.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=25e02fbdec04ca06fafed7c704aa6bec2ee67c65

# FUBO

Again, clean flow here towards 28 strike with one trade for the 40 strike.  I like the fact that the sold call was for 28 strike which means that might be the minimum we go next week.  **Play here are 40 calls for 11 November 2021.**

https://preview.redd.it/6hf1za6ogq371.png?width=2126&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95bd8c48f44e558e6049c9cbe6790f00f78bdced

# ARKK

Plenty of puts flow keeps on coming. Growth stocks are making good moves, so these might be hedged positions, but the flow remains bearish on ARKK. Not super high confidence, but it can act as a hedge if it doesn't work out. **Play here is 107 puts for July 16th.**

https://preview.redd.it/sxmofaoogq371.png?width=2127&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6495647e63f6b52e857b323c77576827e561a336

# FB

Heavy short term bullish flow here. I'd expect the price to keep increasing throughout the week.  **Play here is 345 calls for July 16th.**

https://preview.redd.it/zp78ts6pgq371.png?width=2117&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce0c481fa05269dbbbb21aac8c48e60a4b6fbc32

# FUTU

Lots of call buying going on here for the 155 strike. We caught this on Friday, and it has already panned out a bit, but there might still be money to be made here.  **Play  here would be 155 calls for July.**

https://preview.redd.it/iwdns6ppgq371.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bb9910e9e4376bad949c1ef7f40e948c0d61aea1

# JMIA

Someone was very confident in a price increase here. Plenty of orders filled above ask for the 33 strike here.  **Play here is 33 strike for July 16th or June 18th.**

https://preview.redd.it/zzc7cleqgq371.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=10fbe39972d1b17eecdbe53497a0a65ee6631bab

571,Don't Look Now But ZM About To Zoom.,"Positive divergence on the RSI. Basing below the $350 level which is the low after the huge gap up earnings blowout in September 2020. Revenue growth is still strong even after vaccines are rolled out. Although we're going back to the office, we're only going back a few days a week which means we all still need our Zoom subscriptions. Ain't nobody cancelling no Zoom. It's is a verb now...like Coke is for soft drinks, Uber for ride-hailing or Google for search. I am long ZM since $100 and although I sold 20% of my position between $550-585, I am holding the rest and it looks ready for a move higher.

Stay long and strong friends, and disregard the naysayers and value investors who never bought a stock with a PE above 20.

&#x200B;

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY and QQQ gapping up slightly pre market. Yesterday was a tough day and for the last few months Thursday's for the most part have sucked to trade. Healthcare was the leading sector and Solar was the leading industry. Biotech continues to move as we have also seen plenty of Biotech stocks making nice moves lately. We had a big push at the open and then a big fade off and semi recovery in the SPY. This creates an illusion of strength as the market in general was strong but individual stocks for the most part were getting sold off/chopping sideways in ranges. QQQ and SPY moved higher while IWM was selling off also created a less than ideal trading environment. AMZN is very heavily weighted and it was moving higher as well which was helping the main indices. Judging by yesterday's trading action and by the gappers I see pre market or the lack thereof, I will be cautious today. It's Friday and no one likes losing on Friday's including myself. If you do find yourself losing on a Friday, it is important not to take it to heart and to enjoy your weekend, we cannot make money every day but we can limit  our losses by setting a max loss. This max loss can be a set amount of losing trades or a set amount of money. Once your max loss is hit, just walk away. By limiting your losing days you will learn to except the losses and you won't destroy your account. Not many earnings being released, so we will have to focus on stocks with catalyst and trends/trending sectors. I'll be running a scan today at the open to find volume and movers. If things are looking similar to yesterday, I just won't trade. Have a good weekend. See you all Monday, good luck out there!

\**I do not add stocks under $5. If there is a stock that is under $5 here then it was above $5 when I added it. The reason being is that most penny stocks halt which is very risky and they are also highly manipulated*\*

Much better trading day then the pure torture of yesterday's low volume crawl that was like waiting at the DMV and never getting your number called.

I started out going long CNC at 73.35 at around 9:55am (I will put all times in EST, even though I am on the west coast) and quickly sold it ten minutes later for a $1 gain.  CNC breached an alert line I had set for it awhile back.

DDOG caught my eye around 10am with such a strong open and a great looking daily chart. DDOG is through all of its SMA's and breached horizontal resistance.  I went long at 99.23 at 10am.   I stayed with DDOG even as it fell to 96.29 because it remained above the 8EMA and all major technical support areas on the daily chart (this is why it is so important to take stocks that have good daily charts).  DDOG closed the day at 98.38, I am currently holding it down .91 cents a share and not at all concerned.  This trade will be fine.

I made my only mistake of the day going long ROKU at 345.06 at 10:18, it was through the SMA 50 and had Relative Strength. The mistake wasn't entering the trade, it was not exiting when it went below the SMA 50 and I didn't sell it.  I am holding ROKU right now at an average cost of 398.70.  Remarkably stupid decision on my part - not only did I not get out of the trade, but I also averaged down.

At 11:01am I went long ZI at 48.40 and sold it at 11:24am at 48.95 for a .55 gain.  ZI went through its SMA 100 with ease and even with SPY remaining stable it continued to move up showing Relative Strength to the market.

11:45am I went long ENPH at 152.15.  I saw that there was horizontal resistance on ENPH around 153.30, so I put in an offer right below that for 153.15.  SPY began dropping in anticipation of the FED, but ENPH consolidated, telling me to stay in the trade.  I liked the daily chart with the breakout to the upside of its' compression and was prepared to hold the stock overnight if needed.  Turned out I didn't need to as at 12:54pm it sold for a $1 gain. 

At 11:50am I shorted TTWO at 172.68 and bought it back at 2:10pm at 169.55 for a $3.13 gain.  TTWO has one of the uglier daily charts you will see, breaking out of consolidation to the downside and crashing right through its' SMA's as if they weren't there.  On the 5 minute chart, even as SPY was climbing in the morning, TTWO was continuing its' decline.  This trade was a no-brainer and worked out quite well.

At this point I started watching WISH as it kept banging up against VWAP.  On its fourth attempt I put in a buy order for 10.85 and moved on to the next trade.

At 12:31pm I shorted TAL at 24.60.  Remember when I said TTWO had an ugly daily chart? Well TAL's may just be worse.  Around 2 hours later I bought it back at 23.68 for a .92 gain.  TAL has been one of the weaker stocks this past week, and when combined with Relative Weakness, this was also an easy trade to take.  My mistake here was that I should have taken it sooner.  TAL was on my list for shorts and for some reason I did not check the chart until around 3 hours into trading.

At 1:17pm I went long ELAN at 36.15 as I liked the daily chart and the Relative Strength on the 5 minute basis. ELAN then proceed to do absolutely nothing for the next two hours and I scratched the trade for breakeven.

Three minutes later I went long ZM at 362.01, also liking the breakout to the upside on the compression for the daily chart which formed the beginnings of a bull flag, the next resistance point being over $20 away, and the breach of the horizontal resistance yesterday.  Then I watched as ZM dropped, and dropped, and dropped, all the way down to 355.41 (thanks Fed!).  I averaged down for the second time today, bringing my price to 359.40.  Why did I average down? Because my brain was set on ""idiot"" this morning.  Still holding ZM was the right play as no technical indicators were breached.  At 3:30pm, I sold ZM for 361.80, which was a 2.40 gain.  This turned into a nice trade for me even though I was a moron for averaging down.

Thanks to the FED announcement I took BK long at 51.30 and decided to hold it overnight.  There is a textbook bull flag on today's five minute chart, and the stock held all the gains from that parabolic move at 2pm.

Around 2:25 I added to VXX calls to hedge against the FED press conference.  I took the 6/25 30 strike calls for 2.70 each and the sold them 20 minutes later for 3.15, a gain of .45 per contract.

At this time I also watched my fellow traders go in on EYES and for some reason I did not.  Why? Because my brain was set to ""idiot"" remember?

3pm is when WISH order went through at 10.85.  This was purely a volume breakthrough of VWAP play.  WISH was dancing around VWAP for most of the day and I knew if it got enough volume behind it that the stock would go - which it did.  Literally just sold WISH right as I am writing this recap, in After Hours for 11.20, a 35 cent gain.  Resistance is at 11.35 and I will look tomorrow to see if it breaks through.

Throughout the day I scalped various stocks which are not worth mentioning here.  Overall an excellent day, I am holding a few stocks overnight (DDOG, BK, ROKU) and now I am making my watchlist for tomorrow.",2021-06-16 18:38:41
575,Day Trading Options,"I went back and forth on how to write a post on Day Trading Options.  One can get very granular on this topic but ultimately it seemed to me that what most people wanted was a general guide.

*It was pointed out to me that I spend way too much time replying to people who post disruptive/antagonistic comments.  I agree.  So moving forward I will be ignoring comments that are posted solely for the purpose of being argumentative.  If you question my qualifications or intentions, both of those have been addressed numerous times and you can check my profile.  I have been a Day Trader for five years, consistently profitable for the last three years, and I do this for a living.  I have nothing to sell, nor do I benefit from anything I recommend in terms of resources.*

*Comments that try to disparage Day Trading in general will also be ignored, as this is a Day Trading sub, if you don't think it is possible to be successful Day Trading than your only reason for being here is to antagonize people.*

*As always, I will engage in substantive disagreement or criticism, as those discussions are part of what make forums like this worthwhile.*

So....Options.  I am going to assume that people here have a general understanding of what Options are, including the Greeks (*if not than this post will be of limited use to you as you* ***should not*** *be trading options unless you understand them).*  Thus, if the extent of your understanding is, ""Use a Call when you think it is going up and a Put when you think it will go down..."" you should probably skip the rest of this and learn the mechanics of Option Trading first.

While Options have many purposes, the ***primary purpose of using Options to Day Trade is - leverage.***  Otherwise you would simply use the stock directly which is far easier, and tends not to be subject to issues in liquidity.

Given this, the closer to parity with the underlying that you get on option pricing, the better (if you are buying options rather than selling them) -  ideally a stock worth $120 would have $100 Calls worth $20.  But since you are paying for time and volatility as well (not going to get into *Rho* here), you are getting charged a premium.

Also, as a general rule, I do not hold Options over an earnings date.  Many people buy Calls or Puts on a stock right before earnings, and even when they get the move they were expecting their options did not increase in value - usually due to an **IV Crush**.  Option pricing is higher before earnings because there is more volatility around the predicted future range of pricing for that stock.  If you add the price of the ATM Calls + Puts together you will get a rough idea of the +/- expected $ move post-earnings.  The larger that move is in proportion to the stock price, the higher the volatility.  Once those earnings are released, that volatility deflates, taking down the Option premium with it.    Earnings and the stocks response to earnings is simply too unpredictable, and also well outside the purview of Day Trading (as these occur pre or post-market).

This is how I Day Trade Options, it isn't the only way, it may not even be the *best* way, but it has worked for me - as always you need to explore what works best for yourself:

**1) High Delta - 1-3 WTE :**  I have a decent account balance but not 5,000 shares of NVDA ""decent"" and certainly not 5,000 shares of AMZN level.  So it is on stocks like these (usually priced over $500) that I will use to Options to Day Trade.  However, my NVDA may be your AAPL - so essentially, I am using Options when I cannot afford to get enough shares of the stock to make the trade worth it.  The temptation here is to go for the cheaper options which are going to be OTM or ATM - but I recommend against this.  The underlying position has to make a larger move to get those options close enough to parity to start overcoming what you paid in premium.  In the end your Risk/Reward is much better on the ITM options.

*For example:  You want to go long AAPL using Options - You can either use the 2 weeks out options with a Delta of .8 or the ATM options that expire this week.*

***Choice 1 - On Monday 6/21 you buy 5 123 Strike Calls on AAPL that expire 7/09 for $8.15 each, costing you $4,075.  Assuming the stock is at $130.46, you are paying .69 cent extra (123+8.15= $131.15-$130.46 = .69) in premium ($345). The Delta is .8 and Gamma is .03.***

*Scenario A - The stock goes up $1.50 on Monday.  At the end of the day your option would now be worth (not using an Option Calculator so this is a rough estimate) - + $1.20 (Delta) + .015 (Gamma) - .01 (Theta) = $9.36 (roughly).  You made about $1.21 per contract, or roughly $605.*

*Scenario B - The stock stays the same - since the Theta on these options is only .06 you can hold them overnight with minimal loss ($30 total).*

*Scenario C - The stock declined $1.50 - as the stock declines you have room on the Delta to weather the decrease.  With the stock now at $128.96, your options would be worth roughly $6.85 (although a decline like this would most like increase volatility, further cushioning the drop) a loss of $1.30 per option, which is roughly $650 total.  However, you can still hold this option if you believe AAPL will recover enough in the next 2-3 weeks.*

***Choice 2 - On Monday 6/21 you buy ATM (130 strike) options on AAPL for $1.80.  Because they are cheaper, you get 23 of them for $4,140 (roughly the same cost as 5 options in Choice 1).  Assuming the stock is at $130.46 you are paying an extra $1.34 (130+1.80 = 131.80-130.46 = $1.34) in premium ($3,082).***

*Scenario A - The stock goes up $1.50 on Monday.  At the end of the day your option would now be worth (not using an Option Calculator so this is a rough estimate) - + .78 (Delta) + .04 (Gamma) - .09 (Theta) = $2.53 (roughly).  You made about $.73 per contract, or roughly $1,679.*

*Scenario B - The stock stays the same - since the Theta on these options is .15 it now cost you $330 (roughly) to hold these overnight in additional time decay.*

*Scenario C - The stock declined $1.50 - and you are now screwed.  Your options are worth about .75 cents each, you've lost roughly $2,415 on them, and if you hold them overnight they will continue to decline rapidly with time decay kicking in faster.*

Compare the Risk/Reward on both of these choices (*Choice 1 - $650/$605, Choice 2 - $2,415/1679)* \- and while these are rough guesses they aren't too far off from what would happen (a good Option Calculator can help here).

**Choice 1 is better.**

*Less contracts - Higher Delta - More Time to Expiration.*

*Naturally this applies to Puts as well.*

You are looking for the following attributes in the stock you are want to Day Trade with Options:

*Strong Intra-Day Chart -* Ideally you want a stock that is strong vs the market (SPY) or weak vs the market (SPY), depending on if you are doing calls or puts.  The stock should be through any significant support/resistance (e.g. you do not want to do calls on a stock that is at 119.75 if their SMA 100 on the daily chart is at 120, you need to see it go through that and hold, first).  Relative volume usually needs to be above 1.5, and you should using VWAP to guide you as well.

*Strong Daily Chart -* Obviously the Daily chart will be important in telling you where significant support/resistance lies, but you also want to see an overall strong directional trend (bullish or bearish depending on your desired position).  I like to see HA candles in a continuation (e.g. flat bottomed) at least two in a row, and orderly trends without parabolic moves.  If you choose the right options and the stock hasn't violated any major areas of S/R, you can hold them overnight.

Your exit should be similar to the exit you would have used if you were trading the stock - the same principles apply.

**2**\*\*\*)\*\*\* **Selling Premium -** This is rarely used a Day Trading method and for good reason, you are usually not going to get much bang for the margin you are spending if you only plan to flip them within the same day.  As a general rule I only sell Puts on a stock I wouldn't mind owning at that price.  If I get assigned, I am perfectly happy with it, and if I keep the credit, I am also happy with that.  Overall, I  would not recommend this strategy for Day Trading as you are removing the primary benefit of selling premium - *theta decay.*

**3) Debit Spreads -** Call Debit Spreads(CDS') are an acceptable and widely used method to Day Trade Options, particularly among those that are risk adverse.  Here are some simple rules to follow that will help increase your odds:

*A) Find stocks that are making significant moves on that day - note, I am not talking about low float cheap morning gappers - rather I am referring to stocks like ROKU, ZM, ABNB or stocks like SNAP or NIO (these stocks are examples as they are capable of making and sustaining big daily moves, but their are many like these).  Basically you want a stock that is up more than 3-5% and holding those gains after an hour into trading.  They should be strong against the market, meaning if the market (SPY) is going down, this stock is staying strong either still going up or compressing.  There is usually at least one stock a day that qualifies, sometimes two or three.  Volume will of course taper off, but you do want to see Relative Volume over 1.5.*

*B) You are looking for the ATM Options to do the CDS' and they expire* ***this*** *week - so on Friday a stock like ROKU would have been perfect.  Around 10:25 SPY started to drop and ROKU continued to build on already strong gains.  In this case you would want something like the 360/365 or 360/362.5 spread.  You* ***never*** *want to pay more than 50% of the distance between the strikes.  If you were doing the 360/365 Spread, you want to pay less than $2.50 for that spread - obviously, the lower the better.*

*C) The moment you put the spread in, you put in your order to receive your credit.  The day of the week matters here - On a Monday put in an order to get 10% profit, Tuesday would 15% profit, Wednesday - 20-25% profit, Thursday - 25%-40% profit, and Friday - 40% - 75% profit.  Rarely do I keep these until expiration unless the stock just blows through the strikes.  The reason the day matters is that these spreads only start to really move when you are close to expiration, it is difficult to get more than these percentages on those days.  If you took that ROKU spread on a Monday (360/365) and paid a $2.00 debit, you should look to get a $2.20 credit, but on Friday (since it is expiring that day) you could have gotten at least a $3.00 credit.*

I see traders that do this type of spread as their primary trade type, and by the end of the week they would have executed roughly 20-25 of them, with over a 95% win rate.  These are usually very safe spreads, but of course with low risk also comes low returns; however, they are consistent.  The stock doesn't have to make much more of an upward move to hit your target, and considering how strong they were to begin with it is very rare to miss with these.  Obviously there is always a stock like NVDA which on Friday if you did a 765/770 spread in the morning, it would have made perfect sense, but quickly reversed.  In those cases you should recognize the reversal and take the loss (e.g. if you paid $2.00 for NVDA, you should accept a $1.50 credit,  do not let the stock drop to where the credit is lower than that, just take the  loss).

**4) Lotto Trades**  \- These are the most fun, and are specific to Friday.  What you are looking for are stocks that have options expiring that day.  In the final hour of trading, the ATM options are going to be very close to parity.  So a stock that is $119.80 cents, will have $120 call options worth roughly .05-.10 cents with an hour left.  What you are looking for are stocks that are either relatively strong (or weak if you are doing this with Puts) to the market and a market tailwind (in the direction of your options).  You are looking for these options to get into the money, but even if they don't you can still do quite well with them.  On Friday for example, back to NVDA, it began dropping and the 750 Puts were worth roughly .20 cents with 25 minutes remaining and NVDA at around 755.  The stock was weak compared to the market (on the 5 minute chart when SPY went up, NVDA went down), and SPY began to drop with volume (tailwind).  If you bought 25 of those Puts ($500), within 10 minutes they would have been worth $3.60 an 1,800% increase.  Your $500 would now be worth $9000.    You won't find a better Risk/Reward play than lotto options.  However, note, you shouldn't be making large financial plays here as a many of these won't work, but the ones that do more than pay for the ones that did not.  Many times I take max loss on these; however, since these can turn very quickly, I have also taken that smaller loss only to see the stock soar or plummet in those final ten minutes.  Either way, these are really fun (I have a more detailed post on this).

So there you have it, like I said, there are many other ways to Day Trade Options (would like to hear them), but this is how I like to do it and it has worked well for me over the years.",2021-06-20 17:16:12

JPM is looking for a long bullish mode, the FED is going to raise interest rate sooner than 2023 predicted because fear of inflation. also it hit $148 3 moths resistance point.

PLTR is losing it's gains for the last 2 weeks after may 13th Long bull run. PLTR is nothing but a high customer Saas company which companies include only high profile government and government agencies. Because of their very narrow targeted audience and client base there is very little room to grow.

JMIA: I would look into JMIA into great interest. This is one of the top ecommerce site in Africa region, Many big companies are investing heavily in africa. I have a prediction amazon will also try to take over the Africa market, and soon JMIA will get an offer to for getting bought either by amazon or Alibaba for africa market dominance.

RIDE:

If u wanna short any company ride will be your #1. The CEO said fake numbers, new CEO also saying fake numbers. Doesn't have a product ready. They only formed a company only to lure investors and milking them. Lawsuits are piling.

&#x200B;

AMC: Amc might get boost until it hits $100 but will fall off rapidly. AMC is not like GME where there is good business. HULU, NETFLIX are making AMC business nonexistent. I would be very caution as a long term investor.

ZM: Zoom might be a winner in the pandemic but it will be fruitful for longterm short players. With Google meet's free software and people are coming back to the office, ZM's over value position will trubmle.  Their growth is already falling down

578,CLOV detailed DD,"Hi everybody, I've decided to finally try and write up a more in depth DD for CLOV because I think a lot of people have a tough time understanding their business model, and understanding why they have a legitimate shot at helping to fix one of the biggest issues with healthcare in America. For some background, I'm an MD who did my undergraduate degree focused on healthcare systems and economics-essentially many of the same courses someone pursuing an MPH would take (I actually did about 2/3rds of the courses required for an MPH at my alma mater). So in addition to being a WSB degen I understand what Clover Health is trying to accomplish, and I'm going to try and explain it because I think unlike a video game retailer or a movie theater most people have no idea wtf CLOV does.

# What is Medicare Advantage and why was it created?

To understand Clover's business model we first need to understand what ***Medicare Advantage*** is, because that's Clover's primary business model (though they also have expanded into Direct Contracting Medicare which is somewhat similar). Medicare Advantage was created by the government to try and fix a lot of the broken incentives in our healthcare system that have lead to rampant inflation in the cost of healthcare in the US.

Have you ever wondered why healthcare costs per person [**have more than doubled in the last decade?**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HLTHSCPCHCSA)  Healthcare costs have been growing for a long time and [have worsened wealth inequality](https://www.ft.com/content/0d7ea0c1-f0b8-4c8a-a532-f18f147079bc) due to growing 5X since 1980, but this inflation has accelerated the last decade so we're going to focus on the primary cause of this for simplicity.

Right now, literally everyone in the existing healthcare system has had financial incentives to continue driving up costs, from consumers to hospitals to physicians to drug companies to insurance companies. Focusing on insurance though, the crazy thing is that **insurance companies only make more money if healthcare costs more money.**

Wait a minute you say, ""That makes no sense! Why would insurance companies make more money if they're paying out more money?"" That might have been the case in the past but over most of the last decade insurance companies have been restricted by the [80/20 rule](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/rate-review/), a frankly economically stupid regulation that was ironically pitched as a way to bring costs down in health insurance. You'll often see this referred to as a ""Medical Loss Ratio"" especially when talking about earnings for insurance companies. But basically the law was changed so that insurance companies could only keep 20% of whatever money they charged for an insurance policy and had to pay out at least 80%.

So what did health insurance companies do? With this new law it meant that every insurance company was **now aligned with** ***higher*** **payouts to hospitals, physicians and pharmacies** and [stopped trying all that hard lower healthcare costs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145008/) because the higher their payouts were the more money they could charge on their insurance policies the next year. That's become the primary way for health insurers to grow their profits and revenues. Letting healthcare costs grow out of control is a big part of why [United Healthcare stock has rocketed up in a straight line up for the last decade-up more than 1300% since Obamacare passed in 2010.](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/UNH#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-)

Now, most people in the United States may have private healthcare through their work. But a very large chunk of healthcare costs are paid out by the government through Medicare because the oldest and sickest patients that use the most healthcare dollars are people over 65. The most expensive healthcare in America is the catastrophic kind-where patients have a stroke, have a heart attack, get cancer, and then they require repeated hospitalizations and extremely expensive treatments that run well into the six and seven figures. As healthcare costs have gone completely insane the amount of money the government has had to spend on Medicare has gone crazy as well. Medicare Advantage is their attempt at trying to align better healthcare that costs less with higher profits for insurance companies. Instead of hospitals and doctors billing the government directly for care provided to Medicare patients, the government just hands over a set amount of money for each patient that an insurer covers. So the more patients a health insurance companies has, the more money they get from the government for taking care of those patients. This basically brings back into the system the old incentive where spending less money on healthcare leads to better profits. Now you're going to think, doesn't that just mean they'll just deny paying for everything and make bank? No, because combined with this the government also looks at the quality of the outcomes and care that patients get, and the better the patients do the higher the pay you get per patient. This is the government's attempt to fix the completely broken incentives in the healthcare system.

# Why Clover Health?

So now you have some idea of what Medicare Advantage is. Why should you invest in Clover and not just buy shares of United Healthcare and Anthem since they've been printing money since before JPow bolted the turbo to the money printer? What it comes down to are two things.

**1)** **Clover Health is a ""pure"" play where focusing on improving healthcare by preventing health problems before they become catastrophic will always improve Clover's profitability.** Clover only covers patients with either Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Direct Contracting (to avoid this being 80 pages long, this is a type of  hybrid of traditional Medicare with incentives for quality and cost reduction). This means that they can aggressively focus on improving healthcare quality, preventing patients from needing to be hospitalized, preventing patients from having those heart attacks, strokes, cancer. If other insurance companies aggressively improved the health of their patients they would actually make less money over time because the majority of their profits come from patients on plans where they only make more money if you're less healthy and requiring more and more expensive healthcare. If United Healthcare or Anthem successfully got their patients to be healthier they'd actually make less and less money due to the 80/20 rule! So they literally cannot be aggressive in pursuing a focus on preventing those terrible healthcare problems because they'll actually annihilate their own profits if they succeed. Any company that's attempting to do both traditional health insurance and also Medicare Advantage will be fighting with itself, either they do really well with Medicare Advantage or they do really well with their traditional insurance business. They can't actually succeed in both because the path to profitability for each are completely different. With Clover, if they succeed it's literally a win for everyone. It's a win for shareholders with larger profits, it's a win for patients because they have better health, it's a win for physicians because their patients are healthier which actually means less of a workload and physicians actually getting paid to keep people healthy, it's a win for the entire United States because we can maybe stop setting all our money on fire and maybe do something other than spend a quarter of a our salaries on healthcare while having our healthcare system [ranked last place against similar nations](https://www.citizen.org/article/dead-last-u-s-health-care-system-continues-to-rank-behind-other-industrialized-countries/).

**2) Clover Assistant**. This is the killer app that Clover has been working on, it's their electronic health records system that attempts to keep track of all the moving pieces in healthcare to help physicians help their patients in a timely manner. For example, a lot of the time a patient gets hospitalized and they get well enough to go home, but they're supposed to follow up with their physician to make sure that they're continuing to improve, that they're not getting worse again. In traditional healthcare what happens is that the hospital physician sends the patient home and gives them a pile of papers and written somewhere in there is that they should go see their doctor within a week. The patient may or may not read this, and even if they do they'll call their doctor and the phone number will be busy and since they're not feeling well to begin with the patient gives up. 2 weeks later, the patient is feeling sicker than ever and ends up calling 911, ends up back in the emergency room, back in the hospital. [Medicare has attempted to punish this type of thing by financially penalizing hospitals for this type of situation known as a bounceback](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program) but it's still a rampant problem. With Clover Assistant however, the software is constantly looking at every patient's record and if it sees that a patient was hospitalized and discharged it proactively notifies their primary care physician that hey, you need to see and follow up with this patient to make sure they're continuing to get better. Then their physician might intervene with something like a $20 prescription for new antibiotics to help the patient continue to improve, instead of yet another $20,000 hospitalization. That's just one example of what it can already do today, but the Clover Assistant will eventually be able to use a large dataset of health records with AI to discover new ways to improve healthcare.

# Addressing short seller critiques

To be frank, the report from Hindenburg sounds like it was written by someone with absolutely no real knowledge of healthcare or the healthcare business. But since this report is what so many people like to harp on when trashing Clover Health as some sort of scam I'm going to address the points they bring up.

**#1 Claim: Clover is being investigated by the Department of Justice.**

Clover received what is known as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice, which is a request for more information from Clover to make sure that there is no Medicare fraud occuring. This doesn't mean that there's any actual fraud, but it's standard when the government is your primary payer that you get hit with these CIDs to make sure that everything is on the up and up. There's no credible evidence that this has any actual material impact on Clover Health's performance. As an example, where was Hindenburg's short report when [Anthem dealt with a DOJ CID in 2018?](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/anthem-doj-medicare-advantage-risk-adjustment-chart-review-civil-investigative-demand) If we [take a look at Anthem's stock during this same time period](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/ANTM#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--) we can see that there was literally no impact from this on their share price, and since 2018 their stock has grown over 70%! It's absurd to believe that this has any material impact even if you do somehow believe that Clover broke the law in pursuing their vision. They pitch it as an ""existential risk"", essentially insinuating that the government would stop working with Clover even though this is clearly not true as CMS has continued to approve Clover for new programs and frankly this has never happened to any legitimate health insurer. [Clover also recently added this heavy hitter to their board](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/health_care/clover-health-taps-former-cms-official-for-board/article_51803ebc-e162-596b-a372-d7907d6abe7a.html) which will help them navigate the complex regulations around Medicare.

**#2 Claim: Clover had tons of patients inappropriately funneled to them through Seek Healthcare**, a Medicare plan comparison portal owned by Clover's head of sales.

This claim just has no factual basis, the vast majority of plans recommended by Seek were for non-Clover plans so all the evidence out there points to them having been neutral in matching patients to a plan that would benefit them.  Regardless, Clover has made it clear on Seek's website that Seek is an affiliate of theirs.

**#3 Claim: Clover's software tries to ""upcode""**

If you're not familiar with healthcare this will sound negative, but what Clover's software is doing is literally what every piece of healthcare software does. Medicare billing codes can be coded higher (meaning that your care and work is seen as more valuable to Medicare) based on how much data you've included about a patient in your documentation. Traditionally on a paper chart a doctor would have needed to write down the x-rays, labwork, etc. to bill the higher codes but with electronic health records systems you can code at a higher level without extreme effort because all the data is right there. That's a large part of their business plan, because they can show that yes we have the data and our physicians are able to review this to provide better and more detailed care. Hindenburg makes it sound like they're doing something nefarious when in fact, reviewing and providing this extra data is exactly what will provide better care. Complete absurd negative spin from Hindenburg on this claim and I frankly don't know of any healthcare record software that would purposely not include healthcare data so that physicians would only be able to have rudimentary data-free documentation. That'd be beyond moronic.

**#4 Claim: Doctor's whine about Clover's software.**

So coincidentally in a past life I actually worked to train physicians to use electronic health record systems. I'm sure that Hindenburg was able to interview several physicians who would have complained about Clover Assistant, but the part they're not telling you is that a [third of physicians are over the age of 60.](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/physician-retirement-why-its-hard-doctors-retire) There is no software in existence that isn't going to be whined about by physicians, it doesn't matter if it's Allscripts, Epic, whatever, the reality is that the older physicians will struggle to learn any new software they have to deal with. If you've ever tried to help your grandma learn how to use a computer you probably have a good idea of what I'm talking about so to use this as a critique is yet again incredibly stupid.

**#5 Claim: Clover health pays doctors money to use Clover Assistant and they pay primary care physicians good money.**

Hindenburg tries to spin this as a negative, that doctors are getting paid $200 per patient visit to have them adopt Clover Assistant. Well, in order to improve patient outcomes and thus eventually make more money by having healthier patients the entire business model revolves around having physicians adopt Clover Assistant. Clover also pays primary care physicians more money because investing more money into primary care to prevent health issues down the line is their business model. **Studies show that** [**every $1 extra spent on primary care is going to save $12 down the line**](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/delivering-value-healthcare-starts-increased-primary-care-investment). This is actually what sets Clover apart from the other health insurance companies, they're going out of their way to pay primary care physicians more, so they can spend more time with each patient, **so they can use the Clover assistant to deliver higher quality care that'll prevent more health problems down the line**. Hindenburg doesn't actually seem to be able to at all understand Clover's Medicare Advantage business model here, which makes me seriously question how they felt they were qualified to analyze Clover at all.

**#6 Claim: Clover's CEO made his previous hospitals a ton of money charging a lot of money.**

I could go into the nuances of how the CEO justified this type of billing as a negotiation tactic with existing insurance companies that had bullied these hospitals into bankruptcy in order to save hospitals that were going to be shut down. But forget that and realize what you have here is a short seller ***spinning the CEO of a healthcare company being incredibly good at making money in healthcare as a negative***. I honestly can't think of a stupider fucking thing for a short seller to say.  Garipalli knows and understands the business of healthcare better than anyone else, and now with Clover he's going to fix how fucked up it is while Clover makes bank.

# Short term price catalysts/Short Squeeze prospects

This is probably the part that most of you degenerates care about so we probably should go over it. I think Clover health is going to be an incredible long term hold. Chamath thinks it's one of the most obvious 10-baggers he's ever seen and frankly I agree, but let's break down the short term.

Short Interest: Over the last few weeks SI has been 40-50% of the float. I know some people have talked about some institutional shares being misclassified, and the SI being even higher but it's not clear to me that this is the case. Nonetheless, [Ortex is looking into this](https://twitter.com/trades_dutch/status/1406999851313807362) so we'll know for sure what the correct numbers are soon enough. It really doesn't matter that much though, this is extremely highly shorted. When VW underwent their infinity squeeze **the SI was only 12%**, what actually made it squeeze was that all of a sudden the short sellers couldn't cover their position-that matters much more than the exact number the SI% is. 40-50% is honestly a massive number that's more than enough for a huge short squeeze to occur.

**Why did the price just jump?**

Now here's the big thing that makes me think that CLOV is a prime short squeeze target right now. If you read BS financial blog posts a lot of people claim that it's because of WSB reading the SEC filings where the short squeeze is mentioned as a risk, but that's not the reason. Obviously WSB has obviously thought it's a possible squeeze target for a long time so to believe that an SEC filing triggered the price runup is stupid.

The reason is simply that 6/22 is the day that a ton of shares became unavailable for short sellers to borrow. A ton of call options for CLOV expired ITM on 6/18. How these work is that they get executed after market hours finish and then the people who sold the calls have to settle them in 2 business days. That's known as T+2 settlement, which is the settlement time for options contracts in the US. So any hedge fund that sold naked calls had another 2 business days to provide the shares. Purchases can be done through prime brokerages with T+1 settlement, meaning that the last day a hedge fund or market maker could have scrambled for shares to hand out on 6/22 was Monday 6/21. So they had a lot of incentive to drive the price down and force some liquidity on Monday, which is pretty much what you saw happen. But Tuesday all those shares went to people who executed their ITM call options.

Now if you think about it, why would someone execute an ITM call option instead of just selling it off? It's because those entities want to hold those shares for a longer time frame. So as these shares got assigned off to folks who wanted to just hold these shares with their diamond hands you saw that share borrow availability tank. By 4PM on 6/22 there were ZERO shares available to borrow at IBKR and the borrow fee had jumped to almost 9%.

Regardless, that major change of hands in shares has likely made this one of the weeks where it's going to be harder than every before for short sellers to be able to obtain shares to close out their short position. Even though CLOV has had a very high short squeeze score for a while now [(100/100 at S3)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404880301428547585?s=19). I think the folks holding shares this week may be more likely than ever before to be the type that refuse to sell to the shorts cheaply.

# Long term value

This is admittedly hard to pin down because while CLOV doesn't currently generate profits they're an incredibly fast growing company. If they manage to achieve what they're trying to achieve the sky is going to be the limit, because we're talking about profit margins that would put every other insurer to shame while continuing to grow at double digit percentages per year. Plus while their current core business is Medicare Advantage and Medicare they also have an entire other business in the possibility of licensing out Clover Assistant. The EHR business could become another multi-billion dollar business alone. Allscripts is worth $2.5 billion and Epic is worth more but it's privately held. It's going to be years of work before Clover grows to a massive size and scale but I think if it does happen then Chamath's 10-bagger estimate is going to look conservative.

The compounding feature is used to achieve **up to 480% APY**, providing investors ample compensation for market volatility while generating substantial yields.

**QUAI’s Road Map**

So let's take a look at the roadmap and what is coming up on the calendar for QUAI. QUAI Invest (auto compounding farms, automated allocation & withdrawl for selected liquidity pools with automated yield optimization) + QUAI Interchange (DeFi on-ramp to Ethereum Mainnet and Binance Smart Chain money markets) and MeDIA eYe NFT Creator Portal (a unique solution for the NFT creator market and digital content marketing), which are all scheduled to launch in Q3 2021.

QUAI developers are working around the clock to ensure every milestone is reached within the Q3 launch plans, which will bring further value and utility to the QUAI ecosystem.

**QUAI Invest - QUAI Interchange + QUAI Farms**

Many Bitcoin users are long in BTC but currently don't have access to a frictionless platform allowing them to easily enter the DeFi markets on leading blockchains. QUAI Interchange which is a DeFi on-ramp that provides the opportunity for BTC holders to earn additional yield on their BTC and altcoin assets in an intuitive and gas-optimized way. QUAI Invest offers compounding farms and automated liquidity allocation with a yield optimization function, allowing Investors to access a variety of choices for capital allocation through the QUAI Invest platform .

**QUAI’s Investment in - MeDIA eYe NFT Creator Portal**

QUAI is planning to complete the development of MeDIA eYe NFT Creator Portal, retaining our first-mover advantage. The NFT Creator Portal allows anyone to easily create and launch NFT-media campaigns on multiple blockchains. The MeDIA eYe platform provides an intuitive and frictionless experience, regardless of pre-existing knowledge of distributed ledger technology. It also introduces novel digital engagement models, including the first-ever NFT-Subscription Service. Individuals or businesses can create custom NFTs for varied uses. For instance, the MeDIA eYe platform’s marketplace uses a variety of novel token-economic models for enhanced earnings and rewards. This creates attractive incentives for NFT artists and media creators to launch NFTs on the MeDIA eYe platform as well as to sell these NFTs on the marketplace.

Based on the current analysis we estimate in the next 12 months that MeDIA eYe can be valued at or above a 30-40 million dollar market cap. This estimation is based on the current growth of the NFT market along with having the first mover advantage as an NFT Creator Portal that will allow anyone from corporations to artists to effortlessly create NFT campaigns regardless of their crypto experience.

**QUAI’s Partner Projects Development - QUAI is working with ASKO DAO + rASKO Money Markets.**

AskoLend is a decentralized money market protocol, a fork of Compound Finance. The compound is decentralized, over collateralized loans protocol built on Ethereum. AskoLend differs from Compound in that: it will be launched on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It’s a multichain lending platform that will list mid-tier, upper mid-tier, and blue-chip market cap crypto assets. Lenders can select between high and low-risk lending pools. These differences lead to some benefits of AskoLend over Compound. With AskoLend’s utilization of BSC, the cost per transaction is significantly lower compared to Compound on Ethereum. AskoLend’s accessibility to lenders and borrowers, for a diverse range of crypto assets, increasing potential volumes of AskoLend’s lending and borrowing markets.

AskoLend can list up to 70 + crypto assets, compared to the 9 assets currently listed on Compound. Lastly, with AskoLend, lenders can pick their allocation between high-risk and low-risk lending tiers for over collateralized lending, allowing lenders an element of customization in their investment that isn’t available with Compound. QUAI intends to offer QUAI assets to borrow/lend on ASKOLend on BSC. We estimate that in the next 6-12 months that Asko will be valued well above the 30 million market cap. This is based on the current market caps of existing borrow and lend platforms, volume, and market penetration.

**QUAI’s Cross-Chain Development for Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum**

A substantial portion of QUAI tokens is allocated for investments, development, mergers, acquisitions, and expansion to other blockchains. QUAI is a cross-chain protocol. They employ over 40 employees working full-time on QUAI platforms development and partner projects.

Currently, QUAI trades on Uniswap V2, JulSwap, Dex-Trade along with PancakeSwap V1 and V2. QUAI is in ongoing negotiations with several CEX's for a listing and is deeply focused on growing the business and project so that future listings are made possible on Tier 1 exchanges.

QUAI’s partnership with Sports D³

580,What are your picks for the next group of stocks to be added to the S&P500 index?,"I have two:

The first is Match Group. MTCH.

Owner of Tinder/Hinge/Match/OkCupid etc. Household name. Almost every single person I know uses it. Four straight quarters of positive GAAP earnings, over 500M TTM net income, 850M cash on hand, 2.5B TTM revenue, on a market cap of 44B. Around 750M in trailing free cash flow and growing. Only negative I see is that they're highly leveraged after their spin-off from IAC, with 3.8B in long term debt.

Second should be **slam dunk** and that's Zoom. Ticker ZM.

Household name. Used by every single person I know. Every single company in the Russell 2000 (probably except Microsoft and Cisco) uses it and spends a lot of money on it contractually. 872M TTM net income, 9 straight quarters of positive net income, 4.60 BILLION cash on hand which is more than Adobe (!!), zero debt, 1.58B in TTM free cash flow and growing. P/E of 127, which is less than the P/E of similar SaaS S&P component Paycom (PAYC), which has a P/E of 148. Market cap of 108B, which, if today they entered the index, would slot it right between CVS and ServiceNow in market cap. By the way, SaaS peer NOW has a P/E of 724.

Despite these robust financials, which makes it appear to be a mature company, they're growing at a 80%+ growth rate, and frequently hits triple digit growth still.

Let's hear yours.",2021-06-25 13:24:20
581,$ZM TA - Finally Breaking 7 Months of Downtrend,"This one used to get a lot of love on here - but the thing has basically been going straight down for over a half a year - so I'm not surprised retail forgot about it.

Some COVID news coming out recently with the Delta Variant - likely the reason we are choosing now to break this. Also one of the reasons we have seen so much rotation into tech recently.

Regardless, a move up is well overdue.

[$ZM 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/9lpieahqa1871.png?width=2219&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13f080fc811a60611d056b5956864fdeed2f0946)

This is a descending channel dating back to last November. Today, it finally broke up. While we would like a weekly close for confirmation - a daily close is enough to at least scale in **1/2** \- **3/4** a position. 

Now - we should target **428.10, 453.30** resistances on the low end. Above there could even see this **502 - 507** supply zone.

**375** is key support - I'll stop out below here.

My only issue with this is the huge lack of volume - I'd like to see an uptick before the end of the week. Remember - this week is the end of the quarter - lots of funds are rebalancing and shuffling their hands for the next quarter. 

\---

August 20th **450** Calls look optimal - super cheap still.

583,"As a trader/investor there are bad days, weeks, months, even quarters.. We rarely have bad years, so please do not get down on yourself and remember we must live to see another day! Earnings season is coming in full swing and it will be judgement day!","Good evening everyone. I thought it was important to go over this very important topic because I have read a lot about this all over Reddit. Some of the Elite Traders are going thru this. I am front lines with them on a daily basis. I wanted to tell everyone and anyone that it is ok, even the best of us have bad days, weeks, months, quarters....but rarely a year/years. I have been trading since very late 1994 and there is no way I can tell you everything was fine and dandy. The dot com crash of 2000 where I lost 75% off my peak was a true learning experience, and that has never happened again. But yes, I too have bad days, weeks or months. Last year with covid hit I was down about 25%, and that is because I was about 50% cash, had I been all in stocks I would have been down 40-50%...There are alot of lessons learned each time we are down.

It is fair to measure yourself against an index like the SP500 because since its creation it has been up 8% year over year.. However, if last month you were down, and the SP was up 3% it isnt fair to be down on yourself over this! It is cap weighted index where APPL accounts for nearly 25-30% alone! AAPL accounts for 20 of the Nasdaq 100! I too, was down the last few weeks when the market turned upside down. Give yourself some time before you measure yourself against an index or another trader. Do not be so down on yourself and follow the course.

If you want to measure yourself and get angry just look at 50% of the Nasdaq 100 that is off 33-50% off their highs.. Most of us trade tech and growth. Great company's always come back to make newer highs especially if they make cash and have earnings. So if your account is down even 50% but you are down on something solid rest assured it will come back 33-50%, Earnings season kicks off this week. And as long as you have something with earnings if the stock has been beaten down, dont fret this is the perfect time for your company to fight for proper valuation. (TCOM, SGEN, WBA, PTON, ZM, PDD) there are many more that are slammed off their highs, PDD is off 55%! If the company is solid think of this as a blip on the map....

If you are using the market to give you steady income daily, weekly it will be a roller coaster ride. Remember, a stock is a live auction, it rarely tracks the company performance in real time, and momentum/speculation moves stocks faster. That means it is very hard to always be right every single trading day my friends. Do not be so hard on yourself and it is very hard to have a steady flow of income unless you are working with sizeable capital. Dont fret my friends, earnings season is here and most of the stocks I trade have a low PE 20 or so, and they have consistently beat top and bottom line the last few quarters so I await the earnings reports! Please do not be down on yourself just yet.... the earnings reports will give solace! If you have a speculative stock with no earnings, and they lose money and burn cash good luck!",2021-07-11 22:25:48

**Nutra Pharma has filed an updated provisional patent for the protection of their intellectual property surrounding the use of RPI-78M and analogs of the drug as potential counter-measures against organophosphate nerve agent**

Plantation, Florida , July 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Nutra Pharma Corporation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GEPLjue8S4MU5fq81juBD0qIUh4TlGyL8EowiZTe5-haL0mm5NFz-pDTOmGkyIvWMlVUeEekso3Dto0dRCbgovcU2pk2N1KV6ug3KDQzhM0=) (OTC Pink: NPHC), a biotechnology company marketing [Nyloxin®](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DrnopSgGTLliJ2HbT5ov7p-ze7gcXdxiJynQsgPByVMNnD_lbif5SldODnk2d2gQv2Ye_fP6PkPEznImM3OoeQ==), [Pet Pain-Away](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eMWNixzzT0ooZtzzY_cY1iryOJEFzN_CzAYEadCJ4TZu8t8QYzWLG0WCKYYvPTHTym3uUnE2pCBez1Mf8VFQcA==)™, [Luxury Feet](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZmEc2GUS92L7dlPK7D78rqi8lw3JhS5lrW2EIHPc6SR_lAJxemwugCN31I95eyl5zzHa6fVh39247DBcU4IGYg==)™ and [Equine Pain-Away](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_p3RE0dh8hSdXXxRFEQjMqfLgWAO34Vc6o682e2Ef_4vRVzkAWrRHoUof96zNxG28gufwvi48gPMtVGBpq0BLsTyWRFlohgodFhRYK_Nevs=)™ in the over-the-counter (OTC) pain management market and which is also developing treatments for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Pain, announced today that they have filed a new provisional patent to protect their intellectual property surrounding their development of nerve agent counter measures.

""We originally announced this project in early 2018,” stated Rik J Deitsch, Chief Executive Officer of Nutra Pharma. “In much the same way that our therapies protect the nerves of patients with disease, our findings indicate that we may protect against – or at least mitigate the damage caused by - nerve agents that are utilized as chemical weapons; such as sarin gas and VX,” he continued. “As we have pursued this project and gathered additional data, we are now filing new and updated intellectual property surrounding these findings and will be working with experts in the field to have our products in testing shortly. To that end, we will be working with governmental agencies, Universities and private collaborators as we seek to further this research and potentially license the technology,” he concluded.

Nerve agents are identified as a class of phosphorus-containing organic chemicals (organophosphates) that may disrupt the transfer of messages to organs through the nerves. This disruption is caused by the over-stimulation of certain receptors on the surface of the neurons. These same receptors are the target of Nutra Pharma’s drugs, which may block the action of the nerve agents or minimize the damage that they may cause.

RPI-78M was originally derived from an extract of cobra venom and is an antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The drug has a remarkably low toxicity with a very large therapeutic window. Scientific publications have demonstrated that native and modified neurotoxins can protect nerve cells from early cell death. Furthermore, it is expected that RPI-78M may be beneficial in neuromuscular disorders where the activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has been compromised. The proprietary technology is covered by patents describing the application and use of RPI-78M in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

“The company has very encouraging *in vivo* and *in vitro* preclinical data, a demonstrated molecular mechanism of action and a robust scientific rationale for the continued commercial development of its nerve agent counter measure,” reported Dale VanderPutten, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Nutra Pharma. “The use of organophosphate nerve weapons (Soman, VX, Novichok, etc) is unfortunately increasing,” he continued. “The successful use of these weapons by states and terrorist groups regretfully emboldens others to use them as well. These weapons are also becoming increasingly sophisticated without any advancements in new protective agents. We believe that our nAChR-directed countermeasure may provide an important tool for military and civilian defenses against these horrifying weapons,” Dr. VanderPutten concluded.

In November, Nutra Pharma [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9RgPnuVK09vV7C4L0W6gd7yE-bOsnPraSi2YzkDHrhGz5WfOuDoYuvaSkE39tX5yqQtpP23lgfD8pACxd5Tg-gT4PViPaADFniJD-iCB89YWDUV9n75ljjUJUCPeOZAG8pH7NllugIBDYAelCIijwFCYMvVojuwmr_vcmW-aKyj-o2fO6S5nzwekwSHO8CVRWRiAW9XmCAthmUQhzPRD-w==) that Dr. VanderPutten was invited by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency ([DTRA](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DgjUkkx3jdc78gqaeB3VKEhXf86-P76mRwBuwfnYaAEwMpiF7coBfH0vpsTXAPlg)) to present their nerve agent countermeasure technology in a Tech Watch talk to an audience of military and civilian experts in chem/bio defense. Earlier this year, the Company announced that they had engaged new IP attorneys at [Christopher & Weisberg P.A.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eD0EodkHNHWQnOrLlBToQmMlvanUnutfgybxMKWr42HZy5zwqAjfHCjjT30bZvwgc0A2_44_7rA4KLU8hf58zlU_wlY4TF1hAEUJt4y8UMI=) to work on patents and trademarks for Nutra Pharma’s products and technologies. Additionally, the Company announced recently that they had engaged the Washington DC-based government affairs consulting firm, [Vitello Consulting](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WQXR-dK_1xMtzQebhmaAjRqyPtEDLGWrhm6t4HK_8eVUpzfcaYfuVAH-z7_0bSufXbYFMzzKRv1dJlD1nIxjGwkWIvSJmLtSpxNB2avfFCo=) to work with elected officials as well as governmental agencies to increase the awareness of Nutra Pharma’s products and technologies with the goal of improving sales, garnering grants and potentially speeding drug applications.",2021-07-23 09:20:59

588,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 9th, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 9th, 2021.

# **Inflation will be the sizzling topic for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/inflation-will-be-the-sizzling-topic-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-.html)**
*****
> With fresh evidence the labor market is on the mend, investors’ focus shifts to inflation in the coming week and whether it will continue to heat up or show signs of abating.
*****
> There is a series of inflation data expected: the consumer price index and the producer price index, released Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
*****
> Jobs and inflation are two key factors that influence the Federal Reserve in making its decisions on policy. Markets are hanging on anything that will help determine when the central bank will start to step away from the measures it took to support the economy during the pandemic, including its $120 billion per month purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
*****
> Friday’s July jobs report showed a healthy 943,000 increase in payrolls. That gain is enough to spur Fed watchers into thinking the central bank could announce in the next couple of months that it will dial back its support measures. That’s important since ending the bond-buying program is a first step toward raising interest rates. It’s the Fed’s near-zero rate policy that has helped drive the liquidity feeding the stock market’s gains and keeping rates low.
*****
> “I think the keys for the next week are going to be both CPI and PPI. We get some inflation data for consumers and for businesses. Those will be closely watched. Jobless claims as well,” State Street Global Advisors chief investment strategist Michael Arone said.
*****
> “The Fed has made it clear that the labor market is key to what they do next,” he added. “Jobless claims will continue to be an item that gets looked at every week. Then finally we’re going to get consumer sentiment. Those are four things that could be market movers.”
*****
> The Fed has said elevated inflation, running over 5% at the consumer level recently, is just temporary. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect another hot reading for the consumer price index, with core inflation rising 0.4% or 4.3% year over year. The CPI is released Wednesday. Headline inflation was at 5.4% in June, and core, excluding food and energy, was at 4.5%.
*****
> “That 0.4% follows a 0.9% rise in June,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said. “Then you get PPI Thursday and import prices Friday. Import prices have been running hot and import prices are expected to be up 10.5% year-over-year. That follows over 11% the month before.”
*****
> Economists said if there is another strong employment report for August, then that would support the Fed moving to start tapering its bond-buying program. But one wild card for the economy is the course of the latest Covid outbreak and whether it will crimp economic activity and hiring.
*****
> In making a case that inflation is fleeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pointed to what seems to be a temporary sharp jump in used car prices, and also the decline in lumber prices after a sharp run-up. The Fed’s target for inflation is 2%, but policymakers said they will tolerate an average range around 2% before acting, as long as inflation does not stay too high for too long.

> “Used car prices are beginning to show signs of moderation. I’ll argue that ‘you show me used car prices, and I’ll show you rent [rising],’” Boockvar said. ”‘You show me a drop in lumber prices. I’ll show you a 10-year high in aluminum prices.’ Look at natural gas. It’s at a six-year high. It’s broad based.”
*****
> A protracted period of inflation would harm the economy and negatively affect stocks. Corporations so far have been passing along rising costs to their customers in the form of higher prices, but if they can no longer do that at some point, profit margins will shrink.
*****
> # Fed speakers
> There are a few Federal Reserve officials speaking in the week ahead. Market pros are looking to them to help clarify the central bank’s intentions on tapering. The expectation is that the Fed will announce in September or later in the fall that it will taper back its $120 billion a month bond program, starting at the end of the year or early next year.
*****
> The tapering is expected to be gradual and continue for 10 months or more. The Fed’s own forecasts show its first rate hikes happening in 2023.
*****
> More information could come from the Fed when officials gather for their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming at the end of the month. But action is not expected to be taken until the September meeting or later.
*****
> “We have two voters Monday who are speaking and that’s important. Both lean toward tapering,” Boockvar said.
*****
> “You could add a few more voices to this,” he said. “It could be a showdown between [Fed Governor] Lael Brainard and [Chicago Fed President] Charles Evans on one side and [Fed Governor Christopher] Waller and some of these Fed presidents on the other.”
*****
> The bond market has responded to the idea that the Fed could wind down its bond buying policy. The 10-year Treasury yield crept up to 1.29% Friday afternoon, after hitting a low of 1.13% during the week.
*****
> Yields, which move opposite price, had been moving lower on a number of factors, including concerns about Covid disrupting the economy.
*****
> NatWest’s John Briggs said the 10-year yield may now be moving to a new higher range, following the jobs report. “Maybe you’re now instead of a 1.10% to 1.30% range you’re in a 1.20% to 1.40%. Maybe you’re shifting the range a little higher,” he said.
*****
> Briggs said the bond market will be impacted if the inflation number is hotter than expected. “I think it will matter. I’ve always thought the inflation story is the real story anyway. We have rents picking up in the back half of the year. That’s going to keep inflation above 3%. That’s going to be a challenge to the Fed,” he said.
*****
> As for stocks, State Street’s Arone expects the market to continue to “grind higher.”
*****
The Dow and S&P 500 closed at new records Friday. The Dow gained 0.8% for the week, finishing at 35,208, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.9% to 4,436. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week to 14,835.
*****
> Earnings continue to roll out in the coming week, but the volume of the releases drops off dramatically. Reports are expected from Walt Disney, eBay, Wendy’s and others.
*****
> “Earnings season, we’ll be putting behind us. It was stellar. Then we have sort of a vacuum between earnings and Jackson Hole,” Arone said.
*****
> “The market has seemed to take the variant news in stride, but investors are cautious,” he said. “The jobs number does help alleviate some of those growth scare concerns, concerns about the slowdown in growth. Numbers like this certainly help investors with their anxiety about that.”

> # SPY Snoozefest Coming To An End?

> In today's Morning Lineup, we noted how the major US equity indices have been a bit sleepy with each one having risen less than 1% over the five days ending yesterday. As shown below, that lack of volatility actually extends back to the prior week as well. The S&P 500 (SPY) has generally trended in a sideways range over the past two weeks. That was until today. While yesterday's move higher brought SPY to the high end of that recent range, the reaction to the strong NFP report is marking a more distinct breakout.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080621-SPY.png))**

> As for just how narrow of a range SPY has traded in, in the charts below we show the distance (in percentage terms) between the intraday high and low over a rolling ten trading day span. While today's move higher lifted the reading to 1.59%, as of yesterday's close there was only 1.34% between yesterday's intraday high and last Tuesday's intraday low. Going back through the history of SPY, there have only been 146 other days, or just 2% of all days, in which that range was less than 1.5%. In fact, the last time that there was as narrow of a ten-day range as yesterday's reading was the first trading day of 2018.

> # Did You Know Stocks Historically Peak in Early August?

> Hard to believe, but we are in August already! The good news is stocks are still firmly in a bull market, but the bad news is the calendar is a potential worry now. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, August and September have been historically two of the weakest months of the year. In fact, during a post-election year, August has been historically quite poor, with only February worse on average. Turning to September, it has indeed been historically the worst month of the year on average. Don’t forget that last year stocks saw nearly a 10% correction during this troublesome month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Taking this a step further, stocks tend to peak in early August when a new party is in power in the White House. August 6 is the day stocks peak and they don’t bottom until September 25.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Meanwhile, during a post-election year stocks peak on August 3 and bottom on September 24. Again, showing how the next several weeks potentially can be dangerous.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> It isn’t all bad news though. With the economy rebounding and earnings soaring, should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use that as an opportunity to add to core equity positions. “The S&P 500 is up an incredible six months in a row,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What most might not realize is that is a very bullish event. In fact, one year later it has been up 18 of 21 times with nearly a 12% average return. The bull might have a few tricks up his sleeve yet.”

> # Biggest Jump in Bearish Sentiment Since Last Spring

> The S&P 500 has been moving sideways around record highs over the past couple of weeks. As such, bullish sentiment from the AAII was relatively flat this week. After a sizeable 5.6 percentage point jump to 36.2% last week, bullish sentiment fell 0.1 percentage points this week. With that reading, bullish sentiment is still 2 percentage points below the historical average of 38%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Whereas bullish sentiment did not change much, bearish sentiment surged 7.6 percentage points. That was the biggest single-week uptick since June 18th of last year when it rose 9.73 percentage points. At that time though, just under half (47.78%) of respondents reported bearish sentiment compared to only 31.7% today which is only slightly elevated versus the historical average of 30.53%. In fact, the current level of bearish sentiment is now the highest since only February. Put differently, bearish sentiment has been muted recently, and while this week's increase was large, it does not leave sentiment at any sort of extreme level.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bear.png))**

> In spite of the large uptick in respondents reporting as bearish, sentiment continues to favor the bulls. The bull-bear spread remains positive at 4.4.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Given bullish sentiment went little changed, the rise in bearish sentiment borrowed almost entirely from those reporting as neutral. Neutral sentiment fell 7.5 percentage points to 32.2%. That is the lowest reading since the first week of July, and it was the largest week-over-week decline since April 8th. This week now marks the first time in three weeks that neutral was not the predominant sentiment reading.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

589,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 9th, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 9th, 2021.

# **Inflation will be the sizzling topic for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/inflation-will-be-the-sizzling-topic-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-.html)**
*****
> With fresh evidence the labor market is on the mend, investors’ focus shifts to inflation in the coming week and whether it will continue to heat up or show signs of abating.
*****
> There is a series of inflation data expected: the consumer price index and the producer price index, released Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
*****
> Jobs and inflation are two key factors that influence the Federal Reserve in making its decisions on policy. Markets are hanging on anything that will help determine when the central bank will start to step away from the measures it took to support the economy during the pandemic, including its $120 billion per month purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
*****
> Friday’s July jobs report showed a healthy 943,000 increase in payrolls. That gain is enough to spur Fed watchers into thinking the central bank could announce in the next couple of months that it will dial back its support measures. That’s important since ending the bond-buying program is a first step toward raising interest rates. It’s the Fed’s near-zero rate policy that has helped drive the liquidity feeding the stock market’s gains and keeping rates low.
*****
> “I think the keys for the next week are going to be both CPI and PPI. We get some inflation data for consumers and for businesses. Those will be closely watched. Jobless claims as well,” State Street Global Advisors chief investment strategist Michael Arone said.
*****
> “The Fed has made it clear that the labor market is key to what they do next,” he added. “Jobless claims will continue to be an item that gets looked at every week. Then finally we’re going to get consumer sentiment. Those are four things that could be market movers.”
*****
> The Fed has said elevated inflation, running over 5% at the consumer level recently, is just temporary. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect another hot reading for the consumer price index, with core inflation rising 0.4% or 4.3% year over year. The CPI is released Wednesday. Headline inflation was at 5.4% in June, and core, excluding food and energy, was at 4.5%.
*****
> “That 0.4% follows a 0.9% rise in June,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said. “Then you get PPI Thursday and import prices Friday. Import prices have been running hot and import prices are expected to be up 10.5% year-over-year. That follows over 11% the month before.”
*****
> Economists said if there is another strong employment report for August, then that would support the Fed moving to start tapering its bond-buying program. But one wild card for the economy is the course of the latest Covid outbreak and whether it will crimp economic activity and hiring.
*****
> In making a case that inflation is fleeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pointed to what seems to be a temporary sharp jump in used car prices, and also the decline in lumber prices after a sharp run-up. The Fed’s target for inflation is 2%, but policymakers said they will tolerate an average range around 2% before acting, as long as inflation does not stay too high for too long.
*****
> “Used car prices are beginning to show signs of moderation. I’ll argue that ‘you show me used car prices, and I’ll show you rent [rising],’” Boockvar said. ”‘You show me a drop in lumber prices. I’ll show you a 10-year high in aluminum prices.’ Look at natural gas. It’s at a six-year high. It’s broad based.”
*****
> A protracted period of inflation would harm the economy and negatively affect stocks. Corporations so far have been passing along rising costs to their customers in the form of higher prices, but if they can no longer do that at some point, profit margins will shrink.
*****
> # Fed speakers
> There are a few Federal Reserve officials speaking in the week ahead. Market pros are looking to them to help clarify the central bank’s intentions on tapering. The expectation is that the Fed will announce in September or later in the fall that it will taper back its $120 billion a month bond program, starting at the end of the year or early next year.
*****
> The tapering is expected to be gradual and continue for 10 months or more. The Fed’s own forecasts show its first rate hikes happening in 2023.
*****
> More information could come from the Fed when officials gather for their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming at the end of the month. But action is not expected to be taken until the September meeting or later.
*****
> “We have two voters Monday who are speaking and that’s important. Both lean toward tapering,” Boockvar said.
*****
> “You could add a few more voices to this,” he said. “It could be a showdown between [Fed Governor] Lael Brainard and [Chicago Fed President] Charles Evans on one side and [Fed Governor Christopher] Waller and some of these Fed presidents on the other.”
*****
> The bond market has responded to the idea that the Fed could wind down its bond buying policy. The 10-year Treasury yield crept up to 1.29% Friday afternoon, after hitting a low of 1.13% during the week.
*****
> Yields, which move opposite price, had been moving lower on a number of factors, including concerns about Covid disrupting the economy.
*****
> NatWest’s John Briggs said the 10-year yield may now be moving to a new higher range, following the jobs report. “Maybe you’re now instead of a 1.10% to 1.30% range you’re in a 1.20% to 1.40%. Maybe you’re shifting the range a little higher,” he said.
*****
> Briggs said the bond market will be impacted if the inflation number is hotter than expected. “I think it will matter. I’ve always thought the inflation story is the real story anyway. We have rents picking up in the back half of the year. That’s going to keep inflation above 3%. That’s going to be a challenge to the Fed,” he said.
*****
> As for stocks, State Street’s Arone expects the market to continue to “grind higher.”
*****
The Dow and S&P 500 closed at new records Friday. The Dow gained 0.8% for the week, finishing at 35,208, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.9% to 4,436. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week to 14,835.
*****
> Earnings continue to roll out in the coming week, but the volume of the releases drops off dramatically. Reports are expected from Walt Disney, eBay, Wendy’s and others.
*****
> “Earnings season, we’ll be putting behind us. It was stellar. Then we have sort of a vacuum between earnings and Jackson Hole,” Arone said.
*****
> “The market has seemed to take the variant news in stride, but investors are cautious,” he said. “The jobs number does help alleviate some of those growth scare concerns, concerns about the slowdown in growth. Numbers like this certainly help investors with their anxiety about that.”

> # SPY Snoozefest Coming To An End?

> In today's Morning Lineup, we noted how the major US equity indices have been a bit sleepy with each one having risen less than 1% over the five days ending yesterday. As shown below, that lack of volatility actually extends back to the prior week as well. The S&P 500 (SPY) has generally trended in a sideways range over the past two weeks. That was until today. While yesterday's move higher brought SPY to the high end of that recent range, the reaction to the strong NFP report is marking a more distinct breakout.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080621-SPY.png))**

> As for just how narrow of a range SPY has traded in, in the charts below we show the distance (in percentage terms) between the intraday high and low over a rolling ten trading day span. While today's move higher lifted the reading to 1.59%, as of yesterday's close there was only 1.34% between yesterday's intraday high and last Tuesday's intraday low. Going back through the history of SPY, there have only been 146 other days, or just 2% of all days, in which that range was less than 1.5%. In fact, the last time that there was as narrow of a ten-day range as yesterday's reading was the first trading day of 2018.

> # Did You Know Stocks Historically Peak in Early August?

> Hard to believe, but we are in August already! The good news is stocks are still firmly in a bull market, but the bad news is the calendar is a potential worry now. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, August and September have been historically two of the weakest months of the year. In fact, during a post-election year, August has been historically quite poor, with only February worse on average. Turning to September, it has indeed been historically the worst month of the year on average. Don’t forget that last year stocks saw nearly a 10% correction during this troublesome month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Taking this a step further, stocks tend to peak in early August when a new party is in power in the White House. August 6 is the day stocks peak and they don’t bottom until September 25.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Meanwhile, during a post-election year stocks peak on August 3 and bottom on September 24. Again, showing how the next several weeks potentially can be dangerous.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> It isn’t all bad news though. With the economy rebounding and earnings soaring, should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use that as an opportunity to add to core equity positions. “The S&P 500 is up an incredible six months in a row,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What most might not realize is that is a very bullish event. In fact, one year later it has been up 18 of 21 times with nearly a 12% average return. The bull might have a few tricks up his sleeve yet.”

> # Biggest Jump in Bearish Sentiment Since Last Spring

> The S&P 500 has been moving sideways around record highs over the past couple of weeks. As such, bullish sentiment from the AAII was relatively flat this week. After a sizeable 5.6 percentage point jump to 36.2% last week, bullish sentiment fell 0.1 percentage points this week. With that reading, bullish sentiment is still 2 percentage points below the historical average of 38%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Whereas bullish sentiment did not change much, bearish sentiment surged 7.6 percentage points. That was the biggest single-week uptick since June 18th of last year when it rose 9.73 percentage points. At that time though, just under half (47.78%) of respondents reported bearish sentiment compared to only 31.7% today which is only slightly elevated versus the historical average of 30.53%. In fact, the current level of bearish sentiment is now the highest since only February. Put differently, bearish sentiment has been muted recently, and while this week's increase was large, it does not leave sentiment at any sort of extreme level.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bear.png))**

> In spite of the large uptick in respondents reporting as bearish, sentiment continues to favor the bulls. The bull-bear spread remains positive at 4.4.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Given bullish sentiment went little changed, the rise in bearish sentiment borrowed almost entirely from those reporting as neutral. Neutral sentiment fell 7.5 percentage points to 32.2%. That is the lowest reading since the first week of July, and it was the largest week-over-week decline since April 8th. This week now marks the first time in three weeks that neutral was not the predominant sentiment reading.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Financial Services was the leading sector yesterday The top 3 leading industries were Gambling, Resorts & casinos, and Coal. Intraday trading action was decent but still not ideal. Any time the market gets too far away from short term moving averages, intraday action will be provide less favorable conditions. During these times, scanners and watchlists are important. I currently have over 30 watchlists of different stocks I am watching. Gappers are my main priority but occasionally the trading action is range bound, may have big spreads and low volume. If the market opens and I find myself in this type of scenario, I will start going through my watchlists to find ideal charts with liquid markets. If I cannot find anything I like, I will then run a scan to find out where the volume and good opportunities are. Having so many watchlists also helps keep me in tune with the market as I am tracking all IPO's sectors, trends, hot stocks, etc.

Pre-market the SPY is slightly gapping up/neutral once again, and the QQQ is in the same boat after having somewhat of a flat day. It wouldn't surprise me if the QQQ comes back down and tests the 370 breakout area at some point or bases for a bit while the moving averages catch up. There are some good earnings reactions this morning and even with it being a Thursday, this is probably the best Pre-market I have seen all week so maybe today the trading action in gapping stocks will be a bit better. I'll be focused on the earnings plays and 2nd day plays primarily from yesterday. Good luck trading!

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021.

# **A key jobs report in the week ahead could drive the next big market move - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/a-key-jobs-report-in-the-week-ahead-could-drive-the-next-big-market-move.html)**
*****
> With Jackson Hole in the rear-view mirror, August’s employment report could be the next driver for markets.
*****
> Stocks gained in the past week, surging again to new highs Friday after a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The chairman acknowledged that Fed officials expect to taper back their $120 billion a month bond-buying program this year, a first step toward reversing easy policy.
*****
> Powell was speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole, Wyo. symposium, held virtually this year. He said the Fed has seen sufficient progress on inflation, but the labor market has not yet improved enough to start the taper. Importantly, he also emphasized that the wind down of the bond program does not mean the Fed will automatically move on to raise interest rate hikes.
*****
> “Powell has made it clear the Fed is not prepared to raise interest rates anytime soon. The market seems relieved by that. … With some of the economic data already slowing, I think interest rate hikes are far, far away, and investors are happy about that,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the US SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
> Arone said the Fed has so far avoided a “taper tantrum,” similar to the 2013 market sell-off when the Fed announced it was rolling back quantitative easing. Powell’s speech was widely anticipated to clarify the Fed’s position on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, after a number of Fed officials called for the start of a wind down.
*****
> # Jobs are the focal point
*****
> Now, market focus shifts even more fiercely to jobs data, with the release Friday of the August employment report.
*****
> “For sure, the market is going to react,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think it’s important. I think the issue that they’re going to have is unemployment benefits don’t really run out until the beginning of September. It’s really not until you get the October jobs number that you get a more free look at September.”
*****
> The dollar index sank after Powell’s Friday morning speech, as stocks rallied to new highs and Treasury yields fell. Other data in the coming week includes consumer confidence Tuesday and Wednesday’s release of Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data and ADP’s private sector payroll data, a kind of preview for Friday’s government jobs report.
*****
> “I wouldn’t be surprised to see follow-through Monday and Tuesday, but ahead of ADP on Wednesday, I’d look for position adjusting which means weaker stocks and weaker bonds and stronger dollar ahead of the jobs data,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
> He said Powell was dovish, as expected, while still emphasizing that tapering was coming. But the key for markets was that he stressed the end of the program does not mean “tightening” or rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield had risen above 1.35% this week, but fell to 1.3% after Powell spoke Friday.
*****
> # U.S. 10-year Treasury yield
*****
> “The market will get cautious again ahead of the jobs data. Then it’s a new world into September. You have to wait until after the jobs data to see if these moves have sustaining power. This is ‘a buy the rumor, sell the fact’ move,” Chandler said.
*****
> Some market pros had expected an announcement on tapering from the Fed at its September meeting, but that view has now mostly changed to a November or December announcement. “Because of the uncertainty of delta, I think it will take more than the next jobs report,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The disruption to jobs in particular is if schools have to close again.”
*****
> Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 750,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%. In July, the economy created 943,000 jobs and unemployment slid to 5.4%. Education was a big contributor in July, with 261,000 jobs added in public schools and private education.

> “It doesn’t have to be a spectacular number to satisfy their needs,” said Swonk of the August report. “You need a solid jobs number, something north of a half million... I think we’re going to be close to that. They’re going to want to see September employment as well.”
*****
> # Market risks
*****
> State Street’s Arone said the Fed’s discussion of the tapering will be top of mind in the markets, just as the next earnings season rolls around.
*****
> “It will be interesting at a time when the Fed starts taking its foot off the pedal,” he said. “Right now, the bull case continues to be reasonably strong, but markets don’t go straight up. If I was going to key on a specific risk, I’d keep an eye on third quarter earnings reports, and more importantly what corporate executives are saying about next year.”
*****
> Arone said strong earnings has been the biggest driver of market gains, helping investors ignore worries about the spread of the Covid delta variant, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and dysfunction in Washington.
*****
> The market’s summer rally continued in the past week, with the Dow ending at 35,455, up just about 1% for the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ended the week at record highs.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 1.5% at 4,509, and the Nasdaq rose 2.8% to 15,129.
*****
> “The market has been able to ignore all this noise and rally,” he said, adding it would be ironic if it were earnings that caused a sell-off and not a Fed policy change or something else.
*****
> He said the market could get choppy in September and into October, a seasonally weak time of year for stocks.
*****
> “We caught a glimpse of this this quarter, with big tech — where the numbers were beating, but they suggested that future quarters would see slower growth,” Arone said. “Investors didn’t like that, and I think it gave us a glimpse of what happens if it spreads beyond the technology sector to other sectors.”
*****
> There are a few earnings in the coming week, including Zoom Video Monday, Campbell Soup Wednesday, and Hewlett Packard and Broadcom Thursday.
*****
> # Watching Ida
*****
> The oil and gas industry is closely watching Hurricane Ida, which was heading straight for Louisiana. Oil, gasoline and natural gas all rallied Friday, as energy companies shut down Gulf of Mexico production ahead of the storm. Louisiana is also home to a number of refineries.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate futures settled up nearly 2% Friday, at $68.74 per barrel. The benchmark U.S. crude was up more than 10% for the week, its best weekly gain since June 5, 2020.

> # Small Cap Labor Day Rally Getting Underway

> In the below chart, daily data since July 1, 1979 through August 20, 2021 for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ee23ad03da0bcf4a9f8869976521a446/51d39e9e109dc4da-47/s500x750/7dc9cb9b15e57125a71f2475fad23ab6ccd1423e.jpg))**

> In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of today’s close, Russell 2000 is up 13.4% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 19.0% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

*****

> # Small-Caps Bounce

> ln today's Morning Lineup, we noted the inverse correlation between performance this week and market caps. As shown in the major US Indices screen of our Trend Analyzer tool, the two best performers over the past five days have been Micro-Caps (IWC) followed by small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and the Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR). Mid-cap ETFs are the next best performers with high 2% gains then most large cap indices have only risen around 1.5% this week with the exception of the Dow (DIA) which has not even gained 1%. As for where these indices are trading relative to each one's trading range, it is partially a mean reversion story. Small caps were deeply oversold one week ago and are now sitting just below their 50-DMAs. While not to as extreme of a degree, mid-caps were similarly trading a full standard deviation below their 50-DMAs last week. Today, they are on the opposite side of their 50-DMAs and on the verge of overbought readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/indices0827.png))**

> As previously mentioned, small caps like the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) were oversold last week. From a charting perspective, each of these indices' rallies this week are not only bounces from extreme oversold levels, but they also follow brief dips below their 200-DMAs. But whereas the past five days have seen solid gains, yesterday saw IWC and IWM reject their 50-DMAs and the high end of their ranges that have been in place since late July. In other words, even though small caps have led the market this week, they are not out of the woods yet.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWC.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWM.png))**

> Looking at the relative strength lines of small caps like IWC and IWM versus the large cap S&P 500 (SPY) over the past year, the past week's outperformance again is a blip on the radar and has only put a small dent in the longer term trend of underperformance.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-Small-v-Large2.png))**

> Where that is not necessarily the case is small market caps versus the smallest market caps. As shown below, the relative strength line of the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) versus the Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out of the past few months' downtrend over the past few days.

> # 6 Charts on Stocks Making New All-Time Highs

> The S&P 500 Index made yet another new all-time high yesterday, the 50th on the year. “The all-time record for any one year is 77 S&P 500 new all-time highs back in 1995,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, 2021 is currently on pace for 78 new highs. There’s a long way to go, but this has been an amazing year and this is yet another way to show it.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As impressive as 50 new highs is, investors need to remember that new highs happen in clusters that can last decades. We’ve been sharing this chart for years, saying exactly that: previous periods of new highs lasted much longer than most expected. Mark Twain said history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. If history rhymes once again, we could still have several more years of new highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Another interesting stat about S&P 500 all-time highs is every month so far in 2021 has seen a new high, 8 for 8. Only once have all 12 months made a new all-time high and that was in 2014. This is somewhat surprising, given the S&P 500 gained only 11.4% in 2014, but it was a very slow and persistent move. Most investors (including this author) would guess it was 1995, but that spectacular year saw new highs in ‘only’ 10 months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Although August tends to be historically weak for stocks, that hasn’t been the case this year. In fact, the S&P 500 has made an incredible 9 new highs already this month, the most since 1929. No, we don’t think this is another 1929, but this is just another way to show how astounding this bull run has been.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-4.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 50 new S&P 500 all-time highs before the end of August is quite a feat. In fact, only twice has the 50 level been cracked through the end of August, in 1964 and 1995.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-5.png?ssl=1))**

> So what happens next? The rest of the year in 1964 the S&P 500 added 3.6%, while it added 9.6% in 1995. Below we looked at all the years with at least 30 new all-time highs through August and sure enough, better than average returns the rest of the year are common. The final 4 months gained 4.7%, versus the average final 4 months gain for all years of 3.6%. Now this is skewed due to 1987s crash, as that was the only time stocks were lower the final 4 months after more than 30 new highs by the end of August. Smoothing things out, the median return jumps up to a very impressive 5.4%, versus a median return of 3.6% for all years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-6.png?ssl=1))**

> 2021 is off to a roaring start and we continue to expect higher prices before all is said and done. The studies we did today do little to change our view. We’d use any potential weakness as an opportunity to add before potential higher prices.

> # Nasdaq Crosses Another 1,000 Point Threshold

> It won't be official until the close, but with the Nasdaq crossing 15,000 for the first time today, it's on pace to cross its third 1,000 point threshold this year and the sixth since the pandemic began in early 2020. The table below lists each 1,000 point threshold that the Nasdaq has crossed over time along with the first day that it crossed that threshold, the number of days since the prior cross, what percentage that 1,000 point consists of relative to the prior threshold, and then how many upside and downside crosses the Nasdaq has had around that level on a closing basis.

> Of all the 1,000 point thresholds the Nasdaq has crossed over time, the only one that it never traded back below after crossing it was 6,000 back in April 2017. Besides 1,000, that was also the 1,000 point threshold that took the longest to cross above. After first crossing 5,000 back in March 2000, it took 6,256 days for the Nasdaq to top 6,000. Since then, though, the Nasdaq has been making quick work of 1,000 point thresholds. With the exception of the 486-day gap between 8K and 9K, every other 1,000-point threshold since 6,000 has taken less than a year to cross. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, it took the Nasdaq less than six months to get from 9,000 to 10,000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-Crosses.png))**

> The long-term chart of the Nasdaq below includes red dots to show each time the Nasdaq first crossed a 1,000 point threshold along with the number of days for each one.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-1000-Point-thresholds.png))**

> Looking at the chart above may give you a feeling of lightheadedness given the seemingly parabolic nature of the last few years. An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that as a percentage of the index's price level, every 1,000 point threshold represents a smaller move in percentage terms. While the move from 9K to 10K represented a move of over 11%, the move from 14K to 15K represents only a little more than 7%. Looking at this chart on a log scale where each label on the y-axis represents a doubling of the index shows how modest the recent 1,000 point thresholds have been relative to earlier ones. Think about it this way, in the less than two years between when the Nasdaq first crossed 2K to when it crossed 5K for the first time (four different 1,000 point thresholds), it rallied 150%. Over the last four years, though, the Nasdaq has crossed 10 different 1,000-point thresholds, but the gain has also only been 150%.

> # Bulls Head In Separate Directions

>As the major indices have set more record highs in the past week, bullish sentiment has rebounded. The American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose 6.4 percentage points to 39.4% this week. That is the highest reading of optimism since the week of July 8th when bullish sentiment was a hair above 40%. While recovered, that reading is still muted versus the past year's range and is only 1.5 percentage points above their historical average. In other words, bullish sentiment has rebounded but is far from elevated.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While the AAII survey showed an increase in bullish sentiment, another survey of newsletter writers from Investors Intelligence saw the opposite result. This survey's reading on bullish sentiment dropped to just 50% this week which is the lowest level since May of last year. Although this reading has now fallen out of the past year's range, it is still slightly elevated versus the historical average of 45%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-II-Bull.png))**

> Given the uptick in bullish sentiment, the AAII survey saw only a third of respondents report as bearish versus 35.1% last week. Like bullish sentiment, this reading remains outside of the range it has occupied for most of the past year although that current reading is also not far away from the historical average of 30.5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> As we noted in last Thursday's Chart of the Day, the bull-bear spread dipped into negative territory last week for the first time since late January and it was at the lowest level since October 2020. With the inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment this week, the spread has moved back into positive territory to its highest level since the last week of July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Not all of the gains to bullish sentiment came from the bearish camp. Neutral sentiment saw an even larger decline of 4.2 percentage points. That brings the reading down to 27.5% which is the lowest reading since April 15th when it stood at just 21.6%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",2021-08-28 08:25:41
593,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021.

# **A key jobs report in the week ahead could drive the next big market move - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/a-key-jobs-report-in-the-week-ahead-could-drive-the-next-big-market-move.html)**
*****
> With Jackson Hole in the rear-view mirror, August’s employment report could be the next driver for markets.
*****
> Stocks gained in the past week, surging again to new highs Friday after a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The chairman acknowledged that Fed officials expect to taper back their $120 billion a month bond-buying program this year, a first step toward reversing easy policy.
*****
> Powell was speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole, Wyo. symposium, held virtually this year. He said the Fed has seen sufficient progress on inflation, but the labor market has not yet improved enough to start the taper. Importantly, he also emphasized that the wind down of the bond program does not mean the Fed will automatically move on to raise interest rate hikes.
*****
> “Powell has made it clear the Fed is not prepared to raise interest rates anytime soon. The market seems relieved by that. … With some of the economic data already slowing, I think interest rate hikes are far, far away, and investors are happy about that,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the US SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
> Arone said the Fed has so far avoided a “taper tantrum,” similar to the 2013 market sell-off when the Fed announced it was rolling back quantitative easing. Powell’s speech was widely anticipated to clarify the Fed’s position on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, after a number of Fed officials called for the start of a wind down.
*****
> # Jobs are the focal point
*****
> Now, market focus shifts even more fiercely to jobs data, with the release Friday of the August employment report.
*****
> “For sure, the market is going to react,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think it’s important. I think the issue that they’re going to have is unemployment benefits don’t really run out until the beginning of September. It’s really not until you get the October jobs number that you get a more free look at September.”
*****
> The dollar index sank after Powell’s Friday morning speech, as stocks rallied to new highs and Treasury yields fell. Other data in the coming week includes consumer confidence Tuesday and Wednesday’s release of Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data and ADP’s private sector payroll data, a kind of preview for Friday’s government jobs report.
*****
> “I wouldn’t be surprised to see follow-through Monday and Tuesday, but ahead of ADP on Wednesday, I’d look for position adjusting which means weaker stocks and weaker bonds and stronger dollar ahead of the jobs data,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
> He said Powell was dovish, as expected, while still emphasizing that tapering was coming. But the key for markets was that he stressed the end of the program does not mean “tightening” or rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield had risen above 1.35% this week, but fell to 1.3% after Powell spoke Friday.
*****
> # U.S. 10-year Treasury yield
*****
> “The market will get cautious again ahead of the jobs data. Then it’s a new world into September. You have to wait until after the jobs data to see if these moves have sustaining power. This is ‘a buy the rumor, sell the fact’ move,” Chandler said.
*****
> Some market pros had expected an announcement on tapering from the Fed at its September meeting, but that view has now mostly changed to a November or December announcement. “Because of the uncertainty of delta, I think it will take more than the next jobs report,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The disruption to jobs in particular is if schools have to close again.”
*****
> Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 750,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%. In July, the economy created 943,000 jobs and unemployment slid to 5.4%. Education was a big contributor in July, with 261,000 jobs added in public schools and private education.
*****
> “It doesn’t have to be a spectacular number to satisfy their needs,” said Swonk of the August report. “You need a solid jobs number, something north of a half million... I think we’re going to be close to that. They’re going to want to see September employment as well.”
*****
> # Market risks
*****
> State Street’s Arone said the Fed’s discussion of the tapering will be top of mind in the markets, just as the next earnings season rolls around.
*****
> “It will be interesting at a time when the Fed starts taking its foot off the pedal,” he said. “Right now, the bull case continues to be reasonably strong, but markets don’t go straight up. If I was going to key on a specific risk, I’d keep an eye on third quarter earnings reports, and more importantly what corporate executives are saying about next year.”
*****
> Arone said strong earnings has been the biggest driver of market gains, helping investors ignore worries about the spread of the Covid delta variant, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and dysfunction in Washington.
*****
> The market’s summer rally continued in the past week, with the Dow ending at 35,455, up just about 1% for the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ended the week at record highs.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 1.5% at 4,509, and the Nasdaq rose 2.8% to 15,129.
*****
> “The market has been able to ignore all this noise and rally,” he said, adding it would be ironic if it were earnings that caused a sell-off and not a Fed policy change or something else.
*****
> He said the market could get choppy in September and into October, a seasonally weak time of year for stocks.
*****
> “We caught a glimpse of this this quarter, with big tech — where the numbers were beating, but they suggested that future quarters would see slower growth,” Arone said. “Investors didn’t like that, and I think it gave us a glimpse of what happens if it spreads beyond the technology sector to other sectors.”
*****
> There are a few earnings in the coming week, including Zoom Video Monday, Campbell Soup Wednesday, and Hewlett Packard and Broadcom Thursday.
*****
> # Watching Ida
*****
> The oil and gas industry is closely watching Hurricane Ida, which was heading straight for Louisiana. Oil, gasoline and natural gas all rallied Friday, as energy companies shut down Gulf of Mexico production ahead of the storm. Louisiana is also home to a number of refineries.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate futures settled up nearly 2% Friday, at $68.74 per barrel. The benchmark U.S. crude was up more than 10% for the week, its best weekly gain since June 5, 2020.

> # Small Cap Labor Day Rally Getting Underway

> In the below chart, daily data since July 1, 1979 through August 20, 2021 for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ee23ad03da0bcf4a9f8869976521a446/51d39e9e109dc4da-47/s500x750/7dc9cb9b15e57125a71f2475fad23ab6ccd1423e.jpg))**

> In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of today’s close, Russell 2000 is up 13.4% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 19.0% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

*****

> # Small-Caps Bounce

> ln today's Morning Lineup, we noted the inverse correlation between performance this week and market caps. As shown in the major US Indices screen of our Trend Analyzer tool, the two best performers over the past five days have been Micro-Caps (IWC) followed by small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and the Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR). Mid-cap ETFs are the next best performers with high 2% gains then most large cap indices have only risen around 1.5% this week with the exception of the Dow (DIA) which has not even gained 1%. As for where these indices are trading relative to each one's trading range, it is partially a mean reversion story. Small caps were deeply oversold one week ago and are now sitting just below their 50-DMAs. While not to as extreme of a degree, mid-caps were similarly trading a full standard deviation below their 50-DMAs last week. Today, they are on the opposite side of their 50-DMAs and on the verge of overbought readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/indices0827.png))**

> As previously mentioned, small caps like the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) were oversold last week. From a charting perspective, each of these indices' rallies this week are not only bounces from extreme oversold levels, but they also follow brief dips below their 200-DMAs. But whereas the past five days have seen solid gains, yesterday saw IWC and IWM reject their 50-DMAs and the high end of their ranges that have been in place since late July. In other words, even though small caps have led the market this week, they are not out of the woods yet.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWM.png))**

> Looking at the relative strength lines of small caps like IWC and IWM versus the large cap S&P 500 (SPY) over the past year, the past week's outperformance again is a blip on the radar and has only put a small dent in the longer term trend of underperformance.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-Small-v-Large2.png))**

> Where that is not necessarily the case is small market caps versus the smallest market caps. As shown below, the relative strength line of the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) versus the Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out of the past few months' downtrend over the past few days.

> # 6 Charts on Stocks Making New All-Time Highs

> The S&P 500 Index made yet another new all-time high yesterday, the 50th on the year. “The all-time record for any one year is 77 S&P 500 new all-time highs back in 1995,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, 2021 is currently on pace for 78 new highs. There’s a long way to go, but this has been an amazing year and this is yet another way to show it.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As impressive as 50 new highs is, investors need to remember that new highs happen in clusters that can last decades. We’ve been sharing this chart for years, saying exactly that: previous periods of new highs lasted much longer than most expected. Mark Twain said history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. If history rhymes once again, we could still have several more years of new highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Another interesting stat about S&P 500 all-time highs is every month so far in 2021 has seen a new high, 8 for 8. Only once have all 12 months made a new all-time high and that was in 2014. This is somewhat surprising, given the S&P 500 gained only 11.4% in 2014, but it was a very slow and persistent move. Most investors (including this author) would guess it was 1995, but that spectacular year saw new highs in ‘only’ 10 months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Although August tends to be historically weak for stocks, that hasn’t been the case this year. In fact, the S&P 500 has made an incredible 9 new highs already this month, the most since 1929. No, we don’t think this is another 1929, but this is just another way to show how astounding this bull run has been.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-4.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 50 new S&P 500 all-time highs before the end of August is quite a feat. In fact, only twice has the 50 level been cracked through the end of August, in 1964 and 1995.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-5.png?ssl=1))**

> So what happens next? The rest of the year in 1964 the S&P 500 added 3.6%, while it added 9.6% in 1995. Below we looked at all the years with at least 30 new all-time highs through August and sure enough, better than average returns the rest of the year are common. The final 4 months gained 4.7%, versus the average final 4 months gain for all years of 3.6%. Now this is skewed due to 1987s crash, as that was the only time stocks were lower the final 4 months after more than 30 new highs by the end of August. Smoothing things out, the median return jumps up to a very impressive 5.4%, versus a median return of 3.6% for all years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-6.png?ssl=1))**

> 2021 is off to a roaring start and we continue to expect higher prices before all is said and done. The studies we did today do little to change our view. We’d use any potential weakness as an opportunity to add before potential higher prices.

> # Nasdaq Crosses Another 1,000 Point Threshold

> It won't be official until the close, but with the Nasdaq crossing 15,000 for the first time today, it's on pace to cross its third 1,000 point threshold this year and the sixth since the pandemic began in early 2020. The table below lists each 1,000 point threshold that the Nasdaq has crossed over time along with the first day that it crossed that threshold, the number of days since the prior cross, what percentage that 1,000 point consists of relative to the prior threshold, and then how many upside and downside crosses the Nasdaq has had around that level on a closing basis.

> Of all the 1,000 point thresholds the Nasdaq has crossed over time, the only one that it never traded back below after crossing it was 6,000 back in April 2017. Besides 1,000, that was also the 1,000 point threshold that took the longest to cross above. After first crossing 5,000 back in March 2000, it took 6,256 days for the Nasdaq to top 6,000. Since then, though, the Nasdaq has been making quick work of 1,000 point thresholds. With the exception of the 486-day gap between 8K and 9K, every other 1,000-point threshold since 6,000 has taken less than a year to cross. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, it took the Nasdaq less than six months to get from 9,000 to 10,000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-Crosses.png))**

> The long-term chart of the Nasdaq below includes red dots to show each time the Nasdaq first crossed a 1,000 point threshold along with the number of days for each one.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-1000-Point-thresholds.png))**

> Looking at the chart above may give you a feeling of lightheadedness given the seemingly parabolic nature of the last few years. An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that as a percentage of the index's price level, every 1,000 point threshold represents a smaller move in percentage terms. While the move from 9K to 10K represented a move of over 11%, the move from 14K to 15K represents only a little more than 7%. Looking at this chart on a log scale where each label on the y-axis represents a doubling of the index shows how modest the recent 1,000 point thresholds have been relative to earlier ones. Think about it this way, in the less than two years between when the Nasdaq first crossed 2K to when it crossed 5K for the first time (four different 1,000 point thresholds), it rallied 150%. Over the last four years, though, the Nasdaq has crossed 10 different 1,000-point thresholds, but the gain has also only been 150%.

> # Bulls Head In Separate Directions

>As the major indices have set more record highs in the past week, bullish sentiment has rebounded. The American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose 6.4 percentage points to 39.4% this week. That is the highest reading of optimism since the week of July 8th when bullish sentiment was a hair above 40%. While recovered, that reading is still muted versus the past year's range and is only 1.5 percentage points above their historical average. In other words, bullish sentiment has rebounded but is far from elevated.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While the AAII survey showed an increase in bullish sentiment, another survey of newsletter writers from Investors Intelligence saw the opposite result. This survey's reading on bullish sentiment dropped to just 50% this week which is the lowest level since May of last year. Although this reading has now fallen out of the past year's range, it is still slightly elevated versus the historical average of 45%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-II-Bull.png))**

> Given the uptick in bullish sentiment, the AAII survey saw only a third of respondents report as bearish versus 35.1% last week. Like bullish sentiment, this reading remains outside of the range it has occupied for most of the past year although that current reading is also not far away from the historical average of 30.5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> As we noted in last Thursday's Chart of the Day, the bull-bear spread dipped into negative territory last week for the first time since late January and it was at the lowest level since October 2020. With the inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment this week, the spread has moved back into positive territory to its highest level since the last week of July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Not all of the gains to bullish sentiment came from the bearish camp. Neutral sentiment saw an even larger decline of 4.2 percentage points. That brings the reading down to 27.5% which is the lowest reading since April 15th when it stood at just 21.6%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",2021-08-28 08:29:09
594,Puts on Zoom ($ZM) earnings tonight,"Edit: it would appear I did the assignment wrong but still arrived at the correct answer

&#x200B;

Zoom reports tonight and I think their report will be shit. They are expected to report USD 990 million in revenue, a 3.5% increase from the last quarter. I expect their revenue to drop from last quarter, leading to a selloff.

Reason: use of Zoom is down as much as 33% in Q2 compared to Q1. To a degree this is expected due to seasonality/return to work, but I believe it will make it difficult for them to actually improve on their Q1 with these results

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/omkjws8m1ik71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54591d1e57d956d87c176dac3211f14161a2d6c0

Many people in countries with high vaccination rates have seen pretty dramatic drops in the popularity of the Zoom app recently:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oz2geblm1ik71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a6eb8fb6b78eabadcd5857287edb53740f651cab

**Reasons why this theory might not work out**

&#x200B;

* It's already priced in
* Options      are expensive and you get theta crushed
* Most of Zoom's revenue is      subscription (monthly/annual) based, not usage or volume based. A      decrease in call volumes in Q2 doesn’t mean that their revenue/earnings actually      decreased as dramatically as I’m predicting
* Analysts were already expecting      bad results and priced them in
* Zoom releases spectacular      numbers for Zoom phone, their new product that is meant to diversify their      offerings
* Cathie      Woods might buy out the company for USD 667 per share
* Zoom is already down a lot from      its ATH, it could also see a bounce back up

&#x200B;

**My position:**

**Gap Ups:** ACIU, APPS, BILI, CAN, CRSR, DBI, GME, JD, LEDS, NTES, PDD, RDHL, RHE, RSKD, TSM, YNDX, ZEV

**Gap Downs**: CRWD, FIVN, HOOD, NVDA, STNE, ZM

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Communication Services was the leading sector yesterday. Consumer Electronics, Education & Training Services, and REIT - Residential were the leading industries. Intraday action was not ideal but wasn't too bad if you were in the right Places. Big Tech continues to push the market higher, the only problem with day trading big tech is that the opportunities for growth are not the same as they are with trading small or mid caps. For example AAPL had a big day but only moved 3% where as RNXT moved 100%.

SPY and QQQ both slightly lower pre-market. Both indices are far away from short term moving averages so we could have a sell off day but I won't expect anything, I will look for both long and short opportunities as usual. Not too many good gappers pre-market, if it remains that way, I will run a scan after the open to find stocks moving on volume and catalyst. Good luck trading!

\**I do not add stocks under $5. If there is a stock that is under $5 here, it was above $5 when I added it. The reason being is that most penny stocks halt which is very risky and they are also highly manipulated*\*

596,"Morning Update for Tuesday, 08/31/21","Good morning everyone, happy Tuesday :)

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* BABA
* CRSR
* NTES
* PDD
* JD
* APPS
* AMC

Gapping DOWN:

* ZM
* FIVN
* HOOD
* MARA
* AFRM

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* ACIU (+67%): Up after announcing positive cognitive results for an antibody for Alzheimer's disease. Seeing strong volume and price action in premarket trading, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues. Looking to test 12-12.30 area as resistance, dating back a while on the daily chart. 
* RHE (+35%): Couldn't find a relevant catalyst. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, with a premarket high of 13.48. I'll be watching price action around the possible resistance/support level of 12.
* ZEV (+8%): Up after announcing agreement to enter the electric school bus space. Seeing okay volume and price action at the moment. Tested 10 as resistance in premarket trading, I'll be watching that resistance level closely. 
* SYTA (+29%): Couldn't find a relevant catalyst. Seeing some weakness in price action at the moment, but I'll be watching to see if it turns around. I'll be watching to see if it can find support around the 4.80-5.00 area.
* PALI (+17%): Up after recent insider buying, as well as a new price target from Maxim. Seeing decent price action in premarket after seeing a spike yesterday afternoon, but I'll want to see volume pick up more. Premarket high of 3.35.
* LIZI (+5%): Up after reporting earnings. I'll be watching for continuation from yesterday's trading, but I'll want to see volume pick up first as well. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open after we had a strong day overall in the market yesterday. The S&P 500 has gained nearly 21% year-to-date, and this is a bit concerning to me. Some analysts think tapering is already priced in and we should see more strength to close out the rest of the year. I'm not convinced that the negative influential factors are priced in (not only tapering, but also future COVID fears, potential growth slowdown, and inflation looming in the background). Business as usual if we continue to see strength, but I'll be watching for potential weakness, and we could be in for some choppiness. 

SPY is trading a bit over 451. I'll be watching 451 and 450 as potential support levels, but if we hold up above 451 we could see a further push to ATH. DIA is trading a bit under 354. If it sees weakness, I'll be watching 352 as a key support level. QQQ is trading a bit under 380 and is in a similar technical area compared to SPY. Gold and silver are trading slightly higher this morning, while crude oil is down a bit. Bitcoin is currently trading around 47,900. After some choppiness the past few days, I'll be watching closely. With the recent consolidation, we could be in for a break in either direction. Crypto-related stocks are down a bit in premarket trading, and I'll be keeping a close eye on them with regards to Bitcoin's price action today. Airlines and cruise stocks are down a bit in premarket trading after seeing weakness in yesterday's session. The charts are not looking great, and the weakness could continue. Meme stocks continue to see increased attention, I'll be watching GME and AMC closely.

601,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 31, 2021","The rally in equities somewhat cooled today, with all three major indexes trading modestly red today but are on track to close out a stellar month, with the S&P 500 (SPY) gaining more than 2.5% in August, its seven straight month of gains. So far, the SPY is up a staggering 20% year-to-date. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech by Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants await a busy week for new economic data, with the August Jobs Report due out on Thursday.

BMO Capital Markets became the latest financial firm to raise its end of the year price target for the SPY. Brian Belski, the company’s Chief Investment Strategist, wrote in a note to clients that he now expects the index to end the year at $480, up from his original estimate of $450. He cites the “blistering rate” of corporate earnings amid a strengthening economic backdrop. 

Despite hawkish statements by other Federal Reserve members in the July meeting minutes, in his speech Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, “At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue.”

Powell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would “arrive after the need has passed” and “could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, “The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.”

Here is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It’s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy-maker thinks of the current state of the economy

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)

James Liu, Founder and CEO of Clearnomics, said of Powell’s speech, “We do think that tapering, in general, will be a non-event, most likely because first, the market has had time to react throughout this year. The Fed has done a great job telegraphing this. Whether it’s September or November for the announcement of taper will really depend on the jobs report coming up and some more economic data. But regardless, the market seems to expect it at this point. This is very different from 2013 when the market had to adjust very abruptly to taper.” In my humble opinion, I totally agree with this sentiment.

604,"Zen Graphene with 'Paradigm Changing Applications' in Healthcare, Green Energy, and Materials Science","Disclosure: I currently own 26,000 shares of Zen.v at a $2.9 CAD cost-basis, writer of the article also retains a long position on the stock at hand.

I have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.

Edited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.

**Short term Risks:**

HC Approval. In the short term, it’s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-

(more questions that delay things beyond, let’s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection – neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)

\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as “Inning 1.” If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan’s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.

**Investment Thesis:**

***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.

Risks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.

The business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a ""must own"" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.

**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**

ZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (“graphene-enhanced” technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won’t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.

**Three Initial Target Markets:**

*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*

1. Personal Protective Equipment (""PPE,"" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),
2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and
3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let’s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

ZEN’s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.

The next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company’s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN’s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.

**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**

This is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That’s when things are “normal” (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.

There are over 6,000 hospitals.

There are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.

There are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.

And all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.

**Detection and Sensors:**

The company’s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.

Imagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.

Please see the company’s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.

**Therapeutics:**

Down the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won’t cost much to pursue in the short term, I’ll address them at a later time.

**The Model:**

The company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in “masks equivalent” (“me”). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.

**Margins:**

Assuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we’re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.

**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.

**Expenses:**

Expect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they’re hiring at least a few heads.

For the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they’ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.

**Capex:**

Assume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.

Obviously, since they’re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.

Let’s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they’re selling out the 25M mpd. That’s:

25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue

x 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)

x 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)

= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)

(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)

**Balance Sheet:**

With $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn’t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company’s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.

I’m okay with that: a company that doesn’t need to raise money won’t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don’t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.

If they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you’ll see it’s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.

**Misc:**

Lock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).

**Insider Buying:**

The CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.

**Summary:**

* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing “must have” products, rather than “nice to have” ones.
* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.
* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.
* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.
* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.",2021-09-02 13:13:12
605,"Zen Graphene with 'Paradigm Changing Applications' in Healthcare, Green Energy, and Materials Science","Disclosure: I currently own 26,000 shares of Zen.v at a $2.9 CAD cost-basis, writer of the article also retains a long position on the stock at hand.

I have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.

Edited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.

**Short term Risks:**

HC Approval. In the short term, it’s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-

(more questions that delay things beyond, let’s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection – neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)

\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as “Inning 1.” If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan’s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.

**Investment Thesis:**

***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.

Risks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.

The business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a ""must own"" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.

**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**

ZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (“graphene-enhanced” technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won’t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.

**Three Initial Target Markets:**

*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*

1. Personal Protective Equipment (""PPE,"" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),
2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and
3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let’s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

ZEN’s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.

The next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company’s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN’s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.

**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**

This is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That’s when things are “normal” (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.

There are over 6,000 hospitals.

There are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.

There are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.

And all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.

**Detection and Sensors:**

The company’s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.

Imagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.

Please see the company’s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.

**Therapeutics:**

Down the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won’t cost much to pursue in the short term, I’ll address them at a later time.

**The Model:**

The company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in “masks equivalent” (“me”). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.

**Margins:**

Assuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we’re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.

**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.

**Expenses:**

Expect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they’re hiring at least a few heads.

For the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they’ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.

**Capex:**

Assume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.

Obviously, since they’re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.

Let’s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they’re selling out the 25M mpd. That’s:

25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue

x 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)

x 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)

= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)

(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)

**Balance Sheet:**

With $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn’t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company’s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.

I’m okay with that: a company that doesn’t need to raise money won’t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don’t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.

If they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you’ll see it’s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.

**Misc:**

Lock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).

**Insider Buying:**

The CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.

607,What do you feel have been your 5 most profitable tickers this year? Whether it be from trades or long term hold? Let us help each other,"Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post. Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.

We all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called “Plays” this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!

Please try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:

My 5 as a Day Trader:

RKT – This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar

UWMC – This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents

TIGR – This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)

CPNG – I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)

CRSR – I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)

These are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore

BILL – This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100… I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it

MRNA – I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100…

SE – I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus

CMG – OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 shares… What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining in the basement????

ZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!

I hope this helps others get an idea and thank you everyone.",2021-09-05 09:19:06

610,Oil producers and my favorite from this sector,"Given the fact that interest rates are very low, I have been looking at ways to invest in dividend payors. I have a pretty heavy growth stock tilt in my portfolio and I know that oil companies have been negatively correlated with growth stock performance.

With this in mind, I have been thinking about starting a position in an oil company, but I want to make sure the company is performing well enough to survive. I used [wiijii.co](https://wiijii.co/) for my analysis, but I am going to walk through my thought process here.

First, looking just at economies of scale and sheer size, $XOM is the largest by far and $OXY is the smallest -> as shown [here](https://wiijii.co/chart/?id=-MjZlw_3zq8DuNUlJ_3V). Second, if we move down the income statement to take a look at $XOM on a gross profit basis we can see that it appears attractive compared to some of the other stocks [here](https://wiijii.co/chart/?id=-MjZmNM5P64n4Zpfsrmz). At this point, I am leaning toward $XOM especially because of the takeover from Engine 1. But then I took things to the final step and compared them on an EBITDA basis as shown [here](https://wiijii.co/chart/?id=-MjZmXPBfQHfJV7RyNua). Now I chose to use EBITDA because it is a proxy for cash flow which can be used to pay out that dividend. Remember I am going for high dividends. $OXY stands out as the CLEAR leader with the lowest EV/EBITDA multiple and the highest EBITDA margin.

OXY is owned by Buffet which is a huge plus and OXY isn't pushing hard into renewables instead focusing on returning capital to shareholders. Now I have a lot of ""clean energy"" based investments so I view this as a positive for diversification reasons.

Does anyone have more thoughts?",2021-09-14 11:33:47
611,ZM DD (STFU Slim Jim Cramerrrr),"Firstly, I am retarded. So take that for what it is. Anyways, for the last few weeks, all the media has been saying is to prepare for a pullback across the market. I heard Boomer Boy Cramer talking about how if big tech rolls over, it could cause the market to spiral downwards.

Right after saying the market will pull back, the media will go into how the delta variant will spread and how it's going to be oh so bad. 

Here's my DD:

ZM was absolutely beaten down on 8/30 & 8/31. The stock is already in buying range and will have less downside if the market does pull back. Now, if the delta variant does spread, we will likely see schools shut down, businesses go back to work from home, and government agencies tighten rules surrounding covid. If that happens, ZM will benefit massively.

Could this be the perfect hedge against the market pulling back due to technicals (overextended) and fundamentals (delta variant)???

Maybe I'll start small and use my vehicle's title as collateral and then dollar-cost average with the deed to my house. Perhaps I'll need to use my monthly allowance from my wife's boyfriend to buy some dips along the way as well.

Curious to hear another ape's thoughts.",2021-09-15 15:27:09

It’s been dropping since the 2Q earning. I think it’s in the fair value range but some may think otherwise. What’s your thoughts? Does it have a chance to hit 290s in the next few trading days?,2021-09-15 16:49:28
613,How to Play the Current Market Drop,"Several times this year **SPY** has broken through the lower end of its' upward sloping channel.  On 1/29, 3/4, 6/18, 7/19 the price fell below the SMA 50 on the daily chart, and closed below it.

Each time **SPY** bounced back the following day, reestablishing the 50 as a major line of support for the ETF.  After the next day closed above support, the market continued on to establish a new ATH.

Will that happen on Monday?  We will soon find out, but I certainly hope it doesn't.

If **SPY** continues to drop, it will be the first time this year that a break of major support had continuation.  At that point, 436 and 431.78 become the next two targets for a major breach.

Either way - *do not anticipate a move, wait for confirmation before acting on it.* In other words, don't start buying *calls* or going long on **/ES** futures thinking you can predict a bottom.  You can't.  It will become clear when **SPY** has established support and it's ready to rebound.

Here's what you should be doing though - making your list of stocks that are gaining strength ahead of **SPY**.  Stocks like **UPST, ETSY,** and **DASH** have all been pushing upwards during this market decline.   The next list should be of stocks that that are currently holding major support areas (**MSFT, FB,** and **AMZN** for example) - these stocks have been dragged down by a bearish market trend, but also have been able to hold support (unlike **AAPL** which broke through).

When **SPY** finally does finds support, this is your opportunity for some high probability trades.  An opportunity you do not want to waste by trying to get ahead of it.

This means that the first thing you will need to do is, *be patient*.  This is much harder to do than it sounds of course.  You'll see **SPY** bouncing back up and watching the stocks on your list bounce up with it.  At this point you might think, ""I am missing it, I need to get in now!"".  *No you don't*.  Wait.  Make sure the market isn't just chopping around, and then getting ready for another leg down. Much like it did from Monday - Thursday of last week.

When the market finally begins to reverse it will be clear - and it is at this point you want to start putting on Put Credit Spreads, Call Debit Spreads, Straight Calls, and Long Stock among those tickers you have been watching.  For example - let's say the market continues to drop and heads down to 431 (SMA 100), where it stabilizes and then begins to bounce back upwards.  At the same point you notice that **AMZN** is resting on it's SMA 100 around 3400.  As the market starts to go back up, so will **AMZN**, most likely recapturing its SMA 50 (3450).  You could do a Put Credit Spread of 3395/3390 for 3 weeks out and probably get a credit of roughly $1.50 for it, which is a 43% ROI.  You'll have two major lines of support above your short strike, giving you a lot of cushion on this trade.  You could also do a Call Debit Spread ATM of 3455/3460 for a debit under $2.50, as well.  Your risk is defined by your debit, which is less than 50% of the distance in the strike prices.

Perhaps **MSFT** dropped down to $292, right on its SMA 50, and is also showing Relative Strength to **SPY** \- if so you can do a one month out ITM calls with a delta of .7 or higher (probably a strike around $270).

Make sure you aren't too heavy into any single sector, and you have stocks like **MCD** and **AMAT** in your list as well.

What you want is to have several bullish plays ready to go across various sectors, and when you see **SPY** once again push upwards, you should be aggressively pulling the trigger on these trades.  *Again - not until you have confirmed that* ***SPY*** *has found support.*

Drops like these provide the best buying opportunities but so often people are either unprepared for them or jump in too early.  Last Thursday (9/16), I saw many traders assume that the drop was over given the previous pattern on **SPY** and as such they started executing a number of bullish swing trades, including Calls on **SPY**.  Needless to say, on Friday their accounts took a serious hit.  Why?  Because **SPY** did not confirm a reversal, just consolidation.

There are several areas of horizontal support/resistance for **SPY**,  downward sloping trendlines you can draw on the daily chart, and major SMA's to guide you - it should not be unclear to anyone when **SPY** reverses.  On Thursday, the market breached none of these lines - so there was no reason to get bullish on it.

Obviously these drops provide excellent Day Trading opportunities - on Friday for example, **ZM** began to go up around noon (est) as **SPY** continued to chop around, indicating Relative Strength to the market.  At 2pm (est), that strength is confirmed with **SPY** dropping and **ZM** holding its' bid.  That ticker provided several excellent *Day Trading* entries and exits throughout the day.  **UPST** and **ETSY** were similar.  In fact, days that **SPY** is bearish give you the best insight into stocks that are strong against the market and ready to really go once that get a tailwind behind them.

Many short-term traders shy away from price action like this on **SPY** and that would be a mistake.  *Day Trade* these drops with strong stocks, *Swing Trade* the reversal with high probability option plays.

\*Obviously you can and should *Day Trade* the reversal as well, but that is just a matter of looking for RS/RW as **SPY** is rebounding.

\*\*Also note that when I refer to Relative Strength I am not talking about RSI or Beta.  There are several posts on RS/RW in r/RealDayTrading and in my post history if you are curious.

TL;DR - These market drops provide the best *swing* and *day* trading opportunities, don't let them pass you by.",2021-09-19 14:51:59
614,One Question To Ask Yourself Before Making A Trade,"***""Can I Defend This Trade?""***

Seems like a very basic question, right?  If another trader asked you why you took the trade, can you defend your position?

If your defense is not based in any form of analysis, the answer is - no.

So many traders lose money consistently because they are constantly trying to anticipate a move before waiting for confirmation.  Guessing at bottoms and tops, attempting to 'stay ahead of the market', and wanting to capture a move from the very beginning are some of the top reasons why new traders wind up in the red.  Asking yourself this question before making a trade will help you filter out these *gut* decisions.

Let's say you bought calls on **ZM** at the close of market on Friday, and when asked why, your answer is, ""I think it has hit bottom, it has to start reversing soon"" - *that is not a defense.*

Or perhaps you bought puts on **CRM** at the close of market on Friday, with the defense of, ""It think it will pullback on Monday"" - *once again, that is not a defense.*

**Defensible trades are ones that you can offer clear analysis that support your decision.**

It doesn't mean your trade will work, but it does mean that you had understandable reasons for the making the play you did.

For example - on Friday I made the following trade, which I am still holding:

Put Debit Spread, expiring on 10/1 for **AMZN** where I bought the 3400 Puts and sold the 3350 Puts.  This costs me a debit of $16.25.

Here is my defense -

1. I am getting a 68% ROI on this trade, with $33.75 per contract of upside - meaning, if I am right more than 35% of the time, this trade is profitable.
2. **AMZN** has been weak to the market on a daily basis.  **SPY** has filled the gap from its' drop on 9/20, while **AMZN** has not.
3. **AMZN** is struggling to stay above its' SMA 50 right now, with low volume these past three days (compared to the high Relative Volume when it dropped).
4. My bias on the market is somewhat bearish - while **SPY** has filled the gap, selling pressure remains strong and it has not been able to rebound as previous patterns on the ETF suggested it might.
5. The rest of my portfolio is somewhat bullish, and given my slight bearish bias on the market, the **AMZN** trade acts as a strong hedge for me as well.
6. If **AMZN** manages to say above it's SMA 50 I still have some time close the trade for a loss, but not max loss.

Admittedly this is a riskier trade than what I usually do - but it is still *defensible.*

There are also many arguments *against* this trade as well - **AMZN** has shown a HA reversal on the daily chart, it closed above its' SMA 50, with an ATR of 60 it could move up significantly on Monday and thus leaving me with little chance to close the trade without taking a huge loss.  Just because there are arguments against a trade, does not mean it is not *defensible*.

Go through your trades in the past week/month and ask yourself, could I have defended this trade?  Be honest about it, and just mark the trades you could have defended with a Y and the ones you couldn't with a N.  Now look at the profit/loss for the trades marked with a Y vs. those with a N.  I absolutely guarantee that you performed significantly better on the trades you could defend.

While there are many different things one should do in order to be a successful trader, just asking yourself this question before making a trade will save you a significant amount of losing positions.  It is a very simple litmus test, and quick to apply.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit higher this morning after they recovered off their premarket lows. We are seeing volatility in premarket trading, and I'm guessing that will carry on into normal trading hours. At Thursday's close, the S&P was still up 15% year-to-date. Although we are now in 5% correction territory, I don't think we are in the clear yet. With uncertainty surrounding inflation and future fiscal policy, I'm not sure we'll see the strong bounce back that we usually see after these dips. We'll see what things look like closer to the open, but we could be in for some more choppiness. 

SPY was down close to the 426 level in early premarket trading, but is currently trading a bit under 431. If it's able to hold up over 430 support, we could see more strength today. If we breakdown below 430 support, we could see more selling off. DIA is trading just under 340. If it can get up and hold up over that support level, we could see more strength. If it fails to get over that resistance level this morning, it could retrace to the SMA(200) on the daily chart at around \~333.74. QQQ is trading a bit under 359. After tapping the SMA(100) in yesterday's trading, we could be in for a nice bounce today. I'll be watching 360 as a key resistance level. Gold is trading flat this morning, while silver is up. Crude oil is still pulling back, trading a bit over $74 per barrel. If it is able to hold up over the next few days, we could see another leg up in the near future. B\*\*coin is showing considerable strength after the past few days of consolidation, currently trading around 47,500. It could see some resistance around the 48,000 level, I'll be watching closely for the break over \~48,500. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are up in premarket trading, as a result. Chinese stocks are looking at a mixed open. Airlines and cruise stocks are showing strength this morning; we'll see if that strength holds up, or if we see selling pressure at these new resistance levels.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open this morning. We are hovering near ATH levels after we saw another strong day in the market yesterday. We could see some resistance up at this level, and it could make for some choppiness. If we continue to see strength, then it will be business as usual. Weekly jobless claims came in at their lowest level since March 2020 (pre-pandemic), and we continue to see strong earnings. Despite the supply chain concerns, it seems that companies are currently able to maintain their corporate margins by simply raising their prices. If supply chain concerns continue, then this process will only work for so long; eventually, the prices will be too high for consumers. Hence the inflation concerns. This is worth monitoring, as it could eventually halt growth in a serious way.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY back to all time highs in the pre - market! All week as we have had very nice intraday action. Yesterday we saw ranges expand once again. TSLA had a really nice move higher off of earnings, back to highs. DWAC ripped from 12.62 - 52 and is now 90.00 pre market.  IWM looks like its ready to start moving higher which is good for small and mid caps. The SPY is now up 7 days in a row. I will trade normal with no bias regarding price action, but I will be vigilant in case the whales decide to take profits. Business as usual for active day traders. It's Friday, try not to lose and ruin your weekend. Good luck trading, see you all Monday!

627,Peloton Puts update 6k —> 90k+,,2021-11-05 12:33:56
628,"Will there be some pain in $ARKK into year end? (I know, I know)","I will start this of by saying I like Cathie Wood and believe she gets way too much shit, hedgies and family office dipshit traders have been trying to increasingly fade her and she likely outperforms them all over the past 5 years, however I do believe there is a chance of some Archegos type pain happening in $ARKK into the end of the year.

This is lining up to be a perfect technical, fundamental and crazy Elon tweet storm of bearishness for $ARKK.

Looking at the chart $ARKK has not joined in the most recent 'everything rally'. It's not near new highs and is at some technical resistance.

&#x200B;

[$ARKK](https://preview.redd.it/ykb2dvvvm5y71.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dfd3e1988abaf87f7b1c0415e004b8be5232dcdc)

It's largest holding is $TSLA which has been on a screamer and to me looks blow off toppy. It's a great stock but it's extension, along with Elon's tweets over the weekend, as well as his options expiring soon IMO gives it at least a chance to pullback in the short term.

&#x200B;

[$TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/r3al0csxm5y71.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f44771139e8f7aa68ef455978ff36f4c50c0c1d)

Now comes the kicker, despite it's largest holding screaming higher $ARKK is still on a downwards trend. The rest of the underlying holdings look like dogshit.

I think the only holdings I sort of like is $COIN (long it) and $U. I believe we saw some liquidations in things like $Z and $PTON this week.

The question is if there is any sort of mean reversion on $TSLA would the selling $ARKK would be forced to do lead to further liquidations in some of it's shittier holdings and ultimately lead to some Bill Huang type shit?

I am taking a stab at this Monday as I think it's a good risk reward. I'll be using options (duh) to structure this trade:

**$ARKK Short Jan 120 Put + 2 x Long Jan 110 Put.**

I believe this a a good way to structure it. If I'm wrong and the teflon doesn't crack the trade is a small credit, if I'm right and it tanks then I obviously make some. Biggest loss would be if it trades sideways rest of the year, e.g maybe $COIN has some fucking blowout earnings and keeps it stable. I did think about changing the strike date to Feb to avoid a possible Santa Claus rally, but then again if I think my timing is right then Jan should be fine.",2021-11-07 06:03:43
629,$ZM PUTS is the next easy play,"I'm a bull at heart, but i'll turn into a gay bear if it means i'll get cashed out. 

$ZM has skyrocketed since the start of the pandemic since it's labeled as a pandemic play. What happened to $PTON is a foreshadowing of what's to come to the stock come Nov.22 on their earnings date. 

&#x200B;

You may be saying that $PTON and $ZM are in two different markets, which is true. BUT they are both a one trick pony that had a bull run due to the pandemic. 

&#x200B;

Next year major companies are having their employees return back to the office. Zoom meetings aren't going to be heavily used. Yes there are still people who are going to be working from home but it doesn't come close to justify Zoom's current share price. 

More vaccines are coming out that are fighting the covid BS. These pandemic plays are done. 

&#x200B;

Before the pandemic, Zoom was trading under $100. 

They may **MAY** beat earnings, but their future forecast doesn't appear to be promising. It will likely crush their stock price down to earth's core. 

**TL:DR,** **$ZM PUTS WILL PRINT AFTER THEIR EARNINGS 11/22**

** EDIT: OPTIONS I HOLD $250P 11/26 & $250P 12/03

Also, I should mention that they are lacking innovation on a competitive market. What do they have to offer that Microsoft's TEAMS , SLACK, and GOOGLE connect doesn't offer?",2021-11-11 12:09:22
630,$ZM Puts on the upcoming earning. Again.,"Good day peoples.

Before last earning and in few prior days to this I have seen $ZM pop op on my radar. Both times it came from no where with a thought ""Zoom is still a thing?"". So I did little DD on it. 

We all know that ZOOM is another virus baby and before that not a soul cared about their existence. For past months it have been down trading and being in the industry where meeting and calls are very common I am yet to see any large corporate use ZOOM. Teams have been a standard in engineering field where I work. Cut to the chase here is what statistics have to say. 

&#x200B;

1. According to ZOOM website traffic, it have picked up slightly after last yearnings, and now down trading again after a minor recovery. My bet it is due to College and High School students in some places still needing to use it and starting school in August. Now it is dropping again because of breaks and more in person schooling start being available across states. (My uni uses teams)

[Source 1 for ZOOM.us traffic. ](https://preview.redd.it/hnv4crt873z71.png?width=2227&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e496778e1872e28fa83ca24a81f3e61224e79476)

   2. This can also be see from a second source. 

&#x200B;

   3. Another aspect I looked at was the trending rank of the app in the app store. In the USA it is on down trend the most, followed by UK. 

[ZOOM app rank](https://preview.redd.it/l6n21ks383z71.png?width=2120&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed6b64b43bf11c597f7d8b320cdafc3c8315cd43)

4. Google statistic showed over all down trend. This chart was based on search, words, and news. As we can see it is been going down hill ever since we started going back to normal.  

[Google trends on ZOOM](https://preview.redd.it/y9z8qwti83z71.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ff7b2424c4fe859271f28817c86adc8461647cda)

5. Their website have also had a down turn of organic searches ever since June. 

&#x200B;

[Zoom website organic searches ](https://preview.redd.it/wv5a1kt493z71.png?width=2137&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=221a1ec7e00ca7b90b73db5134820b0d2f299f12)

&#x200B;

Zoom works with corporations and makes money of the contract with large corporate America. Many of those use Teams and have already opened their offices therefore people work in person. Their expectation of growing is just not there and Teams being a Microsoft product that will come with Office 365 subscription there is little for ZOOM to hold ground with. 

Base on data and the fact I am yet to see anyone use zoom, or even speak about it, I believe it will flow on next earnings and puts will print.

Position: $230 Puts that expire on 11/26 and $220 Puts expire on 12/03

632,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house. 

[The breadth of Rivian’s capabilities \(S1 Filing\)](https://preview.redd.it/gfkweeveqyz71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=84eb0027d264d47ef849411a70a31fada97c8d44)

 The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

>R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven—part truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers.

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology.

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders.

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

633,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house. 

[ The breadth of Rivian’s capabilities \(S1 Filing\) ](https://preview.redd.it/mllbiwmnryz71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1b428761a46a9cc69a4d7fd2efd99b9650ff622d)

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

>R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven—part truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)

But not all reviews have been positive:

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers.

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology.

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders).

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEFywyAMfE24xQMYg33g0Eu_wWCQHaYYXJDTcV9fkpwaDZIOrLTadRZhzeXUCBXJnisaPHfQCX5qBEQo5KhQTPCaeE0Vd2omoZqlAGw2RE32Y47BWQw5PVC9YlQyctNeqGkY-2WYlBTTOPGxH1yvrHec-cUNLzJ7-ADJgYY7lDMnIFHfEPd66T8u_LO9zZYvwAoJw9ZKV4-5onVfnctb-95bhj1fY07rtZ27kaA55ayFZJzRYep4J5kTamTCL0wIzmWH3zcc6S9cBN1W9m8nKfqdMob7A7k-BD8hTbNpfTtSwNNAsnMEr7EcQPDl5NMcs0KC0hz2xqJmsldUCikpk-qlvvklBGWCS0raDT63qfRO_wc8Qo7s), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

634,$MVES is the counterintuitive Metaverse play (A fat-fingered phenomenon!!),"  

We’ve all seen by now that Facebook is changing its name to Metaverse and the stock symbol will change from FB to MVRS on 12/1.

We could debate the merits of this brand change, but what is amazing to me is how poorly chosen the new stock symbol is. It is ripe for mistakes (I have seen completely serious commentary on twitter getting it wrong with mistakes like $MRVS and $META). 

There is a well documented phenomenon of these incorrect stock symbols skyrocketing.  Here’s a good example and a couple of charts that show how high these short term bursts can get

[https://news.camden.rutgers.edu/2019/08/investors-often-buy-the-wrong-stock-because-of-a-similar-name-or-ticker-symbol-says-new-research-at-rutgers-university-camden/](https://news.camden.rutgers.edu/2019/08/investors-often-buy-the-wrong-stock-because-of-a-similar-name-or-ticker-symbol-says-new-research-at-rutgers-university-camden/)

ZTNO got mixed up with ZM when Zoom went public and went from $0.01 to $5.00, down to $1.10 and then spiked to over $20.00!

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-ZTNO/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-ZTNO/)

TZPC went from $0.01 to over $30.00 in a few weeks

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-TZPC/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-TZPC/)

There is a long history of spikes in a stock price due to incorrect stock symbols and this is where we have a huge opportunity to get ahead of this change. The closest wrong stock symbol to MVRS that is an actual company is the penny stock MVES.

There is a very low float and if you are reading this, you’ve come across it before the wave of mistaken orders. In the age of algo trading and bots that are making purchases, all it takes is a handful of errant orders to come this way and blow through the asks to take this baby up 10x, 100x, or 10,000x . The stock has had very low trading volumes, so literally one fat-fingered trader and/or a misplaced decimal point could blow through all limit orders and send it to $10.00+

It's a great way to stick it to the bot traders that overwhelm the market and be in on the actual ground floor of one of these meteoric rises.

635,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

 It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house.  

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

**Products**  

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

>R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven—part truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)

But not all reviews have been positive:

>Even if the R1T does prove rugged and reliable, I have yet to see any evidence that the core of America’s truck-loving customers will be taken by its altruistic promise - [Bloomberg](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUcuOwyAM_JpyI8KEJemBw172NyIeboqaQBacRt2vX7K9LbL8QGN7NPaWcM7lZQgrsS1Xmui1oUl41AWJsLC9YpliMCwYMUg_OBbrdCuIq42LYdvulugtxZxOVD-A0MDuxiPAh3QgvbrBdeyD06rVOA4OeqH1e5ndQ8Tk0eATyysnZIu5E2310n9e5Fez4zg6t-S8Oixz5_Pa_k52LdhC0S94plJI4OLK5diKEp_RJl6AeMFnxIPjgp5K9DymGdMe6cXdTjzkxJvHDVPgLY_Eb7nwI5cHi-ac2Z4GCeLj2slOg1fDCCrcQCkpdUffdxrFD16UWGfo6u4qWf84WbJiVlseSBUTxbW5bonPEzmfuv1BmnRTi-ueGqEJk3ULBkNlR0bvg_xpPDXKWNqhwmTJgO4HoZXWAvTwFrHJrpQAJbVgjUPIrSv9X_8L24emwg)

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers. 

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology. 

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

It’s a fantastic piece and goes into much more depth about the product and company (a bit too bullish for me though).

\[3\] Well, the [valuation comparison of Rivian](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/) I made last week seems relatively outdated now given the insane rally.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* GTEC (+53%)
* UWMC (+20%)
* TUSK (+21%)
* GOEV (+3%)
* DPW (+14%)

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit lower this morning, after we saw a mixed day in the market yesterday. COVID lockdowns in Europe are spooking investors, and the reopening plays are getting hit as a result. The US has lower vaccination rates than many of the European countries, so it's a situation that is definitely worth following. Despite this, supply chain issues, and ongoing inflation concerns, the Nasdaq closed at a record high. Stay-at-home plays could be hot today, I'll be keeping an eye on ZM and PTON. We could be getting an announcement regarding President Biden's Federal Reserve chair nomination sometime today or this weekend, and while I don't think it will have an immediate effect on the market, it's worth staying in the loop. The main topic will be monetary policy and expectations going forward. 

SPY is trading a bit over 468. After some choppiness in yesterday's session, I'll be watching for more of the same today. If we see weakness, I'll be watching the SMA(9) as potential support at around \~467.28. DIA is trading just over 356. I'll be watching 356 and 354 as potential support levels, but we could see more weakness after dropping down below the SMA(9) in yesterday's trading. QQQ is trading a bit over 403. Tech stocks are holding up well compared to the overall market, but I still think we have some choppiness ahead. Gold is up a bit this morning, while silver is down. Crude oil broke down below the $80 level and is seeing more weakness this morning. We could see a retrace back towards the $70 level in the near future. Bitcoin is currently trading around 57,500. After pulling back a bit over the past few days, I'll be watching the 59,000-60,000 level as potential resistance now. Relevant support down around 54,000-55,000. Crypto-related stocks are a bit mixed at the moment after the recent weakness in crypto. Airlines and cruise stocks are down in premarket and could see continued weakness. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",2021-11-19 08:46:12
637,"ZM Earnings: ZM will plummet, but by how much?","ZM reports earnings on Monday. 

I’ve got 10k on 12/17 200p, 60 contracts. Will most probably add more eod. 

My discussion topic: As things return to normal and as major competitors such as Cisco’s WebEx, Google’s Meet, and Microsoft’s Teams encroach on zoom, it’s not looking good. 

But the stock is down from the lofty $400s already. Obviously I think it could fall further. I think they are the next Skype: video conferencing is only valuable when packaged with other business services. It’s also just as easy to use FaceTime or Google Meet. I don’t see zoom having any moat or innovation that can’t be copied. 

Counter argument to this is sectors that don’t use tech stacks heavily have adopted zoom. I’m thinking Law, Academia, other light business etc. Also there is some stickiness in the space, particularly for older generations. 

Currently the stock trades at a PE multiple of 76. That’s a tech company valuation which is universally predicated on continued growth and growth potential. 

I’m skeptical their forward guidance will indicate future growth. So a better multiple might be more along the lines of 30-50, which represents a drop of 50% to 33%.  

Thoughts?

Edit after ER:

the initial reaction looks positive. It might turn around based on guidance. Let’s see what the guidance is.

Second edit:

Yea bitches that’s how we do!

Third Edit:

ZM never dies, but hopefully by tomorrow it will have sunk some more.  IV crush will be a bitch but December options will hopefully be ok. 

Final verdict: ZM did not plummet much after earnings. 

GL to all thanks for keeping the discussion lively.",2021-11-19 13:14:32
638,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021.

# **Stocks may be entering an optimal period in the Thanksgiving holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/stocks-may-be-entering-an-optimal-period-in-the-thanksgiving-holiday-week.html)**
*****
> If history is a guide, the market should do well in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday week.
*****
> The S&P 500 was slightly higher in the past week, buoyed by positive economic reports, particularly the unexpectedly strong 1.7% jump in October’s retail sales. There are a number of economic reports in the week ahead. The most important release is Wednesday’s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the inflation measure most watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> “The last five trading days of November are traditionally positive, since 1950,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “There’s a two-thirds likelihood the market is up on the day before Thanksgiving and a 57% likelihood the day after Thanksgiving, and a 71% likelihood that it’s up on Monday.”
*****
> This year that holiday rally could depend on whether Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues in his role after his term expires in February. Biden has also interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is supported by progressive Democrats.
*****
> Strategists expect market volatility around the appointment, particularly if it is Brainard. She is viewed as more dovish than Powell, meaning she may be slower to raise interest rates. Elevated levels of inflation have been a concern in the market, and the worry is Brainard would not be as aggressive fighting it with rate hikes if necessary.
*****
> “Barring a change at the helm of the Fed, I think the market trajectory is going to continue to be higher, as we move toward 2022,” said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist with ClearBridge Investments. “Given that Brainard is even more dovish than Powell, I think markets would recover very quickly... the markets are unsure whether the new Fed chairman could command consensus within the FOMC to effectively deliver policy,” he added.
*****
> Schulze said the economic momentum is improving, and he expects that fourth-quarter gross domestic product could be in the double digits after the disappointing 2% pace of the third quarter. The second reading for the third-quarter GDP is released Wednesday.
*****
> In the past week, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index also showed solid, better-than-expected activity in the mid-Atlantic region. “It really confirms the view that despite supply side constraints, the recovery is on track after the Covid-related slowdown in Q3,” Schulze said. “I think the markets are going to price in better earnings as we move into fourth-quarter earnings and 2022.”
*****
> But Stovall said the market may take a pause before it moves higher, and he expects a choppy period. The S&P 500 gains on average 7.2% between its October low and the end of the year. But by early November, the S&P 500 was up more than 9% from its low, and was overbought, he said.
*****
> Stovall also said the market could become concerned again about the spread of Covid in Europe and beyond. Due to a high rate of new cases, the government of Austria announced a three-week lockdown and a vaccine mandate.
*****
> Stocks reacted negatively to the Austrian news Friday, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained. Stocks were mixed for the week, with the Dow down 1.4% and the Nasdaq up 1.2%, lifted by tech stock gains. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% for the week, ending at 4,697.
*****
> “There is still upside potential. The worry about inflation and now Covid are reasons for the overbought condition to work itself through,” he said. Stovall added the market could move sideways to lower for awhile, but it should end the year higher. “But right now, there’s a bit of choppiness because of Covid, because of the Fed chair possibly being replaced the worry about inflation and now and a whole variety of things,” he said.
*****
> For investors who watch the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, Wells Fargo bond strategists point out that long-term Treasury yields generally move lower on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.
*****
> “Our take is straightforward, and is essentially the same rationale as for moves around Labor Day: risk appetite is low on both the buy and sell sides,” they said. But later in the week, starting Wednesday, the yield tends to rise.

> # Tech is Leading Again

> The S&P 500 Information Technology Sector has gained 27% in the past six months, outperforming the broader S&P 500 by more than 10%. But could its run of leadership just be getting started? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the sector just broke out to fresh relative highs for the first time since September 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

> 14 months without a new relative high may not sound like a lot, but that actually represented the longest streak of underperformance for the tech sector since a more than 3-year run that ended in 2015. And while the sector’s breakout does not mean that it will automatically go on another run of multiyear outperformance, we do believe context is important and that investors should recognize that just because technology has had a strong run recently, over the past 14 months the sector has performed just in line with the broader market. We would also note that these are not all-time relative highs for the sector, as it still sits below its early-2000 peak.

> “The theme of 2021 has been rotation, rotation, rotation,” said LPL Financial Technical Strategist Scott Brown. “But technology is the only sector to recently hit a 52-week relative high and we believe that sets up a favorable outlook heading into 2022.”

> From a fundamental perspective, technology continues to be a key enabler of higher productivity and home to many of the fastest growing companies. Despite topping all sectors with 9% earnings growth in 2020, earnings growth this year is on track to exceed 30%.

> So does this mean investors should be shifting all of their assets over to growth stocks again? We don’t necessarily think so, and continue to find opportunities in both growth and value styles. In our proprietary sector trend rankings, technology comes in at #2, trailing only energy and just ahead of financials, both of which sit firmly in the value style and have benefitted from the continued reopening and above trend economic growth. We believe quality growth and more cyclical value companies can both do well in the current environment and remain most negative on defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities that have traditionally underperformed during early-to-middle stages of the business cycle.

> # Sentiment Back to Average

> The past week has seen the S&P 500 hover right below but not at record highs. The lack of new highs in price appears to have left individual investors apprehensive as bullish sentiment in the AAII survey pulled back 9.2 percentage points to 38.8%. That was the biggest one-week drop since a 16.5 percentage point decline in the week of September 16th, though back then, bullish sentiment sat much lower at 22.4%. At the current level, bullish sentiment is still within one percentage point of the historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bull.png))**



> While bullish sentiment saw a sharp reversal lower, bearish sentiment rose modestly to 27.2%. That is the highest level since the end of October and that remains roughly 3 percentage points below the historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Those inverse moves resulted in the bull-bear spread falling to 11.6. While lower, that still indicates overall sentiment favors optimists.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Spread.png))**

> A greater share of the losses to bullish sentiment shifted to the neutral camp with around a third of respondents reporting as such. That is the highest level since the first week of October. That reading is a few percentage points above the historical average meaning that like bullish and bearish sentiment, current survey readings do not indicate sentiment is elevated or depressed to any sort of notable extent.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Neutral.png))**

*****

> # 2021 Now Has The Second Most New Highs Ever

> The incredible bull run of 2021 continues, with the S&P 500 Index only 0.02% away from the 66th all-time high this calendar year, tied with (for now) the 65 set in 1964 and behind only the record 77 set in 1995. “We’ve run out of superlatives to describe what we’ve seen so far this year, so we’ll keep it very simple. Years like this don’t happen very often, so let’s remember to enjoy it,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 66 new highs this year would be second only to 1995. With about six weeks to go this year, 2021 is on pace to just barely miss setting a new record of new highs, but they say you won’t hit the pitches you don’t swing at and 2021 still has a lot of swings left, so anything is possible.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart1.png?ssl=1))**

> As we noted at the start of the month, November has been the best month of the year for stocks and it has been quite strong yet again this year. But be aware that November is historically rather strong early and late, while the middle can be choppy. Suggesting new highs could be a little tough to come by in the near-term, at least until we all get our fill of Turkey next week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Additionally, post-election years can get quite choppy from now until late in December. After the run we’ve had lately, maybe some sideways chop is necessary, but we see further gains ahead through year-end.

> # Small and Mid Caps Gain Ground

> Equities broadly have been in rally mode so far this quarter, but in the month of November smaller market caps have generally outperformed. Month to date, the small-cap S&P 600 ETF (IJR) has gained 5.88% as of this morning while the mid-cap S&P 400 ETF (IJH) has risen 4.21%. Large caps as proxied by the S&P 500 (SPY), meanwhile, are up less than 2% MTD. While there is plenty of time left in the month for things to change, the spread between the month-to-date performance of small and mid-caps versus large caps is on pace to be on the wider side of all months of the past twenty years. As shown in the charts below, IJR is currently outperforming SPY MTD by 4.05 percentage points, and that reading is 2.37 percentage points for IJH versus SPY. Those rank in the 91st and 86th percentiles, respectively, of all months of the past twenty years. That also marks the first month with significant outperformance of smaller market caps relative to large caps since the stretch of large-cap underperformance that ran from the fall of last year through this past February. Prior to that, you would have to go back to March 2018 to find the last time that small and mid-caps both outperformed large caps by as much as they are this month.

&nbsp;

Hey bull gang, hope you’re all doing well! Earnings week is slowly winding down, meaning we’ve got less opportunities to make plays. I believe this will be the last week of the historical post earnings move spreadsheet for the quarter, as next week barely has any companies reporting. I would like to thank you all for checking in with me all throughout the quarter and giving your opinions on my plays! I hope you all managed to make some good money by tagging along. I’ll see you all in two months! Let’s get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1memzXUXLqNBD0jy43ImdIiF5joZ7M9NSY6d8ZiCYXIc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1memzXUXLqNBD0jy43ImdIiF5joZ7M9NSY6d8ZiCYXIc/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **$DLTR and $DG provide us with a collateral play opportunity.** $DLTR reports earnings this week, while $DG is set to report next. If I’m bullish or bearish on either company, I should look to enter a $DG position BEFORE $DLTR reports since the $DLTR report will move $DG a comparable amount. By playing $DG we can avoid IV crush but still cash in on our gains if we’re correct. More info on this type of play can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **$PDD is inefficiently priced.** You guys already know the drill. At the time of writing, $PDD is priced to move around 10%. Historically $PDD moves 14%. Similar to $FL last week, $PDD reports on Friday, meaning that theta will murder the value of the options, allowing us to get in cheaper than we would normally be able to. Given that volatility doesn’t inflate, the options will be pricing a move closer to 8% come Friday, meaning we’ve got huge edge in this trade. If the numbers are still appealing come Wednesday afternoon (markets are closed Thursday), I will run a long straddle. More information on this type of play can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

644,"Zoom's ""Hybrid World of Work""","Shares of Zoom Communications (Nasdaq: ZM) dropped 6.8% in after-hours trading on Monday following the release of quarterly earnings results from the video platform.

Financials: Zoom reported a $1.11 earnings per share and revenue of $1.05 billion, both were better than expectations. Future guidance was also slightly better as well.

Deeper Dive: While third-quarter revenue is up 35% year-over-year, it is below the growth that the company reported during the same period last year.

Bigger Picture: Zoom is preparing for a potential post-pandemic world. The company has rolled out new tools for hybrid workforces, but there is also a lot of competition from other tech businesses.

Quote: “We are well on our way to becoming an indispensable platform for enterprises, individuals, and developers to connect, collaborate, and build in the flexible hybrid world of work.” - Zoom founder and CEO, Eric S. Yuan.

Final Thoughts: Is there a future after the pandemic for Zoom?

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower this morning, doing their best to keep with the spirit of Black Friday. Lots of stocks showing weakness, it could get choppy in today's trading. There should be some nice volatility though, which is good for trading. COVID fears are spooking the market, hitting the travel stocks hard in particular. As a result, we are also seeing some strength from stay-at-home plays, as well as some biotech/healthcare stocks. COVID fears could last a few weeks more, given we are now seeing reports of a new variant in South Africa. I'm guessing we'll see some more choppiness leading into next week. 

SPY is trading a bit under 462. Gapping down below both the SMA(9) and SMA(20), we are in for some volatility today. Relevant support levels at 460 and 455, with relevant resistance at 465. If we break down below support levels, we could retrace to the more significant support level around 445. DIA is trading a bit over 350. Currently gapping down beneath both the SMA(50) and SMA (100), I'll be watching the 352 level as potential resistance this morning. QQQ is trading just under 395. Currently hovering around the SMA(20) at \~394.80, I'll be watching price action around that level. If we see weakness, we could retrace towards 390 support. Gold and silver are up this morning. Crude oil is down, seeing considerable weakness with COVID/lockdown fears. Bitcoin is seeing some weakness this morning, currently trading around 54,200. Hovering around support levels from earlier this year, I'll be watching price action closely today. If we see more weakness, we could retrace below the 50k level. Crypto-related stocks are getting hit hard in premarket trading, as a result. Airlines and cruise stocks are seeing considerable weakness this morning, with ongoing COVID fears. Banks are also seeing considerable weakness this morning, worth monitoring today and into next week. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",2021-11-26 08:17:08

# [Dow futures rebound by 200 points after Friday’s big sell-off as investors reassess omicron risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures pointed to a rebound following Friday’s big sell-off, as investors monitor the latest developments related to the Covid omicron variant and assess its potential market impact.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 210 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures added 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose about 0.9%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a holiday-shortened session Friday in which the Dow posted its worst day since October 2020. The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5%. The S&P 500 tumbled 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.2%. The three major indexes were negative for the week.
*****
> The World Health Organization on Friday labeled the omicron strain a “variant of concern.” While scientists continue to research the variant, omicron’s large number of mutations has raised alarm. Preliminary evidence suggests the strain has an increased risk of reinfection, according to the WHO. The variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa and has been found in the U.K., Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Australia and Hong Kong, but not yet in the U.S. Many countries, including the U.S., moved to restrict travel from southern Africa.
*****
> The South African doctor who first raised the alarm over the new variant told the BBC that patients had “extremely mild” symptoms though it was too early to determine how omicron behaves before it is studied closely.
*****
> “While it is too early to have definitive data, early reported data suggest that the Omicron virus causes ‘mild to moderate’ symptoms (less severity) and is more transmissible,” Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management tweeted Sunday evening. “If this turns out to be true, this is bullish not bearish for markets.”
*****
> Stocks that were the hardest hit on Friday were rebounding the most on Monday.
*****
> Travel related stocks were up across the board. Carnival and Norwegian cruise lines were up more than 4% apiece in premarket trading. American, Delta and United airlines were up more than 2% each. Booking Holdings was up 2%. Boeing was up 1.7%.
*****
> “We would be aggressive buyers of this pullback,” wrote Fundstrat’s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday night. “As with the case for Beta and Delta variants, the ‘bark’ has proven worse than the bite in each of those precedent instances. The market carnage, in our view, will be short-lived and transitory.”
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded back above 1.5% after a flight to safety Friday sent investors scrambling into bonds and rates lower (Prices move inversely to yields). Bank of America, American Express and other financials gained on the rebound in yields.
*****
> One stock that continued its Friday trend was Moderna. The vaccine maker’s stock was up another 10% in premarket trading after jumping 20% on Friday.
*****
> Vaccine makers have announced measures to investigate omicron with testing already underway. While it remains to be seen how omicron responds to current vaccines or whether new formulations are required, Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said Sunday the vaccine maker could roll out a reformulated vaccine against the omicron variant early next year.
*****
> Wall Street’s fear gauge — the CBOE volatility index — was retreating again Monday after a 10-point spike on Friday. UBS looked at the last 17 times since 1990 when the VIX surged 10 points in a single day and found markets tended to snap back in the subsequent trading days. The S&P 500 was higher by 2.5%, on average, the next trading day and 1.6% higher, on average, over the next week, UBS found.
*****
> On top of Covid developments, investors are also anticipating key economic data released this week.
*****
> The November jobs report on Friday is expected to show solid jobs growth. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect 581,000 jobs added in November. The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday and economists also expect strong results.
*****
> “The pandemic and COVID variants remain one of the biggest risks to markets, and are likely to continue to inject volatility over the next year(s). It’s hard to say at this point how lasting or impactful this latest variant will be for markets,” Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said in a note Friday.

# [Dow futures rebound by 200 points after Friday’s big sell-off as investors reassess omicron risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures pointed to a rebound following Friday’s big sell-off, as investors monitor the latest developments related to the Covid omicron variant and assess its potential market impact.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 210 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures added 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose about 0.9%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a holiday-shortened session Friday in which the Dow posted its worst day since October 2020. The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5%. The S&P 500 tumbled 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.2%. The three major indexes were negative for the week.
*****
> The World Health Organization on Friday labeled the omicron strain a “variant of concern.” While scientists continue to research the variant, omicron’s large number of mutations has raised alarm. Preliminary evidence suggests the strain has an increased risk of reinfection, according to the WHO. The variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa and has been found in the U.K., Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Australia and Hong Kong, but not yet in the U.S. Many countries, including the U.S., moved to restrict travel from southern Africa.
*****
> The South African doctor who first raised the alarm over the new variant told the BBC that patients had “extremely mild” symptoms though it was too early to determine how omicron behaves before it is studied closely.
*****
> “While it is too early to have definitive data, early reported data suggest that the Omicron virus causes ‘mild to moderate’ symptoms (less severity) and is more transmissible,” Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management tweeted Sunday evening. “If this turns out to be true, this is bullish not bearish for markets.”
*****
> Stocks that were the hardest hit on Friday were rebounding the most on Monday.
*****
> Travel related stocks were up across the board. Carnival and Norwegian cruise lines were up more than 4% apiece in premarket trading. American, Delta and United airlines were up more than 2% each. Booking Holdings was up 2%. Boeing was up 1.7%.
*****
> “We would be aggressive buyers of this pullback,” wrote Fundstrat’s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday night. “As with the case for Beta and Delta variants, the ‘bark’ has proven worse than the bite in each of those precedent instances. The market carnage, in our view, will be short-lived and transitory.”
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded back above 1.5% after a flight to safety Friday sent investors scrambling into bonds and rates lower (Prices move inversely to yields). Bank of America, American Express and other financials gained on the rebound in yields.
*****
> One stock that continued its Friday trend was Moderna. The vaccine maker’s stock was up another 10% in premarket trading after jumping 20% on Friday.
*****
> Vaccine makers have announced measures to investigate omicron with testing already underway. While it remains to be seen how omicron responds to current vaccines or whether new formulations are required, Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said Sunday the vaccine maker could roll out a reformulated vaccine against the omicron variant early next year.
*****
> Wall Street’s fear gauge — the CBOE volatility index — was retreating again Monday after a 10-point spike on Friday. UBS looked at the last 17 times since 1990 when the VIX surged 10 points in a single day and found markets tended to snap back in the subsequent trading days. The S&P 500 was higher by 2.5%, on average, the next trading day and 1.6% higher, on average, over the next week, UBS found.
*****
> On top of Covid developments, investors are also anticipating key economic data released this week.
*****
> The November jobs report on Friday is expected to show solid jobs growth. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect 581,000 jobs added in November. The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday and economists also expect strong results.
*****
> “The pandemic and COVID variants remain one of the biggest risks to markets, and are likely to continue to inject volatility over the next year(s). It’s hard to say at this point how lasting or impactful this latest variant will be for markets,” Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said in a note Friday.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher this morning after we had a choppy session on Black Friday. There is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the new omicron variant discovered in South Africa, so there could still be more choppiness ahead of us. Multiple countries have already issued travel bans from several African countries, and it's worth following the situation for any other developments, as lockdowns could hurt the market in the near-term. 

SPY is trading a bit under 463, and I'll be watching that level as resistance this morning. DIA is trading a bit over 351. Currently hovering around the SMA(100) at \~351.64, I'll be watching that level, and around \~353 as potential resistance. If we see weakness, I'll be watching 350 as potential support. QQQ is trading just under 395, and I'll be watching that level as resistance/support this morning. Gold and silver are up a bit this morning. Crude oil is up this morning, recovering a bit from the sell-off that we saw on Friday. Bitcoin is currently trading around 57,100, after some choppiness over the weekend. I'll be watching whether or not we can find support above the 57,000 level. Ethereum has been showing strength relative to Bitcoin, worth following over the next week or so. Crypto-related stocks are up in premarket trading. Airlines and cruise stocks were hit hard on Friday, and are looking at a bounce this morning. Still trading below previous support levels, I'll be watching those levels as potential resistance now. Banks were down on Friday, but seem to be recovering nicely. Worth following to see if they are able to get up to the previous levels, or if this is just a bounce with more weakness in store.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",2021-11-29 08:44:41

# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.
*****
> Dow futures rose 305 points. S&P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.
*****
> The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.
*****
> Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.
*****
> Merck led gainers on the S&P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.
*****
> Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.
*****
> Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.
*****
> The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.
*****
> “Our sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed’s] Dec. 15 meeting,” Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.
*****
> “At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,” Powell said. “I expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.”
*****
> Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.
*****
> The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.
*****
> Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.
*****
> Expediting the removal of the Fed’s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.
*****
> “Markets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
*****
> The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.
*****
> Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.
*****
> Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.
*****
> ADP’s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000
*****
> On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November’s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October’s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.

662,"TDOC holder, trying to calm myself...","**Trying to wrap my mind around this: About a year ago, TDOC finalized the buying of Livongo for 18.3B. Now TDOC is worth around 15B.**

I was ""forced"" into TDOC because of that, as my shares were transferred to TDOC. Was around 150% up in LVGO, but missed the merger date so was not able to sell my LVGO shares on time. TDOC then picked up a bit of momentum in early 2021, reaching an ATH of 308 in February. Now trading around 92/93, that is a 70% decline in 8 months! I kept on buying the ""dips"" since February, now holding 455 shares at 149$, -35% down (-22.5K$)

Amazing how things could change that much within a year! This is even wild in the K\*R\*Y\*P\*T\*O market.....

And the sad thing is, even if there comes a stellar q4 ER report, the stock may go up 10% or so, no more..... but to break even, I need 53% runup... Also strange that the stock is plunging even on those days the covid variant FUD is lifting some covid play stocks like ZM and PLTON. The recent sell off of some growth stock (E.g. NET, SE, ) could be attributed to profit taking as they have rallied pretty hard this year, which is the opposite of TDOC...

I read a recent article from Seeking A\* entitled ""Teladoc: Understanding The Difference Between A Broken Company And A Broken Stock"", that comforted me a bit, sharing the highlights here below:

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

**T*****eladoc shareholders had a rough couple of months as shares declined by more than 40% YTD and are down roughly 60% from all-time highs in February.***

***Telehealth has seen rapid uptake during the pandemic and utilization rates continue to be more than 30-times higher than pre-pandemic.***

***McKinsey estimated that telehealth could become a >$250bn annual market opportunity in the US alone.***

***Teladoc has pioneered the telehealth industry and has shown strong operating performance while many competitors are failing to keep up.***

***The big question is if the stock can shake off the negative sentiment as a Covid stock and reverse its downtrend. We believe it can.***

***In our view, investors are currently factoring in too much negativity with Teladoc. We believe that the company's future will be driven by the inevitable adoption of virtual care delivery which will help to eliminate major healthcare resource constraints, especially for physician visits and chronic disease management. Remember that the Telehealth market in the US alone is estimated to be a quarter-trillion dollar opportunity at some point. With the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care, near-virtual office visits, virtual home health services, as well as tech-enabled home medication administration, Teladoc seems perfectly positioned to capture a significant share of this market as it continues to build out its multitude of services. We believe Teladoc should be able to address up to 80% of the market opportunity with its services.***

\--------------------------------------------

Article (without figures)

It is important to highlight that the telehealth market is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality perception, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. The global telehealth market was valued at 62.5 billion USD in 2020 and forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026. North America remains by far the largest market as the US market revenue crossed USD 36.6bn in 2020. The US market is expected to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of >$150 billion by 2026.

There is no doubt that Teladoc will likely continue to grow its business at a significant pace, albeit at slower rates than during the heights of the pandemic. In our view the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable. At the same time, management's forecast for >$4bn in revenue by 2024 means the company will at least double its current revenues within 3 years which is a strong sign of confidence. We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is a big difference between a broken company and a broken stock and being able to make returns in a selloff requires understanding the difference between the two. When the market or a particular sector suffers huge losses, investors have an opportunity to buy good companies that have taken an unfair beating at attractive prices. We believe Teladoc (TDOC) provides such an opportunity given its leadership position in a secular growth industry. When speaking about telehealth, the first company that actually comes to mind is Teladoc as it has pioneered the rise of the telehealth market to a large extent, which was further accelerated by the pandemic.

&#x200B;

Teladoc shares entered 2020 just above $80 per share. The share price shot higher amidst increased demand for virtual healthcare delivery as the pandemic hit the world. Shares reached an all-time high in the beginning of 2021 around $300. Since the end of February, shares are in a continuous downtrend and are down more than 40% YTD and around 60% since its all-time highs in February, compared to a 25% YTD gain for the S&P 500.

&#x200B;

And while the company continued to report strong growth rates, investors seem concerned about the sustainability of the company's growth and path to profitability. Teladoc posted another set of strong topline growth rates in its most recent quarter, while also boosting its full-year revenue guidance. Management also provided a longer-term outlook until 2024 at its most recent investor day calling for >$4bn in revenue, representing a CAGR between 25 to 30%.

&#x200B;

But that seemingly isn't enough to please investors and reverse the downtrend. While the outlook anticipates strong sustained growth, the growth rate is far lower compared to last year. In our view, the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable in light of the re-opening of economies across the globe. Nevertheless, Teladoc's 2024 forecast means the company will continue its strong path of growth (albeit at slower rates) and will at least double its current revenues within 3 years.

&#x200B;

We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors that may want to participate in this secular growth industry.

&#x200B;

This article will look at Teladoc's most recent financial performance, outlook and will put things into context of the current state of telehealth globally. Let's start with the latter.

&#x200B;

The Current State of Telehealth

Telehealth is seeing a historically high consumer demand that keeps to be significantly higher than pre-Covid-pandemic levels. While telehealth was rather perceived as a commodity, the pandemic has shown that it became an essential part of our everyday lives. It has become a necessity, an important bridge to allow patients to continue to receive necessary care. Telehealth has enabled to eliminate major healthcare system constraints, e.g., hospital beds and physician visiting hours that were needed for taking care of Covid patients while capacities for regular in-patient visits in chronic or mental care were almost completely eliminated.

&#x200B;

On the basis of a recent study by McKinsey, Teladoc estimates that the opportunity for telehealth adoption in the US alone could represent up to $261 billion.

&#x200B;

It is important to highlight that this opportunity still needs to be fully realized as the industry is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. In 2020 the global telehealth market was valued at $62.45 billion and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026, and North America crossed $36.6 billion in annual spend. Analysts are expecting the US market to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of >$150 billion by 2026.

&#x200B;

With this huge opportunity in mind, where do we stand today?

Overall, there are 3 key enablers that determine the future market growth: 1) consumer demand and acceptance, 2) provider willingness and ability to offer telehealth on a more regular basis, and 3) regulatory changes supporting necessary access and reimbursement.

&#x200B;

In terms of consumer demand, a McKinsey report showed that, in April 2020, right after the COVID pandemic hit the world, telehealth utilization was 78 times higher than in February 2020.

&#x200B;

Now that the pandemic is having less of an impact as vaccines have become widely available, and lockdown restrictions are being lifted, telehealth use is still at significantly higher levels than pre-pandemic. Telehealth utilization has now stabilized at levels 38X higher vs. pre-pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, more than 32% of office and outpatient visits were occurring via telehealth in April 2020. Now utilization levels have largely stabilized with up to 17% of all outpatient/office-based visits being delivered virtually or virtually-enabled.

&#x200B;

Despite the relatively higher overall utilization rates compared to pre-pandemic levels, there is still a high level of variation with respect to the point of care and specialties where telehealth is being provided, with mental health services and endocrinology being in the top 3 of service modalities as of February 2021. Similarly, perception of telehealth usage has continuously improved. Around half of the consumers intend to continue to use telehealth going forward, up from 11% prior to COVID-19. This is in line with what Teladoc reported during its most recent Investor Day Presentation.

&#x200B;

However, there is still some concern, especially on the consumer side on the quality, safety and accessibility of the technology, the latter being especially true for elderly people. Telehealth care delivery models are likely to adapt to such barriers by means of extending their platform offerings from fully virtual care delivery to offering also hybrid virtual and technology enabled in-person care delivery to really break down such barriers.

&#x200B;

On the provider side, McKinsey suggests that more than half (58%) of doctors view telehealth more favorably now than they did before the COVID pandemic. Looking at actual utilization, 84% of doctors are now offering virtual visits. It has become clear, however, that costs of care delivery and reimbursement regulations are important aspects to consider moving forward.

&#x200B;

Also, from a regulatory standpoint, things have progressed in favor of making telehealth a permanent care delivery option, enabling access and reimbursement for a range of telehealth services. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have expanded coverage on reimbursable telehealth services in the 2021 physician fee schedule final rule.

&#x200B;

Investments in virtual healthcare have skyrocketed lately, with 3 times the level of venture investment in 2020 vs. 2017. Per Rock Health's H1 2021 digital health funding report 10 the total venture capital investment into the digital health space in the first half of 2021 totaled $14.6 billion, nearly twice the investment from 2019 ($7.7 billion).

*Is Telehealth here to stay?*

As we continue to move out of the pandemic into a more normalized healthcare delivery environment, there is no doubt that telehealth will remain an important component of healthcare delivery, supported by improved customer and provider perceptions, regulatory improvements, and a broadening of access to and coverage of services. Further broad-based adoption will require that providers and regulators work closely together to address some of the still imminent barriers, especially integrating virtually enabled services into the day-to-day routine of clinicians to enable hybrid care models.

One last point to note is that telehealth still remains a highly fragmented industry. This creates two important necessities: first, there is a clear need for a better and more holistic value proposition by means of a whole-person care approach where services from multiple disciplines are integrated to provide the best customer experience. From an industry perspective, this means that consolidation is inevitable to achieve this necessary level of integration.

This brings us to the most important conclusion: telehealth will likely be a winner takes most industry and only a few relevant players will be able to scale their services and will take most of the market opportunity. McKinsey estimated that up to $250 billion in annual healthcare spend could be up for grab, with the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care ($35bn), near-virtual office visits ($39 bn), and virtual home health services ($35 bn), as well as an additional $12bn in tech-enabled home medication administration.

What does it mean for Teladoc?

With the above in mind, it becomes obvious that Teladoc has positioned itself as the leader to capture the significant market opportunity in virtual care delivery as its services address almost every area of virtual care delivery.

&#x200B;

Also in terms of its provider network, Teladoc is already operating at a significant scale with its network of more than 10 thousand care providers and more than 76 Mio members as of Q3 2021. And management sees a long runway of member growth ahead with currently 92 Mio people (\~31% of insured lives in the U.S.) having access to a Teladoc product, and \~63 Mio additional potential customers to grab from existing clients, managed care organizations and Medicare & Medicaid Fee-for-Service lives.

&#x200B;

Management also believes that the opportunity across the 92 Mio individuals who currently have access to one of its services constitutes at least a $75bn annual revenue opportunity, with significant upside to $137bn if customers would opt for multi-product adoption across Teladoc's services portfolio.

&#x200B;

Below is an illustration on how multi-product adoption by an employer with 10,000 customers may lead to 4.1x higher revenues vs. a single condition product adoption. This is an important aspect to keep in mind as medical conditions do not occur in isolation, and for example, 40% of Americans live with two or more chronic conditions (like diabetes and hypertension) in parallel and would benefit from an integrated care delivery approach. Teladoc's solutions can offer exactly what is needed and can reinforce each other to drive broader engagement across the platform.

&#x200B;

And Teladoc is in a leading position to make whole-person virtual care delivery a reality, especially through its Primary360 platform, which functions as the gateway to enabling fully integrated whole-person care delivery. Management estimates that around 80% of the US population could benefit from one of its primary care services under the Primary360 platform, with the total addressable market for managing Diabetes and Hypertension alone representing a $47bn opportunity.

&#x200B;

Its ability to penetrate the increasing customer need for virtual care delivery solutions is also reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. For Q3 2021, Teladoc reported:

Revenue growth of 81% YoY to $522 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $67.4 million, growing by 71% YoY.

Revenue growth was driven by +99% YoY growth in access fees revenue and +18% YoY growth in visit fee revenue. Growth in the US came in at 89% vs. 17% growth for international geographies. The difference between US and international is partly historical but was also impacted by the acquisition of Livongo, which is only available to US customers at the moment.

Total visits for the quarter reached 3.9M at a 37% YoY growth rate, showing an acceleration from around 28% growth in the previous quarter, and driven by a 40% increase in US visits vs. 19% growth for international visits.

U.S. Paid Members gained \~2% YoY in Q3, which is a deceleration from the prior-year growth. However, it is good to see that Paid Members and PMPM (per member per month) fees are continuing to trend upwards in parallel as both are two important metrics that together will drive topline growth moving forward.

Most importantly the percentage of chronic care members enrolled in more than one program has grown 3x year-over-year to 24% in the most recent quarter, while more than 40% of telehealth members have access to multiple products compared to less than 10% in 2017.

Looking at profitability, net loss for Q3 more than doubled from the prior-year quarter to reach $84.3M. The lack of profitability is one of the most frequently raised concerns by investors and deserves a look under the surface. Net loss for Q3 was mainly driven by stock-based compensation (SBC), mostly in relation to the recent Livongo acquisition. Teladoc actually reported positive adjusted EBITDA when excluding SBC (which accounted for 85% of the quarter's net loss) and some other smaller items.

The impact from SBC on profitability is expected to decrease over the coming quarters, and when it does we expect Teladoc to make significant steps towards GAAP profitability.

Irrespective of this Teladoc is already showing its cash-generating potential as the company posted a positive operating cash flow of $111 million over the past 9 months, which increased the overall cash position to $823.8M.

Goss margins remained in line with previous quarters, but adjusted EBITDA margins showed a slight decrease in Q3 vs. prior quarters.

Teladoc also boosted its 2021 revenue outlook to between $2.015 to $2.025 billion, compared to \~$2.0B analyst consensus, indicating a \~85% YoY growth at the midpoint. The company also boosted its guidance for total visits to 14.5 to 14.7 Mio, implying 37% to 39% growth, up from the prior guidance of 13.5 to 14.0 Mio visits.

During its investor day management also provided a longer-term outlook for 2024 and expects to generate in excess of $4bn in revenue in FY 2024, implying between 25-30% compounded annual revenue growth throughout 2024.

In our view, the 2024 forecast is quite impressive as it means the company will at least double its current FY 21 revenues within 3 years, at scale, which is a strong sign of confidence by management.

&#x200B;

*So What?*

Now, there are several concerns by investors that keep weighing on the stock despite strong continued growth. Most importantly, investors fear that Teladoc's growth rates cannot be sustained. This is a valid concern which is already visible in many of Teladoc's metrics, including:

Revenue growth, where the growth rate declined to 81% in Q3 from 109% in Q2 2021. And while the revenue outlook for FY 2021 indicates a robust 85% growth rate (vs. 98% YoY growth in 2020), it's probably the 2022 outlook that surprised investors where management provided a preliminary outlook of $2.6bn in FY22 revenue, implying only 28-29% growth vs. FY 2021.

The growth deceleration is also visible in the customer metrics as U.S. Paid Members came in at \~2% YoY growth, a deceleration from 41% growth for FY 2020, and 20% YoY growth in Q1 2021.

There are two additional concerns that weigh on the stock: one is the above-mentioned concern on profitability. On the surface, Teladoc's net loss during the past nine months increased roughly 4-fold compared to the first nine months of 2020 with current 9-month net loss of $(417.8) million compared to $(91.2) million for the first 9 months of 2020. However, as outlined above, most of this is driven by SBC in relation to the Livongo acquisition which should have a declining impact moving forward.

Lastly, there is competition, which is trying to eat away Teladoc's lunch. Competitors like Amwell (AMWL) continue to expand their services which could become a threat to Teladoc in the fight for market share. In addition, big players are also expanding their telehealth capabilities, e.g. insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) through its acquisition of MDLive, or Amazon (AMZN) who is significantly expanding its Amazon Care ambition. It's important to highlight again that the market is still very fragmented but only a few have achieved to operate at significant scale, including Teladoc. And Teladoc continues to expand its service offerings, including its recently launched mental health service myStrength Complete, which integrates capabilities to deliver comprehensive virtual mental care delivery, which were shown to have the highest penetration rates at the moment (see McKinsey data above).

Teladoc is further expanding in the US but also internationally which is key to maintaining and build out its leadership position:

In Q3, Teladoc has signed new agreements with CVS Health and Centene to on Teladoc's Health's Primary360 platform.

Teladoc was selected as a vendor by Canada Health Infoway for its whole-person care services, which serve approximately 60% of Canada's population.

Announced a strategic partnership with Philips to deliver virtual healthcare solutions in Australia and New Zealand.

Signed an agreement with giant Latin American telecom company Telefonica, which expands the existing partnership to make Teladoc's services available to over 60 million people in Brazil.

Announced a collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to integrate Teladoc's solo platform for health systems into Microsoft Teams to streamline clinician workflows into a unified experience.

Not to forget, in midst of the pandemic Teladoc made a key strategic acquisition with Livongo, a leader in the virtual diabetes and chronic disease management space, which gave the company access to key technological properties that are now leveraged within other services, including the recently launched mental health service, myStrength Complete. The Livongo contribution is paying off nicely as member data points continued to increase significantly, showing over 100% YoY growth to 1.99 billion (cumulative).

All of this also contributed to the fact that Teladoc ranked highest among direct-to-consumer providers in the J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Telehealth Satisfaction Study nearly 30 points above the category average, outperforming all other providers. Teladoc is continuing to provide industry-leading quality of services while expanding geographically and from a product-offerings perspective which is key to maintaining its leadership position moving forward.",2021-12-02 09:26:51

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are set to open slightly higher this morning after we saw some renewed strength in the market yesterday. Investors seem to be brushing the omicron variant concerns to the side, although uncertainty regarding lockdowns and travel restrictions is still looming. Germany announced a nationwide lockdown of the unvaccinated, and it will be interesting to see if we more countries follow suit. I doubt the US will have any lockdowns, but that could certainly have an immediate effect on the market. Lots of movement in the major indices over the past few days, and that will likely be the same today.   

SPY is trading just under 458. Relevant resistance at 460, with support around 455. If we break down back below the SMA(50) at \~453.10, we could see more downwards movement. If we hold up above that 455 level, I'll be watching for more upwards movement. DIA is trading a bit over 347. Potential support at 345, with pretty significant resistance at 350. QQQ is trading a bit under 391. I'll be watching the 390 level as potential support. Gold and silver are each up a bit this morning. Crude oil is up as well, but still trading under the $70 level. Bitcoin is currently trading around 57,000. It appears to have found support around the 56,000 level, and looks primed for more upwards movement after the recent consolidation. Ethereum is trading just over 4,600. I'll be watching the 4,700 level as potential resistance, but we could see a push to fresh ATH in the near future. Crypto-related stocks are trading slightly higher in premarket. Airlines and cruise stocks are looking mixed this morning, likely due to the uncertainty around the omicron variant. They are still trading under the previous support levels.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",2021-12-03 08:36:33

Stocks sank today to end the week lower, with technology and growth stocks cratering as market participants digested further updates regarding the Omicron variant and recent marks made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, alongside the Labor Department’s November jobs report. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the week -1.2% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slid -2.6% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell -1.83%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week a whopping -5.24% lower. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.87%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.74%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.11%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.05%
* VIX: +8.71%
* NVIDIA: -4.46%
* Tesla (TSLA): -6.42%
* DocuSign (DOCU): -42.22%
* Asana (ASAN): -26.40%
* Marvell Tech (MRVL): +17.70%

Development surrounding the new Omicron variant remains front and center of the market’s attention. So far, at least five US states have reported at least one case of the variant and over three dozen countries globally. A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far seen “a suggestion that there is increased transmissibility” of the Omicron variant. However, the report notes that it is still too soon and not enough data is available to make any conclusions yet. 

Vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, “There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”

Moreover, the market move today coincides with the release of the Labor Department’s November job report, which showed a disappointing hiring rate even as the unemployment rate fell to a fresh pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers

* Payroll Gains: +210,000 vs +550,000 expected
* Unemployment Rate: 4.2% vs 4.6% in October

Jim Smiegiel, Chief Investment Officer at SEI Investments, said “The markets ... have been pricing in, really, a worst-case scenario. I think the market is now switching gears a little bit and perhaps lessening the intensity of the potential for negative outcomes. The big issue still remains more about the world government's reaction to the variant and what that means from a lockdown perspective. And that's what the market is still kind of struggling with at this stage."" 

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond-buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory."" 

On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying (no more than ¼ position). As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) cratered more than 40% after posting disappointing earnings and lowering guidance. Like Zoom (ZM), Teladoc (TDOC), and Peloton (PTON) before, this is the latest COVID stock to crater in value. 
* Shares of Chinese ride-hailing company DIDI gapped down once again after announcing plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange amid regulatory pressures from the Chinese government. This is one of the most spectacular IPO failures I have ever seen and probably just the beginning. I’m glad I divested all my shares in Chinese companies, I wouldn’t trust a single dollar of mine in that environment. At this point, I’m expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. 
* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you aren’t really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company
* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. 
* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. 
* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. 
* Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. 
* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  
* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go. QCOM said it partnered with hardware company Razer to create an initial test device for gamers.

667,Pandemic stocks Valuation after the recent selloff,"Source: https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/1466873029716328448

Price to Sales ratio high -> today

$ZM: 117 -> 14

$LMND: 107 -> 24

$PLTR: 46 -> 25

$STNE: 44 -> 7

$TWLO: 37 -> 16

$PINS: 30 -> 10

$DOCU: 41 -> 14

$TWLO: 36 -> 16

$ROKU: 34 -> 11

$BYND: 30 -> 9

$HOOD: 26 -> 9

$CHGG: 23 -> 5

$PTON: 21 -> 3

$TDOC: 21 -> 7

$TWTR: 17 -> 7

$Z: 12 -> 3

Some really interesting prices here. Some still seem overvalued, others now seem close to being cheap. Keep in mind Nasdaq has traditionally had a P/S ratio of around 3, and SPY is currently at 3 p/s (though will probably improve significantly in 2022 due to reopening/travel recovery). 

**Peloton** in particular is now at the same P/S ratio it had in March 2020 and yet has tripled its subscriber base over that duration (ie - juicy, recurring revenue). This is **before** all of the Q/E and money printing we had, as well as higher interest rates before March 2020.

Same for **Roku** - it is now at March 2020 sales valuations, but over that duration it has grown it's revenue from $1.13b to $2.8b (taking in q4 revenues for 2021), a growth of 147% over 2 years, and doubled it's ARPU.

**PINS** could have very strong upside as well when sentiment in the stock market improves. Just at a glance it's profit margins are really good and they are very close to achieving profitability. I think a lot of these social media stocks could be a bargain once they navigate through the Iphone Ad Apocalypse©️. 

I think **Zillow** could be worth taking a look as well. I mean yeah, the business fucked up, but Cathie Wood's selloff means it probably got oversold based on it's current financials and future prospects. The loss they took from their fuckup was not that big

I am worried about **PLTR** as it still has 25x sales even after the selloff, and with the stock dilution there's a good chance big money might be waiting for further selloff before becoming interested in it again. It's a good company, but there's just so many better looking valuations in the market right now especially after the massive growth stock selloff.

669,Pandemic hype stocks are returning to May 2020 levels. What's next?,"$PTON, $DOCU, $ZM, $Z just a few to name.

Many stocks are suffering as their businesses tied to technology and innovation, many have no profit. These shares that soared last year as the pandemic hit the world. They are set to suffer now as economies reopen. Omicron was just an example of that - scare and bad new - those rise. As the situation clears they drop.

Do you have a list of stocks you plan to short before the year end?",2021-12-06 20:27:49
670,Valuation doesn't matter until it does,"I have seen a lot of post in the last year (including one two weeks ago), saying that valuation doesn't matter anymore. Well, all of those high multiples, and irrational stocks, have been tanking hard in the past two weeks. It all started when Disney and Paypal started to tank, a lot of stocks followed such as Twilo, PLTR, DKNG, SQ, ZM, meme stocks, and all the others.

Financial markets are forward looking, as announced, the FED will start tapering soon, and will increase the interest rate in 2022 most likely. So all the growth stocks will be hit by a higher expected return on the Discounted Cash Flow models, and with more conservative multiples. We can forecast a shrinking of PE / PE1 / PS ratios. However, with the bond market offering such a low yield, **we can expect higher stock multiples than usual**. A good stock with a P/E of 20 is way more attractive risk/reward than anything else. There's no place to park money, and with inflation, cash is trash.

&#x200B;

What are the opportunities this market offers?

If the elevator is going down (growth stocks), it is better to take the stairs. However, the market will still offer a great return (in my opinion) for the year 2022. Stocks selection will be crucial.

\-Cyclical stocks: With the economy re-opening, cyclical stocks will be very hot. Stocks like McDonald's, Walmart, Bath&BodyWorks, Airlines, cars marker will all beneficiate from people that cannot wait to go out to spend their money once they are allowed to do so.

\-Financials: As we said, markets are forward looking, financial stocks will beneficiate from an interest rate hike.

\-FAANG+M: Those companies rule the World. They are money printing machine, and they will all keep growing. They are a little bit more expensive, but you have to pay a premium for such quality companies that have a lot to offer.

\-Energy: This one is a shorter trade. Supply cannot keep up with demand. Joe Biden doesn't want the US to produce more oil, the OPEC+ is in the driver's seat, and US oil companies are distributing the cash to investors instead of drilling more. Price of oil will keep going up in, at least, the first half of 2022. Both Chevron and Exxon offer more than 4.5% in dividend yield, and they will see their stock price going up accordingly with oil prices.

\-Buying leaps on the SPY: It is hard to go wrong with this one. The problem with options is the timing. If you buy long duration call options on the SPY during dips, you will most likely see a profit. This one is for a bit experienced investors. Be careful to not lose all your money.

I wish you all the best luck in your investments, I hope this will help some people.",2021-12-06 20:45:36

672,Microvision (MVIS)- SIMON SAYS it's the PERFECT SHORT,"Hey guys, I'm going to detail why MVIS is an ideal short candidate, and HOW to ensure I'll NEVER get blown out short selling this stock.

At first glance MVIS appears to be bottoming (it's not). I've spent quite some time (and money) researching this company this year. I'm confident this POS has room to drop! This isn't going to be an epic instant payout like CHWY, DOCU, or ZM, although if you check the price action on some of their earnings call this year- they have a pattern of being pile-driven into the ground with good reason (20% AH last call when the CEO extended their timeline for selling their automotive lidar units). This is more of a consistent money maker until the macroeconomic climate shifts in which case it'll probably be a super printer... That being said I think the stock can drop from $6.43 to $3.00 by February EASY. 

First thing we'll look at is the borrow fee and shares available. As per iborrowdesk, laughably cheap and plentiful. As of close on Friday there is a 1.1% fee to borrow and 2,200,000 shares available.

So what? Aren't there plenty of stocks with that setup? Yes, of course- but MVIS is a highly speculative play which led to the demand for WSB's favorite: weekly options... UTT OH!!!

If you're unfamiliar with using call options to hedge against a short position you'll want to review this page:

 [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp)

Buying OTM calls gives you the right to own 100 shares of a stock at the price you choose. For a mere $5 dollars ($0.05 in options display) I can buy the weekly $18C. The only way this stock price will move against a short seller is a big news event. If the worst happens, I'm covered on every 100 lot of shares with some cheap insurance in OTM calls. But I doubt it... Microvision has pushed back their timelines for revenue on their last EC from having direct sales of lidar in Q4 originally to now 16 months from their last call (oct 28th) for their lidar to be evaluated. Revenue won't be hitting their books either for quite some time as the CEO is forecasting 2025 for vehicles with ADA's (advanced driver assistance AKA nanny tech for people who can't drive well themselves) to start shipping.

EC Transcript:

[https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_1492ca296573e31026a18a9bd9058b30/microvision/db/1111/9879/file/Q3+2021+MVIS+Transcript+pdf.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1492ca296573e31026a18a9bd9058b30/microvision/db/1111/9879/file/Q3+2021+MVIS+Transcript+pdf.pdf)

The only reason to hedge this play with OTM call options is a surprise announcement regarding different IP that Microvision holds. Even if this works against you, if you do it right you can make money on the way up just as easily. Work the math between the borrow rate and the hedge's strike price and calculate the various scenarios yourself. MSFT's Hololens 2 (a NON consumer product) utilizes the light engine that MVIS developed. The speculative royalty amount is about $13 per unit, but some research should tell you that MVIS still has a $10M prepayment as a liability on their balance sheet regarding this. And their last earnings call did not show any substantial increase in revenue.

Either way, hololens 2 goes for $5,000 a unit and theres not much out there right now in terms of software. The Microvision CEO himself says the company is pursuing automotive lidar because the AR revolution is still a ways off. 

The same tech is most likely in the Army's IVAS (integrated visual augmentation system), but no worries, ANOTHER DELAY:

[https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2021/10/army-delays-22-billion-augmented-reality-goggle-program/](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2021/10/army-delays-22-billion-augmented-reality-goggle-program/)

It's gets better (or worse if you're long). The company this year has displayed some extremely poor financial management and maneuvering. On Feb. 16 they entered into a $50M at the market offering with Craig Hallum. They said that this should give them ""sufficient runway"" for the next year.

[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/02/16/2176640/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-50-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/02/16/2176640/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-50-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html)

Just a few short months later in June, they decided to do ANOTHER $150M ATM, further diluting shareholders. But instead of actually completing the offering and raising funds, on the following EC they told the investors that they only COLLECTED HALF of it! LOLOL so now an OPEN ATM to the tune of around $75M hangs over the head of investors. You can't make this stuff up! It totally disincentivizes new investors from hoping on board because the moment the stock goes up, they're grabbing more cash and diluting shareholders again. 

Let's think about this, they miscalculated once and had to raise funds by an amount of $150 million, they're liable to do so again.

And they're DEFINITELY going for that cash next chance they get because even though they're not making substantial revenue in the next few years, they have the balls to HIRE LIKE CRAZY. I predict someone will attempt to frame this as ""BAFF"" but it's an actual bath they're taking with this financial mismanagement. I think the last CFO Steve Holt knew how in the wrong the company was behaving so he couldn't take it and retired. That's my speculative guess, but this guy has tons of stock options and NEVER exercises them which bring me to my next case builder.

**SIMON SAYS THE STOCK GOES DOWN:**

Last Thursday evening Microvision investors were treated with a surprise email. Long time BOD member Simon Biddiscombe decided to dispose of 30,000 shares of MVIS at a price of $6.94 per share. 

[https://www.benzinga.com/secfilings/21/12/24538498/microvision-inc-biddiscombe-simon-director-sells-30-000-avg-price-6-89-form4](https://www.benzinga.com/secfilings/21/12/24538498/microvision-inc-biddiscombe-simon-director-sells-30-000-avg-price-6-89-form4)

MVIS bulls are wondering why would he sell ahead of the upcoming ""catalyst"" of the CES event in Las Vegas, my guess he knows its going to be a big dud like the ""IAA mobility event"" in Germany, in which all reputable tech media sources ignored Microvision forcing the CEO to do an interview with [InvestorPlace.com](https://InvestorPlace.com) (a site that historically bashes the company). 

The company is posturing itself as a cash grab scam, they want to hire hire hire without showing investors how they plan to increase revenue ""We expect that by the end of the year we will have 100 to 110 people, a little lower than our prior guidance of 110 to 125."" Compare this to a true lean operation like INDI semiconductor and you'll start scratching your head...

This cart before the horse strategy is going to lead to them diluting the stock more, which will drive it down further... I wouldn't sweat a buyout situation at all now while shorting this, as I theorize a hostile takeover is the only possible way the company is acquired. What kind of company is going to pay many multiples of MVIS's current market cap and justify it to their shareholders? 

I sold the last of my share position on Friday and will go short this week. I will most likely ease into the short position, as IV right now is elevated compared to historical values, meaning my hedges will be slightly more expensive than usual. To take advantage I'm thinking I'll run some call credit spreads and then after the FOMC meeting wraps up this week, I'll begin shorting and buying call options (which are most likely going to expire worthless). 

Automotive lidar is about as speculative as it gets, the company is pursing it in Germany because IMO the political push back on it in the US will be too great. No one knows how having a highway full of laser beams projecting everywhere will harm the environment, and heck even Elon is saying it's fool's errand. Then realize that MVIS's product is not even certified safe for use and this looks real tasty.

From the Q2 EC:

The   commonly   accepted understanding is that a laser product that has not been CE marked in the EU or has been or –has a product report submitted to the CDRH in theU.S., maybe operated by anyone else   other   than   the   manufacturer   in   certain   cases   and   approved   and   qualified manufacturing representative.""

Puts are tough because the IV is so high on this stock (so use I use put debit spreads if I go this route). Sometimes I'll watch the options chain because big players swoop in and attempt to gamma squeeze the put options. If I see a heavy put flow I'll go for it. The other situation where they work is playing to max pain. MVIS almost never surpasses max pain, in the summer iron condors weekly were the perfect play, but now-a-days it gets crushed too far down to risk that play.",2021-12-12 18:20:15
673,Could Square's deal to buy Afterpay face the same fate as Zoom's deal to buy Five9?,"On July 18th, Five9 agreed to be acquired by Zoom (ZM was trading for around $360 per share at that time) in an all stock deal. Over the subsequent months, ZM's stock price fell by over 25% and the FIVN deal completely fell apart.

Gapping UP:

* NVAX: I'll be watching 240 as support, looking for more upwards movement if it holds up.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower to start the week. We have seen a list of European countries imposing curfews and/or travel restrictions in an effort to limit the reach of the omicron variant. The Netherlands announced a nationwide lockdown for non-essential stores, bars, and restaurants until January 14th. Investors are once again fearing the potential economic impact of the virus, and we could be in for some choppiness over the next couple weeks. In other news, Senator Joe Manchin has indicated that he would not support President Biden's Build Back Better social policy bill. The administration hopes to move forward with the bill next year.

The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq are all down over 1% as of writing this. Gold and silver are down as well. Crude oil broke down below the $70 support level, and we could be in for some more weakness given the uncertainty surrounding travel in the near future. Vaccine-related stocks are seeing some strength this morning and are worth keeping an eye on throughout the week. Technology stocks are leading the weakness this morning, and figure to see some volatility to start off the week. Energy stocks are down in premarket trading as well, but worth keeping an eye on throughout the week as energy demand could rise in the coming weeks. Chinese stocks are seeing continued weakness, and that could continue as the relationship with the U.S. continues to deteriorate. Airlines and cruise stocks are down in premarket and with many European countries imposing bans/limits on travel, the weakness could continue throughout the week. The crypto market is showing continued weakness after a choppy weekend. Bitcoin is currently trading around 45,800. Major support level at 42,000, I'll be watching closely over the next few days. Crypto-related stocks are down in premarket trading as a result of the crypto weakness. 

Remember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-12-20 09:20:52
677,Growth vs Value,"Obviously I don't know what I'm talking about cuz I'm holding the bag on some ""stay at home stocks"" like PINS (I don't think it's a stay at home stock but that's another story). Some of these stay at home stocks (TDOC, ZM, PINS for example) are back down to pre-covid levels while have revenues and profits far exceeding where they were 2 years ago while companies like Ford or GM are up upwards of 100% . Just doesn't seem to add up",2022-01-04 16:19:13
678,Stocks that will dip 50% or more in 2022?,"We've already seen a 30~50% market correction on some overvalued stocks like PLTR, DASH, PTON, ZM, RBLX in the second half of 2021. 

What stocks do you think can further crash by 50% or more in 2022?

Some companies that I'm bearish on

RIVN and LCID - Self explanatory. Still valued similarly as auto makers like BMW/GM/Daimler while selling less than 1% of their cars.

GRAB - Overvalued SEA raid hailing service. Valued at 25b with a 2b revenue while losing 2.7b last year. To compare, Uber is valued at 40b and made 14.8b last year with more or less the same losses.

SNOW - Insanely overvalued for a data cloud company. Still don't understand what's their unique selling point apart from the fact that Buffett invested early on. NET and CRWD comes to mind as well.

DASH - Just don't see the vision and valuation even if you factor in growth

PANW - Seems to be driven by momentum and nothing else. Still trying to understand why everyone is saying security will be the next big thing in 2022",2022-01-11 07:20:28

680,"Morning Update for Friday, 1/14/22","Good morning everyone. Have a nice Friday, and enjoy the long weekend :)

*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* LVS: Premarket resistance at \~42.50. Will want to see it find support above 41, could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down. Will be watching for upwards movement if it holds up.
* WYNN: Potential support levels at 91 and 90. Relevant resistance at \~95. 
* MGM: Potential support level at 46, will be watching to see if it holds up or breaks down. 
* WFC: Potential support level at 56.75. Will watch for more upwards movement if it holds up, could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down.
* UVXY: Will be looking to trade this if we see continued weakness from the overall market, I like watching SPY for reference. 

Gapping DOWN:

* NVAX: Potential support/resistance level right around \~100, will be watching for potential ORB setup. 
* MRNA: Potential support/resistance level at \~200. Will be looking for shorting opportunities if we break down and cannot recover. If it reclaims the 200 level, there is room for upside. 
* TSLA: Will be watching for shorting opportunities down towards potential support level at 1,000. Could see a retrace towards 950 support if it sees continued weakness. 
* JPM: Potential resistance level at 164. Will be watching for shorting opportunities if it fails to get back above that level. 
* NET: Looking bearish after breaking down below 100 support in yesterday's trading. Potential support at 96, will watch for shorting opportunities if it breaks down. 
* TSM: Potential support level at 135, will be watching for shorting opportunities if it breaks down. 
* ZM: Potential support level at 160, will watch for shorting opportunities if it breaks down. 
* SRC: Potential resistance level at 48. Will be watching for more weakness if it breaks down. 

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* MLCO: Potential premarket support around \~10.40. Won't be too interested in trading it if it breaks down and cannot recover. 

Not much looking great for the momentum list at the moment, could be worth running the scanner a few more times before market open. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower after we saw some selling off in yesterday's session. The Federal Reserve has indicated that they could raise interest rates ""as soon as asset purchases are terminated"". The Fed is currently on track to end the tapering process in March, so the market seems to be pricing in the likely rate hike. With inflation continuing to run rampant, financial policy will continue to be a hot topic of discussion in the coming months. Omicron concerns seem to be taking a backseat to financial policy and inflation at the moment. I think it's worth noting that the omicron strain is notably less severe; if we get a more severe mutation, it could cause real problems for global markets. 

S&P Futures are down \~60 basis points, Dow Futures are down \~60 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down \~80 basis points. Gold is trading flat this morning, while silver is down a bit. Crude oil is also trading a bit lower, but still holding above the $80 level. Banks are mixed after reporting earnings. WFC is trading slightly higher after positive results, while JPM and C are gapping down after expressing concern over rising labor costs. Semiconductor stocks are down in premarket trading after selling off on Thursday. We saw weakness from tech stocks in yesterday's session; I'll be looking for more of the same today, although we could see a bounce. Vaccine-related stocks are seeing weakness in premarket, should see heavy volume in today's session. Airlines and cruise stocks are down a bit after seeing decent strength yesterday. Most are still hovering around resistance levels. The crypto market is down a bit after seeing some more red yesterday. Bitcoin is currently trading around 42,300. We'll see if it can find support above the 40,000 level, but could be in for some more choppiness. Crypto-related stocks are down in premarket trading as a result.

Remember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2022-01-14 09:21:11
681,Is this a good buy opportunity for growth stocks?,"Given that I hold my portfolio in S&P 500 only, would it be a good opportunity to purchase different growth and/or speculative stocks?

684,Spotify ($SPOT) and the impact of FOMO - Company analysis and intrinsic valuation (value $193.43 vs price $172.98),"Spotify had huge volatility in the share price in the last 1.5 years, so I decided to take a look at the business, understand how they make money, analyze their historical performance, and lay down some assumptions to assess its intrinsic value. 

As always, below is a link to the video:

[https://youtu.be/zmQanRQ5z8s](https://youtu.be/zmQanRQ5z8s)

For those that prefer to read, below is my analysis:

Spotify adds value to the users by providing content in the form of music/podcasts and it is definitely a disruptive platform. Fundamentally, they have two types of users:

1. Ad-supported users - those that are paying for the content with their time (by occasionally having their content interrupted by an audio/video advertisement). In this case, Spotify gets advertisement revenue, but this represents only 10% of the total revenue. Of course, as the users get access to the content, 90% of all of this revenue goes to the owners of the music/podcast, so Spotify is left with a gross margin of 10%. In fact, this segment of their business is not profitable, but it serves as a stepping stone as it targets a wider audience and if they're happy with the platform and decide that it adds value, they can become premium users.
2. Premium users - those that do not want their music/podcast to be interrupted and are willing to pay a monthly subscription for that. This is 90% of their revenue and the gross margin is at around 29%. Same as in the previous case, the cost of the revenue is the royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming that is paid to certain record labels, music publishers, and other right holders, for the right to stream music to the users. This is the part that is key for their business.

The revenue growth in 2017 was close to 40%, then in 2018 and 2019 it was close to 30%, now it is close to 20%. Even though the company is growing the total revenue, these are declining growth rates.

The # of premium users has increased from 71m in 2017 to 172m reported in the last quarter (Q3-2021). However, the average monthly revenue per user has been declining from €5.32 to €4.25 in the same period. Is it worrying? It depends. I see two reasons that can justify this decline in the average revenue per user:

1. The plan chosen by the users - Spotify offers many different plans (Student plan, standard plan, duo plan, family plan...). The plans that involve more users are more expensive on an absolute basis but are cheaper per user. If more users opt for group plans, then it is not a surprise that the average revenue drops.
2. Expansion in lower-rate markets - Same as Netflix, the pricing differs between countries. If Spotify is expanding in LATAM, then the marginal revenue is lower than the average revenue.

So, we have two types of users that bring revenue to the company and a gross margin that's at around 27%. Once they cover the cost of the content, they need to cover the SG&A, R&D, and Sales/marketing expenses. Currently, they're at a point where they're covering that and they have an operating margin of close to 0%. So, looking into the future, as the economy of scale kicks in, I expect them to have a positive operating margin. How high? My assumption is 13% and here's why:

I can see them improve the gross margin and get it as high as 30% and over time, the Sales/marketing expenses and SG&A should be lower as % of the revenue. For the R&D, it could be that they remain to pour funds into that for a longer period. Of course, if you disagree with me on this assumption, at the end of this post I have a table that shows the valuation based on different scenarios (revenue growth / operating margin)

From a balance sheet point of view, there's nothing worrying. About 60% of the balance sheet (amounting to €4.3bn) is cash/cash-equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term investments. They have only €1.2bn in long-term debt and about €600m in capital leases. 

If you are confused about why I am using Euros, Spotify is a company based in Sweden and it reports all the financial numbers in Euros. So, I'll be valuing the company in the same currency and once I have the value, I'll convert that to USD to compare it with the market price.

So, here are my assumptions about the future:

Revenue growth - 20% in the next year, then 17% for the following 4 years and then slowly declining to the euros risk-free rate.

Operating margin - 0% for the next year, then improving overtime to get to the 13% in the next 6 years

Reinvestment ratio - 4 (Sales to capital) - Mainly in acquisitions as they have a lot of cash that they need to put in use and possible opening a few more offices around the world

Tax rate - 25% - although as they have €2.2bn in tax credits, they won't be paying any for quite some years.

Based on these assumptions, with a DCF model, the outcome is **€174.26 or in USD - $193.43**

I personally didn't see any fundamental change in what they've been doing or how they were growing over time that justifies the share price increase in the last 1.5 years so the decline was pretty much expected from a fundamental point of view.

Below is an overview of the value of the company based on different assumptions related to revenue growth (in 10 years) and operating margin:

685,Am I right on the calculation of compound and simple interest?,"Recently I have an argument with my friends on the use of money. I live in Norway so I use Norwegian kroner as calculation but the currency does not matter. Basically we are comparing 2 loans with cash of 500k. If I have the cash and I want to buy a 500 000kr car, should I use the money to pay down my existing housing and take a car loan or pay the car with cash?

Housing loan: 7 000 000 kr, compound interest rate of 2%, loan period of 25 years 
Car loan: 500 000kr car, simple interest rate 5%, loan period of 5 years

From my calculation, if I use the 500k in the housing loan, the monthly repayment amount re,ains the same but it will shorten the loan period to 22.5 years and save around 320 000kr from total house loan interest. Compare to if I take a car loan of 5 years, the total interest is 125 000kr.

This is clear to use 500k to pay down the housing loan, take a car loan which will save 200 000kr but my friend said we need consider future inflation so it is not worth to pay down the housing loan. He said I zm using the 500k to pay into 22years later and it is not going to worth the same.

Now I am confused. Did I missed out anything?

GRANDE PRAIRIE, AB, - TheNewswire - Feb 1, 2022 - Angkor Resources Corp. (TSXV:ANK) and (OTC:ANKOF) (“Angkor” or “the Company”) reports it has initiated a ground magnetic survey across the Canada Wall and Gossan Hills prospects on the 100% owned Andong Meas license.

The survey covers an area of 4.5 square kilometers across the Canada Wall copper/gold porphyry and extends south into the Gossan Hill prospect, where evidence of elevated rare earth elements has been shown. The magnetic lines will be spaced 25 meters per line for a total of 102 lines with a cumulative total of 173.85 linear kilometers.

With this, Dennis Ouellette describes technically what the survey will show, “Angkor hopes to be able to delineate geology boundaries, dykes, faults, and de-magnetized rock mass, which could be clay-altered zones or high mag areas corresponding to magnetite alteration. The magnetite skarn mapped earlier from surface is expected to be identified, and hopefully additional skarns will be revealed with the magnetic survey. This exercise can also prove helpful to define how the structures are tilting.",2022-02-04 01:14:50
687,Advice on Stock Picks Appreciated,"Hi all. As I feel it's a good time to buy in the market, I am looking to start averaging in and starting positions in the following stocks. I was considering around 20 in total, and perhaps $1K in each, no more than $2.5K in each. It's possible the market will continue to go down, so I want to have available monies to add.

Does this strategy seem sound? I plan to keep them long-term.

My plan would be to over time buy dips to continue building positions. I believe around 5 or so of the below could be removed, but I am most interested in your thoughts as to which should be removed.

Off the bat I notice it is tech-heavy and low on dividend.

Thank you for your help.

688,Are we prepared for Facebook (Meta) free cash flow to drop 46% in 2022!!?? Nonetheless it is still a buy,"TLDR: Meta free cash flow may drop some staggering 46% in the next year. Nonetheless it is still undervalued, having an intrinsic fair value around 309$ per share. 

Full analysis: [https://youtu.be/7lWlJizZmGk](https://youtu.be/7lWlJizZmGk)

&#x200B;

In the last conference call the CFO announced a sharp increase in operating expenses \~92 bn in 2022 (+30% YOY) along with \~31 bn in capital expenditures (+70% YOY). If you combine this with a \~15% expected revenue growth, it means that margins are going to be decimated. I calculated that operating profits will be -9% YOY in 2022 and free cash flow will be -46% YOY in 2022. Are people pricing in these awful numbers from a company that used to print high double digit growth all around? 

In spite of these terrible predictions, the free cash flow generation is still so high that the stock might still be undervalued: **309$ intrinsic value per share**. Assumptions for the DCF valuation:

* WACC: 8.6%
* revenue growth will slow down progressively to 5% in 2031
* Free cash flow margins will keep at 15.5% for the next 5 years for then increase progressively to 25% in 2031. 
* In 2031 the stock will trade at 17x FCF

&#x200B;

On one hand I feel like the market is not pricing in decrease in operating profits and FCF in the next quarters, and when those number will come there will be a lot of selling pressure. On the other hand, the core business of facebook is such a free cash flow machine that the stock is still undervalued from an intrinsic value perspective. 

Would love to hear your thoughs on what you think the intrinsic value is, and what are your thoughts on the stock.",2022-02-06 18:25:06
689,"$FB, PYPL, $ZM crashed... Looking for 1-2 year long positions","FB, PayPal, and a lot of other growth tech stocks have been hit hard. It seems like we have a nice rebound ahead. Rate will most likely be cut back as the housing demand slows in the next couple months. There are always opportunities in the water and the moves are going to be big in the coming months/years. I'm trying to find micro-caps and undervalued companies that show a lot of potential and could be prime for growth when funds re-enter the market.

Please let me know your thoughts and any other micro-caps or just anything that you're looking at for great positioning this year. I want to find something where I can hit more than 50% growth!!",2022-02-07 16:51:28
690,Don't bet against the Mouse - DIS DD,"Thesis: Disney + / Vaccines / Reopening / Rising Prices

Disney + has taken Netflix's market share. There is a set market for video streaming and with Netflix's numbers coming out we saw they are not gaining as many users as before, my thesis is that Dis+ took most of it with better kid friendly content. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11f5bxylc0


We saw what Snap did when Facebook reported they were losing marketshare, I am adopting the same thesis to Disney taking Netflix marketshare. Not to mention Encanto being one of Disneys biggest movies this quarter - https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=encanto


On Vaccines we know that more and more people are vaccinated and with both theme parks open we should see more and more people heading to parks. With JnJ reporting massive vaccine sales we should see MRNA and PFE also report the same which just means more people are vaccinated. This ties into https://allears.net/2022/01/24/we-werent-ready-for-the-crowds-in-disney-world-today/ the huge number of people just visiting all the parks.


Genie+ / Fast pass - https://touringplans.com/blog/how-to-use-disney-genie-and-lightning-lane-at-disneyland/ - Disneyland pretty much said fuck it lets charge park goers an extra $30-$50 for the same experience to save time. 


Technicals - We already saw a huge drop in DIS - https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmMP0itP/ trading at 2019 Pre Pandemic levels which is in par with the similar drops we've seen on major tech companies, so the drop is already in, with more R:R on the upside.

691,I compared ~20 ETFs to create an income portion of my portfolio,"I am building an income component to my portfolio and am looking for ETF suggestions.  The results of my research is below followed by the justification.

**Dividend Strategy (D)**

* QYLD - sell or hold  - I have a small amount but based on the analysis in the table below, I feel like I should sell and replace it with TXF-B or QQQ/SPY
* TXF-B - add more - the main provider for income so far.  I like it because it has some growth meaning the income doesn’t get smaller overtime due to inflation.  Alpha and Beta values are good.  Although the max draw down looks good compared to some other stocks, it is actually misleading.  It appears less because the fund trades in CAD but is unhedged traded in USD.  During high volatility events, USD gains strength against CAD so evaluating draw down in CAD makes it seem less significant due to some currency gains but is a bit of an unfair comparison to US market funds.
* DIVO - new small position - Holdings here diversify from the tech holdings a bit Missing - I would love to find a TXF us dollar equivalent to avoid Norbert’s gambit but QYLD, DIVO, QYLG, and others so far all seem to have a different strategy from TXF

**Capital Gain Strategy (G)** \- sell a little whenever money is needed.  This one is psychologically difficult when the market is down which makes the dividend strategy better from a stress perspective.  But performance over long time periods is definitely better with this strategy.

* TEC, QQQ, & SPY - buy
* TCLV + TULV - buy - A combination of these looks good although we only have data from a period of high volatility to evaluate it.  Forecasts indicate that the USD will likely gain strength which makes me lean to TULV but p/e and other ratios for TCLV are significantly better.  Since Jan 2021, both of these did quite well against QQQ & SPY but since they started in June 2020, QQQ has done much better ([yahoo finance comparison chart](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TCLV.TO/chart?p=TCLV.TO#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-))

**Intended allocation** (for income portion of my portfolio remember, not my actually full portfolio)

* Dividend Strategy (\~55%)
   * TXF-B 45%

   * TEC 10%
   * QQQ 10%
   * TCLV 15%
   * TULV 10%

Other notes

* Diversification is pretty weak with it being mostly tech & US based holdings (even though many are in CAD funds). I'm ok with this at the moment but **I'd love to learn about some better global ETFs from this post.**   It is hard to stray too far from tech given the returns and that we are in a technical revolution due to computers/internet which is not slowing down.
* 25% allocation seems like a lot for TCLV and TULV given their limited history

Notes:

* For CAGR, Sortino, and draw down, I used [this portfolio backtester](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio).  Draw down is calculated monthly so is not truly the maximum.
* The other data comes from Yahoo finance
* I do not have enough insight into the data to trust it 100% but seems to allow for good comparisons as long as comparing across the same data source (eg comparing yahoo to yahoo)
* Other interesting finds I’m certainly considering DFND.  Overall gain is not great, but draw down results are fantastic which is what I want for low psychological stress income based capital gains.  Performance is probably too weak for me to buy though
* With regards to other popular choices (such as NUSI, JEPI, QYLD, VDY, QYLG, SCHD), they do not appear to perform as well as the ones I have chosen.  The yields and monthly payouts are excellent which certainly could be the only factor that is important to some people.  However, when factoring growth and related risk portfolio, they don't seem to be superior to other options that meet my current goals.",2022-02-14 11:09:53

#Stock market faces the most ‘massive misallocation’ of ‘capital in the history of mankind,’ says ARK’s Cathie Wood

*Published: Feb. 17, 2022 at 1:51 p.m. ET
By Mark DeCambre*

> Cathie Wood, the star fund manager and chief executive of ARK Invest, took to CNBC to defend the woeful performance of the manager’s suite of disruptive innovation funds.

> Wood told the business network in a Thursday interview that the gravitation of money managers toward benchmarks, rather than taking risk on what she views as potentially game-changing technology in gene editing, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, among others, was creating a “massive misallocation of capital” in markets that could be the biggest in “the history of mankind.”
“Benchmarks are where they are because of past successes…If we are right, those are the companies that will be disrupted,” she said on CNBC.  

> She said “absolutely,” when asked if some of the companies her funds have invested in, which enjoyed nearly parabolic run-ups during the height of the pandemic-fueled worries in 2020, would return to their pandemic heights.

> So far in 2022, each of the flagship ARK Innovation’s ARKK, -5.63% 40 holdings had fallen more than 10%. The fund itself has slumped 26% year to date, and lost more than half its value over the past 12 months, FactSet data show:

**[SEE CHART: https://archive.today/BXYwK]**

> By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.49% was down 5% in the year to date, the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.74% was trading 7.4% over the same period, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.30% has declined by 11.5% and the large-capitalization Nasdaq-100 index NDX, -2.30% was off 12.4%, as of Thursday afternoon.

> Wood said the shares of all of the companies that ARK has bought in its various funds would return to lofty heights and trade well beyond their pandemic tops, including investments in companies such as Roblox Corp. RBLX, 0.85%, Teladoc Health TDOC, -3.38% and Zoom Video Communications ZM, -5.75%.

> “We are not going back to the old ways of doing things,” she said about the surge in value in the cache of stocks bought by ARK that saw revenue accelerate during the COVID public health crisis.
She also made the case that mature growth companies, including those considered in the FAANG category, such as Meta Platforms FB, -2.71% (formerly known as Facebook Inc.), Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.82%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.17%, Netflix NFLX, -1.97% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOG, -2.70% GOOGL, -2.85%, would face bigger challenges, if interest rates rise and inflation pressures persist, than her disruptive innovative investments.

> “The companies that are going to be hurt most by inflation and interest rates—if they are going to be a problem—are those that are in the mature growth category,” she said.

> She reiterated that investors in ARK need to maintain a 5-year time horizon to eventually reap investment rewards.

> “If we are right and the growth rate [is]15% on an annualized rate over the next five years, interest rates and inflation are not going to be a problem for,” ARK’s investments, she said.

> To those who are betting on the failure of ARK, Wood said the idea of shorting innovation is “ridiculous,” referencing funds, including Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF SARK, 5.69%, which can be used to wager against ARK’s roster of investments.

> “The idea of shorting innovation in America is ridiculous, I think,” she said.

> “The pendulum has swung…and if we are right, the rewards are going to be enormous,” she said. (It is worth noting that Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital, has said that his fund is geared toward those who want to take the other side of Wood’s bets as well those who are simply looking to protect against losses on such investments.)

> Meanwhile, Wood also said that more than half of her personal net worth was tied up in ARK and its funds and that she feels the pain of investors who are suffering through current declines.",2022-02-18 00:42:00
693,Notable Tech/Software Companies with High FCF Yield %,"Take this long weekend to seriously think about upgrading to quality while many of these names across the board have seriously pulled back. I've broken out two different groups below based around FCF Yield % and this years projected growth. 

FCF Yield % is personally one of my favorite metrics in investing and really grabs an idea for a companies internal profitability in respect to their enterprise value.

# Group 1: >2.5% FCF Yield %

1. Meta Platform (FB) - 7.4%
2. Zoom (ZM) - 5.0%
3. Alphabet (GOOGL) - 4.1%
4. Nice (NICE) - 3.3%
5. Adobe (ADBE)  - 3.2%
6. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - 2.9%
7. Microsoft (MSFT) - 2.8%
8. AutoDesk (ADSK) - 2.8%
9. Salesforce (CRM) - 2.7%
10. Workday (WDAY) - 2.6%

# Group 2: >25% Projected 2022 Rev Growth + >0.8% FCF Yield %

1. Expensify (EXFY) - 2.1%
2. ServiceNow (NOW) - 1.6%
3. Palantir (PLTR) - 1.5%
4. ZoomInfo (ZI) - 1.2%
5. JFrog (FROG) - 1.2%
6. Crowdstrike (CRWD) - 1.1%
7. Doximity (DOCS) - 1.1%
8. Zendesk (ZEN) - 1.1%
9. Atlassian (TEAM) - 1.1%
10. Semrush (SEMR) - 1.0%
11. HubSpot (HUBS) - 0.9%
12. The Trade Desk (TTD) - 0.9%

I personally think this is a great two groups to fish from depending on what you value more as an investor (growth vs relative value). You will have another opportunity to buy back your favorite story stock I promise you. 

Personally I'm eyeing Adobe, Alphabet, Palo Alto Networks, ServiceNow, Zendesk,  and HubSpot for my next buys (three from each group)

And this is just a few. Add IPOs of 2020 to this. Add not that bad small caps, some of them are beaten down 85%+. Yeah, there are few winners, like Apple, Tesla, AMD, Google, Amazon (which has been pinpointed around the same level for more than a year), but it looks like the pullback is so huge, that 2 years of gains are basically wiped out of the market for many many stocks.

It almost feels like 7+ Trillion bucks that FED printed are flushed down the toilet. Was it worth it, to destroy economy with printed money, if stock market was meant to crash anyway?",2022-02-18 22:36:47
695,You're top 3 stops as of today," With the market going down a bunch especially the nasdaq, list you're top 3 stocks as of today if you had to buy. Who knows where the bottom is, but the bottom has to be within 20% away most likely.  I will start.

ZM- It's almost a household name and is now down 73% from ATH. A few months before the start of Covid it was at 100, now its at 120.

SBE- Kind of Risky and I like it more if it goes lower. Its a Russia bank and all these countries will have to continue to buy oil from Russia.

ETSY- Now approaching household name status. Way more room to grow, down 63% from ATH. Low PE.",2022-02-23 19:02:27

# **With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
> Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.
*****
> “Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
> Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.
*****
> “I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”
*****
> # Market reversal
> The S&P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.
*****
> “Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”
*****
> Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.
*****
> “The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”
*****
> Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.
*****
> “In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.
*****
> # Fed rate hikes
> Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.
*****
> “We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”
*****
> Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.
*****
> “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.
*****
> However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.
*****
> “It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.
*****
> Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.
*****
> He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.
*****
> # Jobs, jobs, jobs
> In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.
*****
> Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.
*****
> “We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.
*****
> # Boiling oil
> Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.
*****
> “That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.
*****
> # Bullish bet?
> Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.
*****
> But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.
*****
> “We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.
*****
> Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.
*****
> The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.
*****
> The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.
*****
> Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.
*****
> “It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&P futures.

> # Cold War 2.0 – Midterm Bottom Nears

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/feb25bd4cdbe0ffd38abe3b85d7ef57c/ec436ef0b8793cc1-b0/s500x750/1a889a3555ac7f2bd39bd75e8f97cd37e16a7d3c.jpg))**

> In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.

> It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.

> However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.

> Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.

> # Stocks Move Into A Correction

> For the first time since March 2020, the S&P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?

> “Let’s remember the S&P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png))**

> What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.

> With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.

> # March Almanac: Stronger in Midterm Years

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cad7fd5b775831b161f6fc6bae6c0cf3/60038cec3dd948c5-b9/s500x750/59653b47e7587257652fa17d91ae4d0d0b6297c3.jpg))**

> As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 & 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.

> Normally a solid performing market month, March improves in midterm-election years. In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best. DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been up for five of the last six midterm Marchs.

> # 11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine

> Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”

> Here we list 11 things you need to know.
> * While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
> * Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> * Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.
> * Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

> * We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.
> * As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

> * Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.
> * European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.
> * There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.
> * Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**

> * From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.

> This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.

> # What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?

> Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.

> “The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”

> The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

> As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.

> Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

> The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

> After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.

697,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 28th, 2022","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 28th, 2022.

# **With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
> Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.
*****
> “Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
> Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.
*****
> “I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”
*****
> # Market reversal
> The S&P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.
*****
> “Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”
*****
> Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.
*****
> “The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”
*****
> Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.
*****
> “In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.
*****
> # Fed rate hikes
> Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.
*****
> “We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”
*****
> Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.
*****
> “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.
*****
> However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.
*****
> “It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.
*****
> Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.
*****
> He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.
*****
> # Jobs, jobs, jobs
> In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.
*****
> Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.
*****
> “We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.
*****
> # Boiling oil
> Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.
*****
> “That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.
*****
> # Bullish bet?
> Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.
*****
> But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.
*****
> “We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.
*****
> Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.
*****
> The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.
*****
> The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.
*****
> Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.
*****
> “It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&P futures.

> # Cold War 2.0 – Midterm Bottom Nears

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/feb25bd4cdbe0ffd38abe3b85d7ef57c/ec436ef0b8793cc1-b0/s500x750/1a889a3555ac7f2bd39bd75e8f97cd37e16a7d3c.jpg))**

> In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.

> It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.

> However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.

> Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.

> # Stocks Move Into A Correction

> For the first time since March 2020, the S&P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?

> “Let’s remember the S&P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png))**

> What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-2.png))**

> With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.

> As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 & 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81721f651699b34d9ab5f80019ec5ecb/60038cec3dd948c5-ce/s500x750/d3957fc5a070554b930922fc7884d8a14ca1b420.jpg))**

> Normally a solid performing market month, March improves in midterm-election years. In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best. DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been up for five of the last six midterm Marchs.

> # 11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine

> Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”

> Here we list 11 things you need to know.
> * While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
> * Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> * Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.
> * Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

> * We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.
> * As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

> * Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.
> * European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.
> * There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.
> * Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**

> * From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.

> This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.

> # What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?

> Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.

> “The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”

> The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

> As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.

> Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

> The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

> After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.

698,Some details on MetalSwap testnet Phase 2:,"#  Phase 2: Launched!

 Hey folks!  
**Phase 2 of the legendary MetalSwap’s TestNet has officially started!**  
As you may have noticed, our **KovanApp** on [test.metalswap.finance](http://test.metalswap.finance/) has a brand-new make-up! We remember [from our last deep-dive](https://medium.com/metalswap/testnet-online-f59581ed60be) into MetalSwap’s testnet that:

>***To participate in our testnet, you will need to have the first, or both, of the following tokens*** *accounted in your address:*  
***-*** ***Kovan ETH*** *(can be requested* [***here***](https://faucets.chain.link/)*)*  
***- MetalSwap’s USDTtest*** *airdropped through our* [***form***](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2uphA5s9lDwasjHeEwl_3ST323UUImaYq275Jmg_2seFqDg/viewform?ts=61f70f15) *compiling*

*Let’s take a look at what’s new!*

First of all, the **Balancer Swap:**

 Here we can see the swap balance between the two pools, and **whether you can open new swaps or have to wait** for the pools to be rebalanced.  
The balancer mechanism is of fundamental importance for our back-end, sometimes you will see the message “USDT(or ETH) swap not allowed”: **the saving mechanism for ongoing positions has kicked in**, and our devs can now accurately monitor the automations of their algorithms.

Then, the **InfoBox!**

&#x200B;

 

Here you will find **some useful information** regarding ongoing swaps, and some help to better understand the context of the page.

In addition to **a new graphic design**, we have added something very popular on our social channels: **the day picker for expiral dates**!  
Now instead of a total of 5 choices, you can easily choose a date on the calendar! The further away the expiral date, the more XMTtests you will receive as a reward once the swap is over!

&#x200B;

700,Zoom's Pandemic Growth Stops,"Shares of Zoom (Nasdaq: ZM) dropped 1.96% in after-hours trading on Monday after the technology company posted mixed earnings.

Financials: Zoom reported earnings per share of $1.29 and revenue of $1.07 billion; both were better than expected.

The Good: The company said it will repurchase up to $1 billion in stock.

Bad Outlook: The problem with Zoom was its guidance. The company expects to have revenue in the first quarter to be between $1.070 billion and $1.075 billion, and revenue for the full year to be between $4.530 billion and $4.550 billion. Wall Street expected Zoom to have higher projections.

Big Picture: Zoom was the darling of Wall Street during the pandemic. The number of users grew rapidly in 2020. But now that the pandemic is ending, Zoom is having trouble maintaining the same user growth. The stock is down 67% in the past 12 months.

Final Thoughts: The good news is that as hybrid work becomes more acceptable, Zoom’s enterprise business could grow.

\-8% AAPL

\-40% FB

\-12% MSFT

\-20% AMD

\-20% NVDA

Which obviously means they will regain these losses and breach their ATH when everyone inevitably calms down from all of this mess

\-Rate hikes (Lots of historical data that shows these are very positive for the markets) (Please J.P just do it)

\-War  (the worst thing that could have happened happened which was the start of it (Stocks down), now the only thing that can happen is for it to end which means  (stocks up)

\-Presidential cycles in the u.s (basically the second year is often the most volatile at the start but is followed by a  positive third year ) (stocks up)

\-Leading economic indicators (LEI) for the US are in a big uptrend (stocks up and no fear of a recession for now) (Gay bears will literally go extinct)

\-Production for Oil and Gas is increasing which means these rallies in commodities will calm down and return to historical averages some time this year (fuck you XOM)

\-Covid regulations and shit are slowly disappearing so there won't be the uncertainties for businesses and people will be more optimistic of the future (stocks up) (And ZM will keep falling)

\-Inflation's rise is slowing and in some countries have already began to drop (Japan, China)

Although this prediction might not work if a nuke drops on my polish ass

and you can continue to buy spy puts

704,Intel (INTC) - DCF & Due Diligence - New Management and Future Growth Around the Corner. Valuation Between $257Bn - $307Bn ($63.16 - $75.23 / Share),"Took a look at Intel recently and like the way things will be looking in the next few years based of management expectations. If you don't want to read, YouTube video available here: [https://youtu.be/n2WFUDxHo7E](https://youtu.be/n2WFUDxHo7E)

***Key Highlights from Filings:*** 

* Intel has been going through a pretty big shake up in the last year or so, this all started when Third Point (Activist Investors) put some pressure on the company
* As a result of this the company has hired a new CEO, CPO, CGAO, CFO, and CCO - Basically they have turned over the top brass for the most part and started to implement a new strategy to grow the stagnated firm
* IDM 2.0 is Pat's (CEO) strategy to invest in foundries to secure their supply chain and manufacturing while reducing costs. This will cost \~$50Bn in capital investments over the next few years to build out 4 foundries (2 in Arizona, 2 in Ohio, along with updating 3 foundries in New Mexico, Malaysia, and Rio Rancho)
* They plan to take their Mobileye division public this year, current estimates put the valuation at around $50bn. Intel will maintain a majority ownership of the company
* The company is anticipating improved margins and revenue growth after these facilities are completed in the coming years, press release here: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-highlights-2022-long-term-growth-strategy-investor-meeting.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-highlights-2022-long-term-growth-strategy-investor-meeting.html)
* Intel appears to be in a good place and has a solid strategy in place with new management

***Valuation:*** [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BEkF-WokspDTHF3JVgXmsJGuZ4ro8w-K/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111740554424893797741&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BEkF-WokspDTHF3JVgXmsJGuZ4ro8w-K/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111740554424893797741&rtpof=true&sd=true)

* You can download my model by using the link above and going to file -> download. This will allow you to tweak any of my adjustments / check my work. Please let me know if something looks off in the model
* I've applied management guidance for all years based off the above press release
* This assumes moderate revenue growth with high capex over the coming years leading to a negative cash flow to be turned around a few years out when investments in the new foundries are complete and revenue will start to tick back up
* WACC I've sensitized from 6-10%, I feel like 8% is probably pretty fair for a company that is as large and stable as Intel

***Conclusion:***

* I think Intel looks great and has a good new management team attached to them. They are in just about every sector that uses semi-conductors and with the imminent IPO of Mobileye I think this will unlock a lot more value for investors
* We are at an exciting time in history where just about [everything](https://www.trypura.com/?gc_id=1650507019&h_ad_id=358120948263&gclid=Cj0KCQiAmpyRBhC-ARIsABs2EAoH2OUzYDFoZmQEsMZs7IAcFe2pHCGxy7AupjW24fp1YVbRfq8CfuIaArdzEALw_wcB) is being connected to the internet and Intel is in a great position to be a part of every aspect of this transition and be a leader in the space
* I believe with fresh new leadership with a solid investments to secure production and control costs Intel has a bright future ahead of them

Thanks for making it this far! If you have any questions about my thought process or DCF feel free to let me know and I will try and answer.

As always I am not a professional investor, hold no position in Intel, and do these valuations for fun. They are not to be taken as investment advice.",2022-03-08 22:42:21
705,Is there a way to know WHEN an analyst is going to review a stock?,"Is there a way to check when an analyst is going to upgrade, downgrade, etc. a stock in the same way we know when a stock's earnings report is? For example, I bought puts on ZM and the very next day an analyst upgraded it and ruined my puts.

706,Zoom analysis and valuation - The winner of the pandemic is back to reality ($ZM) value $78 vs price $116,"Zoom's share price went wild from around $70 prior to the pandemic to its all-time high of over $550! What followed after that was a decline of around 80% (Now trading at $116/share).

This post is an attempt to provide some information behind the volatility, the irrational stock price movement as well as to value Zoom as a company, today.

**What is Zoom?**

If I have to describe Zoom in one sentence, that would be ""A company that provides a communication platform"".

Yes, there are different packages that it offers, different features and offerings (Zoom meetings, Phone, Events & Webinar, Rooms, etc), but it all goes back to solving one problem --> How can individuals remain connected and collaborate when physically not close to each other?

**The IPO**

In the case of Zoom, I do believe that going back to April 2019 is important. The IPO is an important event as it allows the company to raise funds from the public so it can continue expanding its operations and also allow the initial investors to exit and make a return on their initial investments.

The determination of the IPO price is not a process that is done within minutes. It takes a lot of time and takes into account a lot of factors, not from a valuation point of view, but also from a pricing standpoint. In the end, the goal of the management (often time with some investment bank) is to figure out, what is the highest price that the public will pay?

The IPO price was set at $36/share. On the first day of trading, it went up to $66/share, almost double. What does this mean? The public was either:

1. Paying a premium and seeing Zoom as a company that's less risky than the average company on the market; or
2. Had higher expectations of Zoom than the management of Zoom (Otherwise they would've set the IPO price at $66/share)

**The financial performance**

The company's revenue grew from $331m in 2018 to:

\- $623m in 2019 (up 88%)

\- $2.7b in 2020 (up 325%)

\- $4.1b in 2021 (up 55%)

This growth is not something that we have seen that often and the pandemic was the main impact of it. However, the forecast for the next year is roughly 10% and that's not surprising.

Every individual/organization that needed Zoom or any other platform of this kind, well, they have become customers. The expansion ahead is very limited and there might be a reversal in terms of the number of customers. Schools for example would not need Zoom as much when everyone goes back there physically.

At the same time, the operating margin expanded from 2% to 26%. 

On one side, their gross margin decreased due to the increased demand. In order to provide the service on short notice, the direct costs for Zoom increased. However, the main increase of the margin came from the reduction of Sales & Marketing costs as a % of the revenue. Back in 2018/2019, Zoom had to spend more (per $ in revenue) to reach potential customers. In 2020/2021, the customers would go to Zoom as they needed such a platform. So, although the Sales and marketing in absolute value increased (from $331m in 2018 to $1.1b in 2021), as a % of the revenue it decreased from 56% to 28%.

**The financial position**

If we take a look at the financial position, Zoom is a dream company for every investor. It has $5.9b in cash, short-term and long-term investments with no debt apart from the $40m capital leases.

The management has been authorized to use $1bn in the next 2 years for share buybacks.

**So, how much is Zoom worth?**

Of course, every valuation has certain assumptions:

**Revenue growth:** 10% in the next 5 years, then slowly decline to the risk-free rate by year 10.

**Operating margin**: To slowly improve to 28% (mainly due to increase in gross margin)

**Discount rate:** 7.93% - based on WACC (assuming a beta of 1)

Putting all of the numbers together, the value/share of Zoom is around $78, much lower than the current market price of $116.

Could be I wrong? Absolutely. Below is a table that calculates the fair value/share based on different assumptions about the revenue of the company in 10 years and the operating margin.

|Revenue / Op. margin|26%|28%|30%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|80% ($7.4b)|$67.6|$71.5|$75.4|
|108% ($8.5b)|$74.0|$78.5|$82.9|
|200% ($12.3b)|$94.5|$100.8|$107.0|
|250% ($140.4b)|$105.6|$112.8|$120.0|

If the company can grow the revenue by 250% (from $4.1b to $14.4b) in the next 10 years and improve the operating margin to 30%, Zoom could be fairly valued. Of course, that offers little to no margin of safety. 

**The market is irrational**

Let's not forget that the share price went all the way up to $550. In order to justify that, the company should've kept growing at 40-50% for the next decade! Is that feasible? I don't think so.

Often times we see price increases that cannot be justified with fundamental reasons, this is definitely one of those times.

If you have anything that's relevant for the company or the valuation, share it in the comments.

I hope you enjoyed the post, if you have any feedback, please do let me know.",2022-03-19 17:05:00

708,Buying ZIM now is like buying ZIM at 47 in mid December,"ZIM is  shipping company that is massively undervalued. It’s current P/E is 2.00 in an industry that usually trades with a P/E of 4.65 with some of the biggest names all above 5.0.  Historically this industry has traded at a P/E of 16.1 but it’s not expected that these shipping container rates will stay sky high for the next 5 years (more like 1-2) so some of that long term expectation is being accounted for. Regardless ZIM is undervalued and growing faster than it’s peers as next quarters earnings expectations show. In early May ZIM is expecting earnings per share of 12.54 vs last years 5.17 for an yoy earnings growth of 143%.

I expect this stock to flirt with $100 by next ER and should break $120 this year. Add to that some juicy dividends along the way and this is a nice stock to jump into. Let’s all make some money. Good luck and of course this is not financial advice.",2022-03-23 11:31:02

**First Column - Market Cap**

Monetary value of all outstanding shares stated in the pricing currency. Capitalization is a measure of corporate size.

**Second Column - Cash and Cash Equivalents**

Cash & Near Cash Items:

Cash in vaults and deposits in banks.

Includes ST investments with maturities of less than 90 days.

May include marketable securities and short-term investments with maturities of more than 90 days if not disclosed separately.

Excludes restricted cash (Restricted cash is included in Other Current Assets).

**Third Column - Cash Burn**

A rough estimate of how many months a company can operate using the existing cash and near cash resources without requiring additional financing. A low number of months to burnout does not necessarily indicate that the firm will run out of cash, but that if operations do not improve, the company will need to seek additional financing. Calculated as:

(Cash & Cash Equivalents / Trailing 12 Month Free Cash Flow) x 12

**Fourth Column - Total Debt to Total Assets**

Leverage ratio in percentage that defines the total amount of debt relative to assets. This enables comparisons of leverage to be made across different companies. Calculated as:

Total Debt \*100 / Total Assets

**Fifth Column - Recommendation Consensus**

Provides the analysts' opinions on the security. The Rating is calculated by converting each of the analysts' current recommendations into a number from 1-5 and taking the average

**Sixth Column - Price to Sales Ratio**

The price to sales ratio is the ratio of a stock's last price divided by sales per share.  Average shares outstanding is used when calculating sales per share.

Sales per share is calculated on a trailing 12 month basis where available.  Trailing values are calculated by adding the most recent four quarters.",2022-04-11 15:13:23

717,Jimizz - Grab the bull by the balls ! - [JMZ]," 

**What is Jimizz?**

**Jimizz**  is a cryptocurrency on the Binance Smart Chain designed by France's  leading adult entertainment provider, Jacquie&Michel, to  revolutionise the sector with new features that will benefit consumers,  creators, and investors.

For too  long, middlemen have stood between content producers and consumers,  siphoning off the work of creators to extract advertising revenue,  charging exorbitant banking fees, pushing independent producers into  ever more precarious financial positions, and censoring them in order to  appease the conservative lobbies that advocate the abolition of  pornography. For 150 years, from the invention of photography to virtual  reality, the porn industry has been quick to embrace new technologies  in order to offer an ever-improving experience to its consumers.

Today,  blockchain technology can solve all the problems that plague the  market. From pseudonyms and access by minors to fair pay for creators  and cutting out the middleman, Jimizz is a viable solution to the  persistent problems faced by the sector. But we’re looking even further  into the future here… By imagining more enjoyable, ethical, practical,  and legitimate ways to consume porn, Jimizz is here to finance a  revolution, for the benefit of creators and consumers, to shake up an  entire industry, and to drive it into a new era.

In the space of twenty years, a free HTML porn page has become the **number-one adult site in France**  and employs dozens of people in fields as varied as software  engineering, SEO expertise, web copywriting, event management,  marketing, graphic design, production, video directing and editing, and  social media management.

In 2021, there has been **25 millions unique visitors per month** on the J&M ecosystem.

J&M  has no intention on stopping there. The brand is doing everything it  can to export itself outside France and continue its international  growth by following a three-part strategy:

* Setting up teams in high-potential locations such as Barcelona, Budapest, and Rotterdam.
* Launching sites for international customers such as Pornudeo and TYJAM.

718,Zoom Meetings vs Zoom Rooms?,"My all-volunteer non-profit is using Zoom Meetings pretty successfully, but we're trying to define a configuration for ""hybrid"" meetings in a conference room space (in a Community Center--we just reserve a time.) The conference room has some A/V equipment -- display, overhead mic and camera above the display--and we've got that to work half-decently, but we're trying to learn whether Zoom Rooms would make a big difference. 

I've read the literature on the Zoom Website, but it doesn't get at some of the details that might make a difference for us. So, if anyone can address one or more of these questions, thank you! (ZM= Meetings, ZR=Zoom Rooms) 

1. Is ZR likely to enhance the connections to the conference room A/V (e.g., using some special comms protocols or making device management easier or whatever)?  
2. Does the ""virtual Gallery view"" work well (simulating individual ""hollywood squares"" of the in-room participants for the remote participants)?  If it works this seems a good benefit since one complaint is that remote users can't tell who is talking in in the in-person group.) 
3. Does that Virtual Gallery View also include some trick so that in-room participants can vote in polls, for example?  
4. In a ZR setup, is it common/normal/recommended/required that in-person participants have some sort of Zoom-connected device?  
5. The Zoom Website suggests that ZR lets all participants (local or remote) communicate easily among themselves, e.g., to share files or p2p messages. Can anyone add some detail on how this works and whether it works well and whether it depends on everyone local having a device?
6. Regarding #5:  if lots of devices are in the room, does ZR use some wireless method that does NOT result in overload of the Community Center's Guest Wifi? 
7. Does anyone have any experience with professional services design configuration services offered via Zoom?  I assume that's $$$$, right? 
8. And finally, does ZR require more ongoing in-meeting support that ZM does?  (We typically have maybe 3 of our members acting as Host or Co-Hosts during a meeting--spotlighting, running polls, etc.--, but these volunteers are also participating in the meeting discussions as well. )

Thanks for any advice/info!",2022-04-21 21:35:01
719,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 22, 2022","**Psycho’s Market Recap - Friday, April 22, 2022**

US stocks plummeted on Friday, extending this week’s selloff as market participants digested a fresh batch of corporate earnings reports and braced for more aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Fed than originally expected. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hovered around 2.9%, the highest level since December 2018. 

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -2.74%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -2.62%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -2.71%

* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.87%
* Occidental Petroleum (OXY): -4.36%
* Alcoa Corp (AA): -6.69%

The losses follow remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that signaled a 50 basis point hike to the interest rate was coming next in the next meeting, spooking investors. In particular, Powell said members of the Central Bank were committed to “front-loading” interest rate hikes in order to fight the fastest pace of inflation in over forty years. 

Addressing European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and other officials on Thursday, Powell said the Federal Reserve was committed to getting 2% inflation back, referring to the Fed’s target for annual price increases.

The Fed’s aggressive policy shift comes as the US economy stares down the barrel of a recession if inflation continues rising as growth stagnates. While the labor market remains strong, a broken supply chain, the war in Ukraine, rising prices, and slowing economic growth threaten the post-COVID economic recovery.

Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said “Today's market action reflects the power of Jerome Powell's comments yesterday, that the Fed is determined to slay climbing inflation and virtually acknowledging that the market can expect a 50 basis point hike in May.”

With the headline Consumer Price Index at its highest level in four decades, the Federal Reserve has now choice but to aggressively tighten to rein in rising price levels. That said, there is rising fear that the Fed may act too aggressively when rising rates, plummeting the US into a recession regardless. Earnings season, which has so far been mixed, will be a key indicator whether the broader economy can sustain the incoming tightening cycle. 

Deepak Puri, Chief Investment Officer at Deutsche Bank, said “The big question is whether the earnings can really sustain this kind of a macro backdrop of slower growth and Fed policy. It seems certain companies can — historically that’s been the case. What’s different this time is really the trifecta, which is higher costs of capital, quantitative tightening, plus a lack of ... a big fiscal stimulus.”

Despite worries from Wall Street and the Fed’s aggressive signal, there are some signs that we are at, or at least, approaching peak inflation. The Fed’s Beige Book, which is a region-by-region roundup of economic information from each of the Federal Reserve’s districts, showed economic activity increased at a “moderate pace” in most of its twelve districts between February and mid-April. 

The Beige Book said, “""Strong demand generally allowed firms to pass through input cost increases to customers, for example, via fuel surcharges for freight and airline fares. However, contacts in a few districts noted negative sales impacts from rising prices. Firms in most districts expected inflationary pressures to continue over the coming months.""

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a reading of 57.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
* Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday signed a bill to end Disney’s (DIS) special district designation on its theme parks.  Currently, under Florida law Disney can regulate its own power, water, and emergency services.

* ll reveal how the consumer-electronics giant is managing supply-chain and macroeconomic pressures, but it should also contain the company’s annual update on its capital-return plans and could be the “most incremental potential positive” element of Apple’s entire report, according to Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers. The company continues to be a cash-generating machine, and with its shares only yielding about 0.5%, Rakers expects that Apple could add at least $90 billion to its buyback program and raise its dividend by upward of 10%
* Cathie Wood's Ark Invest this week snapped up shares of pandemic darlings including Roblox (RBLX), Roku (ROKU), and Zoom (ZM) that have fallen out of favor this year. Her flagship fund ARKK has lost about 30% of its value in 2022.

721,POWcycle: The Endgame,"Hi, all.

1. [Beware the POWcycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u521ic/beware_the_powcycle/);

3. [POWcycle: The Next Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uja7np/powcycle_the_next_day/).

We're now in POWcycle № 11, which started on Thu 5 May 2022, and is squeezing us like a vice.

This fourth installment is my view on the cause of and endgame for the POWcycle.

**Why Did Growth Stocks Crash 70% to 90%!?**

**IMPORTANT:** Although this isn't linear, a rule of thumb is that *for each 1.00% that the Fed is expected to raise interest rates, 20.00% of a growth stock's market cap will get deleted.* In other words, if interest rates are expected to go up by 1.00%, your growth stock will crash by roughly 20.00%.

**How Did We Get to This Point?**

Growth stocks became tremendously overvalued and then institutions and very experienced investors and traders who understand how the boom-bust market cycles work took advantage of the bubble to enrich themselves at the expense of most retail investors and traders.

Generally, growth companies don't make a profit. Their expenses are higher than their revenue, and sometimes their revenue is $0. They have to get money from somewhere to pay their employees, pay for health insurance for their employees, rent space in buildings, buy computers and other equipment, etc. They often have a new product for a market (customers), but if it's a good idea, other companies, including big, profitable ones, will go after that market, so the growth company is desperate to be the first to capture customers and establish a moat to fend off competition. They prioritize growth at all costs over making a profit because they know that unless they can establish a durable base of customers, just like a rocket that fails to reach orbit, they would crash back to Earth. That is, they could easily go bankrupt, so there's enormous pressure on them to grow as quickly and as massively as possible. Those who succeed can corner a large market and make a killing, which would greatly benefit investors.

Growth companies can grow through more and more sales, which takes a great product and great marketers, and they're expensive to hire. The companies can also grow by acquiring other companies, which is astronomically expensive and involves taking on huge amounts of debt. But they caught an amazing break in 2020: free money!

In 2020, interest rates were near 0.00%. If The JPow had offered you a $1,000,000.00 loan for three years at 0.00% interest, wouldn't you have taken it and tried to make some money on it, and then paid him back the $1,000,000.00? Because growth companies are always desperate for money, they were jumping up and down for joy when The JPow fired up his printing presses and kept them going 24/7, printing jaw-dropping amounts of money (see below) and literally throwing it at every American and American business that wanted it (and even those that didn't).

Americans found themselves locked away at home, with lots of cash coming in. A huge amount of that money went into the stock market, not into slow-moving gigantic companies, but fast-moving small ones where people were able to make a 20% gain in a week, or 100% overnight via an options play. TSLA, alone, created a great number of options multi-millionaires in just a few months! Just about every well-known growth stock went parabolic, and retail investors and traders went manic. Every day on YouTube, retail traders were told to buy one stock or another, and they did, and those stocks kept rocketing up.

With access to huge sums of money, investors and traders were optimistic that growth companies could put that money to use to drastically accelerate their growth. In many cases it worked. For example, Zoom (ZM), Overstock (OSTK), and Peloton (PTON) provided near-essential services or goods to customers who were locked down at home for an indefinite time period. As long as quarterly earnings went up rapidly, so did share prices. Sales were surging, so investors and traders were willing to pay a lot, lot more for shares than they were worth because they figured that in the future, the growth stocks would grow tremendously and thus justify the ""revenue multiple"" today.

But there was a problem. Eventually, everyone had bought up all of the things that they didn't have that would enable them to work from home comfortably. Growth flatlined. And then there was another problem. We started seeing inflation. So much new money had been printed that it diluted the value (buying power) of existing money. And then, some people started returning to work, away from home, for at least a few days a week. Meanwhile, everything started getting more and more expensive, and when that happens, the Fed intervenes by raising interest rates.

That makes the cost of capital—of borrowing money—a lot more expensive for growth companies. It also makes the cost of raw materials and everything else that they buy more expensive. The money is no longer free, so future expenses increase, while growth simultaneously decreases. Suddenly, the value of that share you own in a growth company goes down. And as inflation rises, and it becomes clear that the Fed will need to be more aggressive in raising interest rates, it goes down more, and more, and a lot more. You have trouble finding buyers of your share when the company is producing rapidly declining revenue and faces rapidly increasing expenses.

When that happens, investors understandably don't want to pay a huge revenue multiple. In other words, when Zoom's share price kept going up and up, as everyone thought that lockdowns would last forever and that it was an essential business service, they were willing to pay any amount of money for it. But when it became clear that it couldn't go up forever, and had become drastically overvalued, and then started producing less and less revenue, investors understandably started selling, first slowly, and then more quickly. As many growth stocks that had benefitted from a once-in-a-lifetime event had become overvalued, and the pandemic abated and their revenue started falling while expenses were increasing, they eventually rocketed down far faster than they had rocketed up. With each quarterly earnings call that brought weaker guidance about the future, and more signs of inflation, the share prices reversed to the downside and gained momentum, eventually resulting in panic-selling in many cases, and causing huge declines.

**Just How Much ""Extra"" Money Did The JPow Print?**

He printed 41.08% more than there was right before the pandemic started. Take a look at this [graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL). And check out [the relationship between the money supply and inflation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-printing-money-supply-m2-raises-prices-level-inflation-demand-prediction-wage-stagnation-stagflation-federal-reserve-monetary-policy-11645630424).

**Why Is This So Bad?**

Imagine that there's a growth company that offers shareholders 100 shares in total, for $10.00/share. There are 100 shareholders, each of whom owns one share, including you. Then, the company issues 41 more shares. It doesn't have any greater sales, but overnight, instead of owning 1/100th of the company, you now own 1/141 of the company. You've been diluted. Your share isn't worth as much as it was.

Inflation does the same thing. What used to cost you $5.00 to buy now costs a lot more, but you still have the same amount of money. Your buying power has been reduced. What this means is that what used to cost $90,000.00 a year ago costs nearly $100,000.00 today.

Each month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the consumer price index (CPI), and other data. By monitoring it over time, we can see how core inflation is rising. You can grab the raw data [from here](https://www.bls.gov/data/#prices) and plot it in Excel.

So, if we stuff our money under our mattress, inflation will, in effect, burn up one-tenth of it (so far, at least).

Also, consider your investments. Your real rate of return is whatever percentage gain your portfolio makes less the inflation rate. A lot of capital has already been deleted through panic-selling for huge losses and as the result of margin calls, but it's still a trivially small amount relative to the sheer amount of money that The JPow printed.

**What Can Be Done About Inflation?**

When the ability to produce goods and services stays the same, but the money supply increases, it causes inflation. Supply chain problems reduce the capacity to produce goods and services on the same level as before, and that makes inflation even worse.

What, really, can be done? Interest rates need to rise to lower aggregate demand for goods and services, (some of) the ""extra"" money has to somehow get deleted, and the GDP has to grow (driven by an expanding population from immigration and new births) into the larger money supply.

The supply chain from China isn't really the problem. Decades of uncontrolled borrowing, money-printing, deficit spending, astronomical interest payments on debt, and the pandemic crisis that caused the Fed to print so much more money, which then got pumped into the stock and options markets, got us to this point. The government has consistently borrowed from the future, and from other countries, to build a bridge to that future. As long as GDP grows sufficiently to manage to pay for the interest on that borrowed money, and pay down principal, everything can be managed. But there are natural limits. If the GDP can't grow sufficiently, then we encounter all sorts of problems, the ultimate consequence of which is that the quality of life deteriorates significantly for most citizens.

**So How Does Inflation Kill Growth Stocks?**

In Jun 2020, when you bought that high-flying growth stock, you were paying 50x what the company was worth today, on the assumption that it would grow massively in ten years, and thus justify an enormous share price. But with inflation sky-high, which means that a growth company's expenses are a lot more expensive, and revenue shrinkage, that growth stock isn't worth that huge 50x multiple.

Then, in mid-Feb 2021, when growth stocks were generally at their all-time highs, and signs of inflationary pressure started to appear, no one knew exactly how bad it would be. The JPow assured us that it was transitory. The economy was strong. Nothing drastic happened, but share prices drifted down somewhat.

Each month, more and more people started paying attention to the CPI release, and noticing with growing alarm that the number was going higher and higher. Up to a week before the release, you'd see some selling in growth stocks and a price dip. Retail traders and investors, not steeped in macroeconomics and usually too young to have lived through many different macroeconomic conditions, weren't sure what was happening.

But institutions and the old guys knew exactly what it was. They sold at the top. Now, the POWcycle's wheel started turning:

POWcycle № 1: CPI release → fire-hot number → FOMC meeting → JPow press conference → ""Inflation is transitory"" → Some skepticism and selling of shares.

…

POWcycle № 4: ""OMG, the CPI release is coming up. I'm going to sell my shares, just in case."" → CPI release → fire-hot number → FOMC meeting → JPow press conference → Lots more selling → Share price drops again!

…

POWcycle № 8: CPI release → fire-hot number → FOMC meeting → JPow press conference → ""Maybe we should retire the word 'transitory'."" →""Say, what!?"" → Panic-selling → Large drop in share price.

…

POWcycle № 10: ""God, that number is going to be out-of-this-world high! I've got to sell out of this dumb company!"" → lots of selling → scary price drop → CPI release → FOMC meeting → JPow press conference, ""0.75% is off the table"" → Huge retail trader relief rally → Skepticism: ""He's lying!"" → Devastating panic-selling.

Eventually, what started with a trickle in POWcycle № 1 became the nightmare flood of POWcycle № 11 that we're enduring right now.

**How Was I Fooled So Easily?**

It started off so slowly that the countless retail investors and traders who were too young to really know about the dot com crash of 2000 or the Financial Crisis of 2008 didn't know that anything much was wrong. Besides, ""this time is different,"" many said, just as every other generation had said before them. We've never lived through a global pandemic like this. We haven't faced inflation since the early 1980's.We had only ever heard about quantitative easing, never quantitative tightening. It's understandable that there was a lot of confusion and lack of knowledge about what was likely to happen and what to do about it.

Essentially, retail traders were like frogs, boiled alive one degree at a time, not noticing that the water was getting awfully hot until it was too late.

Also, a lot of retail traders experience a very common psychological phenomenon that goes like this. ""My stock is down by 6% since last week! But it's a strong company. It'll recover. There's no way I'm going to sell my position for 6% less than I had last week!"" Because they don't understand that there's a POWcycle, and how it works, when the next POWcycle grinds the share price down further, they say to themselves, ""This doesn't make any sense, but it can't possibly go any lower. It's at major support."" The next POWcycle strikes, and now they're below the major support level, wondering what happened. It was at $300.00/share, and now it's at $260.00/share. ""I can't sell now! I'm down by a lot!"" But all this time, they have no idea what's coming: many future POWcycles that push the share price all the way down below $40.00/share!

And because a lot of retail traders focused primarily on growth stocks, because that's where the huge gains were being made, they didn't use a stop loss because that could have potentially caused them to lose some money, but they wanted to keep it all. They were so loss-averse that they were willing to keep holding, and as the share price moved down further and further below their cost basis, their grim resolve to keep holding increased. Then, they found themselves down by 90% on NVTA, one of Cathie Woods's game-changers!

Remember that 50x price-to-sales (P/S) multiple? It drifted down to 40x, then 30x, then 5x…and rocketed toward 0 like a heat-seeking missile! Seeing bright red numbers like -74%, -85%, -92% in the P&L % field of your positions is astonishing. And that's to say nothing about options traders who have outright lost vast sums of money via margin calls.

**Oh, God. My Life is Ruined! Will These Stocks Ever Recover?**

Sentiment hasn't been so negative since the Financial Crisis of 2008, when the US literally had a financial near-death experience. This is a [great documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QozGSS7QY_U) on what happened. And growth stocks seem to have crashed just as badly as during 2008, which is just insane!

The POWcycles combined with (still incredible) overvaluation, earnings misses or weakening guidance (which leads to devastating earnings crashes), supply chain constraints from lockdowns in China that affect factories and shipping, and—let's not forget—the war against Ukraine and the huge surge in energy prices, plus the fact that the viral pandemic isn't over yet, the inversion of the yield curve (which has for the past decades reliably signaled the coming of a recession within eighteen months),  the financial press writing increasingly scary stories, and tremendous panic-selling has caused growth stocks to crash from their all-time highs in Feb 2021 to, often, their all-time lows today.

*Everyone* is scared.

Studying macroeconomics in college never prepared anyone for what to do in a crisis with so many unknowns, where so many of us feel like prisoners of our houses or apartments because of the virus, which is still out there. Everyone is stressed, and that stress is getting a lot worse as 22-year-old former millionaires are now back to being thousandaires.

If you're in your twenties, your life isn't ruined. You have a long lifetime ahead, and you're learning. This will prove invaluable in the future. If you're older, even much (much) older, there's good news, too: if you can ""just"" hang on for two or three years, and **not sell**, many of the (best of the) growth stocks that you own will rocket up again. It may be hard to believe now, and three years sounds like 3,000, but if you look at history, we've seen this happen again and again. Have faith. While it's true that some stocks will never recover, don't talk yourself into panic-selling. Wait patiently. Give these stocks a chance.

Study market cycles. We're entering a scary phase. There's no doubt about that. But we will eventually exit it, and the ride up is going to last a lot longer, and give us many, many opportunities to make a great deal of money.

**How Can You Say That When It Took Many, Many Years For SPY to Reach The Same Level It Had at the Peak of the Dot Com Bubble in 2000?**

The chances are that you didn't buy everything at the peak. And even if you did, as long as you've got capital (you'll be able to keep making more from a job), even after a crash, when we know that the market is on solid ground and not going to suddenly open a trap door beneath our feet and swallow us like it's doing now, you're going to be able to make money again from investing, swing trading shares, and those incredibly lucrative options plays. And if you don't know options, and could stand to learn how to swing trade, for that matter, now's a good time to study, so that you can be prepared for when the time is right.

Yes, it took years and years for SPY to regain its high. But we don't need to wait for the market to regain a high after crashing in order to make a ton of money again, and regain and exceed **our own** portfolio's high! That's the good news, and if you want me to, I'll keep writing these messages and explain how to prepare.

**I Really Doubt Most of These Stocks I Own Will Ever Recover!**

A stock that crashes from $50.00/share to $5.00/share has lost 90.00% of its value. To go from $5.00/share back to $50.00/share would be a gain of 900%! Just keep in mind that when a stock is trading at such a low price, it's really easy for it to go from $5.00/share to $10.00/share, a 100% gain. It's much harder for an already expensive stock to gain 100%. So, going from $5.00/share to $50.00/share isn't as crazy as the 900% makes it sound.

I'm worried that a lot of people will misinterpret this and think that their stocks really never will recover. As hard as it is to believe, it really is possible. Just be patient. If you've picked promising companies, there's a good chance that the future will be bright, if you're patient and take a multi-year view. That's how real wealth is built. Besides, even a single massive winner can more than eliminate any losses or underperformance from the losers.

**I Am Freaking Depressed (and Super Stressed)!**

I know. We *all* are.

So here's some advice. Just like the rest of us, you're only human. Life is full of reversals, and they're not all negative. The lows can feel really low, but the highs can be really high. Be patient. Things *will* break to the upside—way up! I know you don't believe that now. *No one* does. But it really is true. Life is a battle of faith against fear. You're the hero of your own life, and you're absolutely up to the task.

*Be that hero!*

The adversity that we're going through will make us wiser and stronger. We need to learn from it so that we can take advantage of future opportunities.

When you look at your portfolio, forget about the red. Give yourself permission and say to yourself: ""I'm going to start from where I am."" Let go of the past. You really are going to do well in the future. Don't give in to negativity. Faith—not blind faith, but belief grounded in trust that arises from historical research and data—has never been more important than in times like this.

Don't try to fight battles against depression, anxiety, and all the rest of the storms that affect our emotional lives on your own. Just being able to share how you feel with others in a similar boat is a big help sometimes. Having someone else's perspective can also help.

**Okay. So, What's The Endgame for the POWcycles?**

That's the zillion-dollar question.

How low will the POWcycles push share prices down? How long will it take for the market to form a base again? How quickly will it move up?

Every single one of us wants a massive rally on Monday, and every other day, for the next twenty years or so, and preferably for an entire lifetime. But the market cycle is bearish, so we need to learn to adapt what we do. The elite traders are mostly sitting in cash and waiting. You can (and should) follow them on Twitter and rely on them to tell us when the coast looks like it's clear. They know better than anyone. The most elite among them is Mark Minervini. (He also wrote some books that you should read.)

History may not repeat itself exactly, but it does echo. To me, it seems that 2008 was a lot worse than what we're seeing now. There were many suicides. I personally saw people who were about to retire from a company forced to cancel their retirement for *years*. It was a devastating time.

I don't know how much lower the growth stocks will drop, but I do know that they're the most vulnerable to inflation, and hence to the POWcycles. It's true that nothing is truly safe when it's insanely overvalued, revenue is declining or growth is slowing, and expenses are rising quickly (due to inflation). It's not just NVTA, SE, SNOW, and an extremely long list of other growth stocks that crashed so hard, but FB and NFLX, too. What you get with FB and NFLX is greater safety. They're not going to go bankrupt, and they'll probably recover to their all-time highs in time. The unproven growth stocks are risky, but so were FB and NFLX way back in the day.

Investing and trading are only possible by faith. But just because no one can know the future doesn't mean that we can't learn to make very strong bets.

What does history tell us about how the POWcycles will end?

A 30% drop in the Russell 2000 growth stocks (have a look at the ETF called IWO) that lasts six months is typical, but the combination of macroeconomic conditions that we're going through right now is unique. My own guess is that this will last for a while and involve a recession. We're about six months in, and my best guess is that we've got about two more years to go, so I think the market will be on solid ground again sometime in Q2 2024. (I don't know how much it might decline by then, or whether there could even be a full-blown crash.) This doesn't mean that IWO will retake its all-time high, only that it won't open a trap door underneath us, but be stable and give us a foundation that we can build on.

**What!? 2024!? I Can't Wait That Long!**

I know how you feel. We have finite lives. Unfortunately, we can't speed up the stock market machine. (It's just how stock market machines work.)

Remember: I could be wrong. Lots of people think that the market (SPY) will rally strongly and make a new all-time high in H2 2022. While I'm only guessing, I'm trying to be as realistic as I can so that I don't create expectations about what's possible that the stock market can't deliver. I hope that it does better than my guess, but it really is anyone's guess.

I don't think that things will move very quickly because the money supply is huge, and until it drops substantially, or our GDP grows into it, it'll continue to cause inflation to persist and will create a drag on stock market returns.

**What's the Deal With Inflation, the Fed, and a Recession?**

When The JPow raises interest rates, because borrowing money becomes more expensive for companies, they tend to spend less. Consumers save more and spend less. Corporate profits drop. Share prices drop. (Look at AMZN.) If this goes too far, it causes economic activity to contract, and two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth constitute a recession.

When he says that he's aiming for a soft landing, he's hoping to raise interest rates by just the right amount to tame inflation but prevent a recession. Recessions not only lead to reduced corporate spending. They lead to job losses and unemployment. The worst-case scenario would be high inflation and high unemployment (stagflation). The JPow is between a rock and a hard place. If he does too little, inflation will burn up our buying power. If he does too much, we might lose our jobs! (This is why people hate the Fed.)

**It Sounds Like Things Are Going to Get Even Worse!**

It looks that way, but for all we know, there could be a diplomatic ending to the war against Ukraine and the market could rally powerfully next month.

Try to separate things that you know that you can't control from those that you can. Notice how your mind tends to obsess over things that it can't change, and try to refocus it and remind yourself that your time is way too valuable to let your brain go into an infinite loop of worry about something that will resolve itself without your help (or worrying!). Go for a hike in nature. Often. If you play chess, hit me up and let's play on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org).

Whenever you worry about something that you can't change, you pay a debt that you don't owe.

Keep your money (and sanity), instead. Things really will be okay.

**Why Did You Write All of These Messages?**

I've been where you are. I get it. I worked hard to get an MBA and a few other degrees. I lived through the lockdowns, panic, insanity, market crash, mania, and depression of 2020-present. And I watched a huge number of YouTubers peddling courses and promising day trading success, pumping various memetic stocks, and teaching various trading methods that we all know don't work.

Please: Keep your hard-earned money.

Here's what I've learned over the years and decades.

* Building real wealth takes a few decades. Sure, a few TSLA boy-millionaires got lucky and won the equivalent of a lottery. How often do you hear about the others who lost their shirt?
* In strongly bullish conditions, you can make a killing with options trading if you study a lot and really learn how to protect yourself against risk.
* You can also make a lot of money with swing trading, but only in supportive market conditions, and even then, it's not as easy as it looks.
* Yes, you can trade full-time for a living, but you need enough capital to do it, as well as supportive market conditions. We'll have those again, but if I'm right, probably not for a couple of years. And when you make a killing, save $100k or $200k for when the bad times come, which they unfortunately (eventually) will. Hopefully we'll have a good ten-year run again.
* Read up on market cycles, and what you should and shouldn't do in any particular cycle.
* Institutions have so much data about us retail traders that it would take your breath away to see it. That's how they manage to trick us so easily.
* We can turn the odds against them, but that game isn't about drawing colored lines on a chart. It's about econometrics and descriptive and time series statistics.
* Yes, there are a rare few day traders with a freakish ability to make money (in the right market conditions), but the rest of us need ways of doing better than QQQ over the long haul that ordinary humans can actually pull off!
* Most importantly, yes, we *can* do better than QQQ over the long haul, but, wow. The learning curve is steep, it requires (a lot of) custom software development, and it's more than a full-time job. (It's also a lot of fun if you love investing and trading—or simply the art of financial warfare. :)  )

**Conclusion:**

If any of what I've said is helpful, and you'd like to hang out with our small learning community, be part of a supportive environment, get better together, and help one another, feel free to direct message me and I can send you a link.

We read. We talk. We make new friends. We watch videos and do research (form 10-Q and 10-K and all that jazz). We design and call out investments and trades. I try to remember what I was supposed to have learned when I was getting my MBA and help others to flatten their learning curve.

We don't sell anything. We don't cost anything. We just work together to help one another and have fun along the way.

Always remember: In the end, the only thing that matters is how you do versus QQQ. Year after year. Decade after decade. If you do well, the ultimate reward is a lot more important than mere money:

*Freedom*,

Introduction: 

Greetings again fellow crayon munching friends. I have decided that I will be doing one due diligence at least every two weeks. That being said, feel free to follow me or whatever if you want to make sure to see my short due diligences that are founded upon sleep deprivation, amateur investing knowledge, and way too many energy drinks. In the prior weeks I did Coinbase and Occidental Petroleum so feel free to check those out if you have not seen them. This week I will be conducting due diligence on Zoom. I think Zoom is and has been playing on house money for a while and I hope to give a decent picture of why through many munched paint chips and crayons. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reason 1: Zoom Financials

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0gb773316kz81.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=182b12d1cc3ed6533407a4f97cf2d341531cba44

Truthfully, at first glance Zoom’s financials appear pretty solid. Revenues, Net income, operating income, and gross profit all appear healthy, with solid growth the last few years. Revenue’s YoY growth for zoom is 55% from 2021-2022. Gross Profit’s YoY growth for zoom is 66% from 2021-2022. Operating income’s YoY growth is 61% for the same years and net income’s YoY growth is 105%. This appears to be explosive growth on Zoom’s part but I believe these numbers are misleading.

One reason is that despite the explosive YoY growth for the above financials, Zoom’s Operating Expenses for sales, general, and administrative expenses, also grew at 61% YoY. Simply put, how good is that 61% YoY growth for operating income given that sales, general, and administrative expenses grew by the same percentage YoY. I could certainly be wrong here but in my opinion, a company like Zoom should be able to post lower YoY growth for sales, general, and administrative expenses. It is Zoom after all, their business model involves far fewer physical assets and variable costs. Therefore, I am skeptical of this massive growth in sales, general, and administrative expenses, I do not think it bodes well for their long (or short) term business prospects. 

How does Zoom make money anyone may ask, after all I did not really know, so after a brief Google search using my hairy ape hands, I found out how. 

Essentially, all of Zoom’s cash flows come from subscription fees, hardware sales, advertising, and investments into other startups. This is important to note as I transition into my next point. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reason 2: Loss of market share

Zoom has made a killing financially by the stranglehold they had on the video conference market as the world was sent into a tailspin from COVID-19. However, this market dominance has dwindled as time has passed as Google Meets has taken over.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rdeyx4l46kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5b02bb136a5aafb0c14b3e9b1f9ec02d1a9a1f90

Google Meets currently has 2,747,358 total customers compared to Zoom’s 168,892. Google Meets has a market share of 84.82% of the total video conference market compared to Zoom’s paltry 5.21%. One thing that should be noted with these metrics (assuming they are accurate), is that they do not show the customer list themselves. For example, if Zoom manages to build strong customer relationships, and large companies with thousands of meetings a month choose Zoom over Google, it is okay for Zoom to have far less customers and therefore market share so long as they can keep them. However, I do not see why this would be the case. 

After all, pull out the orange crayon and take a bite, talk to your wife, your wife’s boyfriend, some random college kid on enough caffeine to kill a horse and ponder what could possibly cause such a thing. Nothing. The answer is nothing. Zoom’s success spawned from a video conference service that offered better ease of use, as well as high quality audio and video output. In the beginning this was lovely as everyone else, including Google, was late to the party. Unfortunately for Zoom though consumers have become more educated and are now flocking to the better products. On top of that more competitors have entered the market and Google Meets puts Zoom to shame. Zoom’s competitive advantage disappeared quicker than the fifth of whiskey in my hand watching the markets last week. Zoom will continue to lose market share to the superior product offered by Google as Google has more talent and money than Zoom. Google will continue to come out on top in this market and will crush Zoom’s share price in the process.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reason 3: COVID Caused Conferences are becoming less frequent

As time goes on and the world continues to emerge from the pandemic, the need for the very service Zoom provides will continue to decline. This tends to be a big deal when the entirety of Zoom’s cash flows come from subscription fees, hardware sales, advertising, as well as investments into startups. Nearly all of Zoom’s cash flows are tied to people using their platform. Cash flows are going to continue to decrease and this will spell disaster for Zoom’s financials in the future thereby crushing the stock price in the process. Personally, I go to a university that went full red coat, commie, CCP, North Korea on all of us students and even at my university we are now completely transitioning back to in person courses next semester. While my personal experience is not statistically significant and is by no means an end all be all predictor for this stuff, I do believe it matters when speaking to friends from other colleges who also are completely back in person full time. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reason 4: Earnings will be a disaster (May 23, after market close)

For all of the things listed above, I believe that earnings will be an abysmal shitshow. Like the first time we all were rejected by the girl of our dreams, Zoom shareholders are in for a ride on the pain train. The loss of market share from Google and the emergence of the global economies from the pandemic will cause earnings to miss by a wide margin, causing one of those glorious (for us gay bears) massive red dildos in after hours. Then we can sell our puts May 24th and make some easy money.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reason 5: ARKK is bullish on it

This is mostly a joke… mostly. Seriously though Cathie has 8.09% of ARKK in Zoom and that is good enough for me to dislike the stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6bvzpjva6kz81.png?width=299&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7085abe5961846b6cdba7576cba4f5929beee4b8

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reason 6: Cramer likes the stock.

I am going to repeat myself here. Cramer. Likes. The. Stock. This may be my strongest point. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q5tvpr2c6kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b9e58077fe13c0a2da115d6dbec834dfbfba39aa

Yes this article is from January 26, 2022, but as much of a joke as this is, Cramer really has been a solid leading indicator for what not to do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reason 7: Jerome Powell grows a pair

Seriously though, if Powell raises interest rates by 75 basis points (or more), the entirety of the stock market will take a massive shit. After all, look at what happened when the Fed announced a 50 bps increase that was already expected by the markets. We have been crushed in equity markets in the weeks since. Where does a high growth technology company like Zoom stand if this happens? I of course do not have the exact answer but I think it is worth noting that this is a possibility and a more likely one now given the horrid CPI data that still came in hotter than expected. Powell reiterated in a recent interview to Marketplace that half-point hikes are likely in June and July. This is not all that surprising but what is chilling to me is that he also stated “we’re prepared to do more if needed” in that same interview. That is ominous and clearly shows while it may be unlikely, higher than forecasted rate hikes are on the table. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wab087gd6kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d36d2b89734f4220b185893851556e5ff504d8bf

Source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/powell-reiterates-half-point-hikes-are-likely-in-june-and-july](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/powell-reiterates-half-point-hikes-are-likely-in-june-and-july)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Where I can be wrong:

1. It is entirely possible that the Fed does not raise rates in June and July which would create some serious headwinds for my bearish position.
2. Zoom creates or adapts their software in such a way that consumers transition back to it.
3. I am flat out wrong about earnings. Conversely, I am correct but it does not matter and for some god forsaken reason Zoom rips harder than a college kid on their dab pen.
4. The demand for Zoom conferences remains constant at its current place, or increases.
5. Any other incredible occurrence occurs, \*insert famous fuck here\* buys a 10% stake in Zoom, Covid variant sigma causes a shutdown for much of the economy, etc…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL; DR 

Zoom makes money from people utilizing their platform. As we emerge from COVID that need declines which will crush cash flows leading to a massive earnings miss on May 23rd. Cathie and Cramer like the stock. Powell raises rates (more than expected) causing a recession that makes Volcker’s rate increases and subsequent recession look like peanuts. All of this considered, Zoom share price will be curb stomped harder than me when I am just trying to enjoy a casual match of Warzone.

725,Upcoming Earnings for Consumer Categories - Who Next On The Chopping Block?,"I got bored at work so compiled a list of upcoming earnings with some quick stats:

In my honest opinion, I think if you are beating the indexes then you have just not dropped yet. Obviously this is a high level view and DDs are required on my part before buying puts but figured I would share. Every Ticker that is black in my opinion has the possibility of having significant drops.

727,"The question now is what, if any, stocks to buy that are down 60+%?","I watched a few minutes of CNBC today and the panel of people all were discussing a handful of stocks that are down 60, 70 or even 75% down from all time highs just within the past 24 months. Some of the names were: 

\- Upstart (UPST) - currently priced at $44/share was at $390 in October 2021 

\- Zoom (ZM) - currently priced at $89/share was at $559 in October 2020 

\- Carvana (CVNA) - currently priced at $33/share was at $370 in August 2021 

The list could continue but in general what stocks, if any, should people begin to pile into? I know Kevin O'Leary said it twice ""we have not hit bottom yet - if a person has $100 to invest in one of these stocks \[that has gone down a lot recently from all time high\] then buy $20 worth today and $20 worth in 30 days."" I would mostly agree. We have not hit bottom yet but I do feel the S&P 500 at or around 3800 is where the bottom is ***mostly*** at.",2022-05-20 21:49:44
728,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 23rd, 2022","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 23rd, 2022.

# **Stocks head for another potentially treacherous week, as a slew of retailers report earnings - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/20/stocks-head-for-another-potentially-treacherous-week-after-sp-500-falls-into-bear-market-territory.html)**
*****
> If there’s more bad news from retailers in the coming week, that could be a negative catalyst for an already cranky stock market.
*****
> Market pros are watching for more signs that stocks could be bottoming, though strategists say that is a tricky prospect and there could be false signals.
*****
> The S&P 500, on an intraday basis Friday, broke through its prior low to reach bear market levels - trading more than 20% below its record high reached in January. But it did not close there. Instead, it reversed the day’s steep losses and ended the day just slightly positive.
*****
> “It is a process. ... This week was scary in breaking through last week’s bottom. These things take time,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI.
*****
> Emanuel said that taking out the lows could signal a buying opportunity, and that the market is in a bottoming process. “Looking medium to longer term, toward the end of the year, we continue to see higher stock prices ahead,” he said.
*****
> Stocks were lower in the past week, despite the fact strategists had been expecting the oversold market to bounce. The market initially rallied, until earnings misses from Walmart and Target blew up the gains.
*****
> The surprising weakness in those two big stalwart retailers crushed their stocks, hammered the retail sector and took the entire market lower on fears the consumer is wobbling and other companies will also have earnings issues.
*****
> Earnings from Costco, Best Buy and others, as well as personal consumption expenditures data, could be important in the coming week as investors weigh how much the consumer is stumbling. The PCE includes data on spending, income and inflation.
*****
> The S&P 500 Friday dipped into bear market territory when it fell under 3,837.24, but did not close there. Some Wall Street pros consider it a bear market if a 20% decline is reached in an index on an intraday basis, but others insist the index must close at that level in order for the bear market to be effective.
*****
> Regardless, it’s the biggest downturn of this magnitude since the swift bear market decline in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.
*****
> “This is another step in the bottoming process, but we’re going to need follow through. You’re getting a slew of retailers reporting next week – the place that is under the largest microscope of investors, given the blowups we saw this week,” said Emanuel. “It will be absolutely vital for the broad market to respond in a positive fashion to whatever those retailers report.”
*****
> While there is no official determination on what a bear market is, strategists so agree that the extent of the bear market, or how far stocks could fall, depends strictly on the performance of the economy.
*****
> “The whole thing comes down to whether or not there’s going to be a recession. In the last three bear markets, where there was no recession, the decline was 21.3% and we’re basically there,” Emanuel said.In the last three bear markets when there as a recession, the average decline was 47.9%, he said. Those bear markets were in 2000, 2008 and 2020.
*****
> Other retailers reporting earnings in the coming week include Ulta Beauty, Macy’s, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and discounters Dollar Tree and Dollar General. Their reports and comments could help clarify whether the consumer is more broadly weakening, and how much inflation and supply chain snarls continue to hurt the stores and the economy.
*****
> “Any retailer reporting in this environment is a reason for an investor to be fearful, given what we’ve seen this week,” Emanuel said.
*****
> The reports from Walmart and Target came as the market was also assessing a very strong April retail sales report, showing spending jumped 8.2% year over year.
*****
> In the coming week, the economic calendar includes the Federal Reserve’s minutes from its last meeting on Wednesday, the second look at first quarter gross domestic product Thursday, as well as PCE data on Friday. The PCE data also includes the PCE inflation index, watched closely by the Fed.
*****
> “We’re likely to shift gears to focus on economic data. We get the April read on new home sales, which looks to be down but not as much as it was in April,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “We get durable goods, and that’s likely to show improvement as well. One thing that’s been consistent is the data and the economic calendar has been better than the market’s reaction to it.”
*****
> Stocks took a battering in the past week, with the S&P 500 down 3% to 3,901. The Nasdaq was bloodied even more, declining 3.8% as some big cap tech favorites cratered. Apple was down 6.4% on the week, and Tesla fell 13.7%.
*****
> Emanuel said investors should continue to stay defensive. “This is an environment where you have to look for all the edges you can, which is projected better earnings growth, depressed multiples and high short interest,” he said. When a stock has a high short position, meaning investors expect the price to fall, any move higher in price could force those investors to cover shorts, propelling the stock price to even better gains.
*****
> Emanuel said he also likes value names. “Long term, it’s a very very viable area of the market,” he said. Emanuel added that value stocks are under-owned by individuals, and he said the are a hedge in a rising rate environment and also against inflation.

> # SSmall Caps Best Week Before Memorial Day

> With market logging its 7th straight weekly loss in a row, prospects have dimmed for the usually quiet trading during the week before Memorial Day. In the Stock Trader’s Almanac, we show how the market trades around Memorial Day.

> In the table below we went back to 1971, the year the Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect, moving Memorial Day and most other federal holidays to Monday. In recent years, the Friday before Memorial has become getaway day on The Street and volume is often diminished and trading uninspired.

> DJIA is the weakest in the week before Memorial Day up 26 of the past 51 years and a paltry 0.01% average gain. S&P is a bit better, up 62.7% of the time with an average gain of 0.2%. NASDAQ is up 64.7% of the time, averaging a gain of 0.29%. But the Russell 2000 small caps take the lead ahead of the official kick-off to summer up 74.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.6%.

> But with the market getting hammered the last 7 weeks straight, NASDAQ already in bear market territory and S&P on the brink it is hard to get bullish on the market even for pre-holiday inspired trading. Our weekly losing streak study from last week does show a short pop across the board when these losing streaks end – but they have to end.

> # Stocks Below Pre-COVID Highs

> Last week, we outlined the percentage of stocks in each S&P 500 sector that had fallen below their pre-COVID highs to show that many of the stocks that surged due to pandemic effects have significantly fallen off, netting long-term holders a negative return since the onslaught of the pandemic. (Read it here.) Yesterday, the S&P 500 fell by over four percent to set a new 52 week low, breaking the 4,000 level. The index is still up over 15% relative to its pre-COVID high, but as of yesterday's close, 41.2% of S&P 500 members were below their respective pre-COVID highs, as 26 members crossed below this critical level yesterday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/pct.png))**

> Notably, six of the 32 S&P 500 consumer staples stocks crossed below, moving the percentage from 28.1% to 46.9% on the back of weak earnings reports from Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT). 66.7% of Communication Services stocks and 60.0% of Real Estate stocks in the S&P 500 are below their pre-COVID highs, but only 18.5% and 23.8% of Materials and Energy stocks are below this level, respectively. Additionally, 8.2% of S&P 500 members were within 5% of their pre-COVID highs, and 15.1% are within 10%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/Consumer-Staples-Stocks-below-pre-covid-highs-051822.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/SP-500-stocks-below-pre-covid-highs-051822.png))**

> Four S&P 500 stocks crossed below this critical level for the first time in a while yesterday: Cognizant Technology (CTSH), MGM Resorts (MGM), Tyler Tech (TYL) and Verisk Analytics (VRSK). This comes amidst weakness in the Technology sector (XLK) versus the broader S&P 500, as the sector is down close to 25% on a YTD basis versus the S&P 500's drawdown of about 18%. However, XLK is still up close to 30% relative to pre-COVID highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/Stocks-that-broke-pre-covid-highs-051822.png))**

> Additionally, there are three stocks that entered a 2% channel above their pre-COVID highs for the first time in a while. Dexcom (DXCM) entered the channel amidst weakness in the broader energy space, and Pentair (PNR) extended the downtrend that is yet to break. Walmart (WMT) sold off significantly in two consecutive days after a weak earnings report and is now less than 1% from its pre-COVID high. A month ago WMT was 30% above this level.

> # Post-COVID Gains for Small-Cap Growth Go Poof!

> Growth stocks outperformed value stocks by a wide margin in the years leading up to the pandemic. Growth also outperformed value in the first ~18 months after the pandemic, but that trend has been flipped on its head since late 2021. You can see the recent convergence between growth and value in the chart below. Entering 2022, the S&P 500 Growth index was outperforming the S&P 500 Value index by ~40 percentage points since the pre-COVID high for the stock market in February 2020. Now, Growth is only outperforming Value by ~8 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/spxgv.png))**

> The shift from growth to value has been even more dramatic in the more economically sensitive small-cap space. Remarkably, the Russell 2,000 Growth index is now DOWN 6% on a total return basis since the pre-COVID peak for stocks on 2/19/20. Six months ago, this index was still up 45% from its pre-COVID high.

> Fed Chair Powell first shifted to a tighter monetary stance in November 2021. In just six months since Powell's pivot, we've seen the entire post-COVID bull market for small-caps give up its gains and then some. And this doesn't even factor in a double-digit percentage point increase in inflation since COVID began that pushes ""real"" returns for the Russell 2,000 Growth index much deeper into negative territory.

> # Retail Roiled

> Reactions to the biggest retailer earnings have generally been abysmal this season. Today, Target (TGT) is following in the footsteps of Walmart (WMT) with its worst single-day reaction to earnings on record according to the data in our Earnings Explorer and its worst day overall since the 1987 crash. Given the two are some of the largest publically traded retailers, broad measures of the space are plummeting. As shown below, the VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) is down nearly 7% which puts it on pace for its third-worst day since it began trading in 2011. The only two worse days were in March 2020. Similarly, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT)—which has both a longer history and a different weighting methodology (equal-weighted)—is down an even more dramatic 8.73% as of this writing. That is on pace to be the seventh-worst day on record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/051822-Retail.png))**

> Of course, there are many different niches in the retail space meaning some areas have held up better than others. Below we show the relative strength lines since the start of 2020 for various S&P 1500 retail sub-industry indices versus the broad market (S&P 1500). The charts are sorted from left to right and top to bottom by largest to smallest market caps.

> By far the most striking decline has been the General Merchandise Stores industry which includes names like Walmart and Target. That line essentially shows the group has lost any and all outperformance versus the broader market since the spring of 2020. The relative strength line of specialty stores has also fallen dramatically to the lowest level in over a year. While those brick-and-mortar giants have gotten crushed, the same can be said for internet-based retail, but the drop in this industry actually happened ahead of these others.

> Within retail, there are also a couple of pockets that have held up well. For example, Home Improvement Retail is comprised of stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), and that line is still roughly in its uptrend of the past month and the same goes for Automotive retail in spite of its pullback. The only one making a considerable move higher today is apparel retail. However, the entirety of that move is thanks to TJX Companies (TJX) which is the only stock of the 19 in the industry that is trading higher on the day; TJX is rallying 7.87% on earnings.

> # Six Things To Know About Bear Markets

> It has been a historically bad year so far for stocks, with many names in bear markets. Thus far though, the S&P 500 Index has avoided a bear market (classified as a 20% decline from recent highs), as it was down 18.1% as of last week.

> Here are six things to know regarding bear markets.

> 1) There have been 17 bear (or near bear markets) since World War II. The average drop was nearly 30% and lasted nearly a full year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-chart-1.png))**

> 2) Breaking down bear markets with recessions and without recessions shows an interesting development. Should the economy be in a recession, the bear markets get worse, down 34.8% on average and lasting nearly 15 months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-3.png))**

> 3) Whereas as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, should the economy avoid a recession, the bear market bottoms at 23.8% and lasts just over seven months on average. Even more interesting is we’ve seen multiple near bear markets bottom near 19%, close to where stocks bottomed last week.

> “Going back more than 50 years shows that only once was there a bear market without a recession that lost more than 20% and that was during the Crash of 1987,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “With other near bear markets without a recession bottoming near 19% corrections in 1978, 1998, 2011, and 2018, not far from the recent lows.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Blog-3.png))**

> 4) Midterm years can be quite volatile with the average year down 17.1% peak to trough, so a bear market during this year isn’t out of the ordinary. Knowing that helps put this year’s drop of 18.1% in perspective. The good news is a year off those lows, the S&P 500 has gained 32.0% on average, something most investors would likely take right about now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Blog-5.png))**

> 5) Here are the fastest bear markets ever. Not surprisingly, the pandemic related bear market of March 2020 was the fastest ever, going from a new high to down 20% in only 16 trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Blog-5-1.png))**

> 6) This is the third year of the current bull market and the third year tends to see somewhat muted returns, up barely 5% on average. In fact, there have been 11 bull markets since World War II and three of them ended during their third year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-6.jpg))**

> So those are six things to know about bear markets. Lastly, speaking of six, the S&P 500 is down six weeks in a row currently, the longest losing streak since 2011. It hasn’t been down seven in a row since 2001. What stands out about this data is if the six week losing streak is down more than 10% (like this one was), then the future returns can be quite strong. Up a median of 9.9% six months later and 29.2% a year later.

> # Expect More May Market Volatility

> May has delivered much more than its usual market volatility. Stocks rallied strongly out of the blocks. NASDAQ jumped 3.2% on the third trading day, May 4, up 5.1% for the month. Then the bottom fell out. NASDAQ dropped 12.3% over the next five trading days. Bargain hunting came in over the past four days rallying NASDAQ 5.5%. In the chart here we have put 2022 on the right scale to highlight the trend since the moves in May 2022 have been about 10x the historical average. As you can see despite the increased volatility this year stocks have tracked the typical May Seasonal Trend rather closely. The market is still negative for the month. But if the trend continues the market has a good shot to turn positive for May. But many support levels have been broken and this appears to be a bear market rally.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/045bd47bc823bad0aa2e632e12a9c808/8f7660130f34c11d-c8/s500x750/0f4ec34a440873c91f071ad28b9a8e4f32390dd0.jpg))**

> # Homebuilders Sentiment Free Fall

> Although material cost pressures have shown some signs of alleviating (for example lumber and copper futures have been grinding lower), the cost to finance a home has only increased with the national average of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hovering around 5.5%. That higher cost dampens demand, and homebuilder sentiment has taken a sharp turn lower. The NAHB's Housing Market Index fell from a top 5% reading of 77 last month all the way down to a new 52-week low of 69 this month. The index has been rolling over for some time now after peaking all the way back in November 2020, and the 8 point month over month decline in May is the worst of that span, ranking as the fourth largest monthly decline in the history of the index. Two of those larger declines came in the midst of recessions/major economic shocks—October 2001 (9/11) and April 2020 (start of the pandemic). The other largest drop was in February 2014.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/051722-NAHB1.png))**

> The big drop in the headline index points to a notable deterioration in reported conditions and similar drops were shared across the sub-indices. Present sales remain the most elevated with its reading of 78 managing to stay in the top decile of its historical range, but just barely so as the 8-point m/m decline also ranks as one of the largest on record. Even though reported sales are holding up decently (albeit far from improving), sentiment for future sales has collapsed. After a double-digit decline this month, the index is below its historical median meaning homebuilders are anticipating activity to slowdown in the coming months. One likely reason is that overall traffic has pulled back sharply. The 9-point month-over-month drop is tied for the second-largest decline on record.

> From a geographic standpoint, this month was interesting. As with the national indices, the Midwest and West saw some of the sharpest activity pullbacks in the history of the survey. Those indices are now around similar levels to the spring of 2020. For the South, the decline did not result in an outright collapse below the post-pandemic range, but nonetheless, the decline was enormous by historic standards.

> Then there's the Northeast. While the rest of the country experienced sharp pullbacks, the Northeast index actually rose by 2 points to 76. Although the level remains middling versus its post-pandemic range, it is a notable divergence compared to the rest of the country.

> In spite of the report on homebuilder sentiment, homebuilder stocks, as proxied by the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), are actually higher alongside the rest of the market, currently up 1.3%. Those gains on top of the past few days' rally appear more technical in nature than any sort of improvement in the overall backdrop for the space. As shown below, the group has been hit hard this year as mortgage rates have soared. Hardly at any point this year has the group managed to trade above its moving averages.

732,"Zoom earnings beat expectations, stock soars 18% after hours - is this the start of the tech rebound?","(edit: Should have specified ""is this the start of an enterprise software/SAAS rebound?"" Thank you for all who mentioned SNAP but a failing social media platform is a bit different from a company with billions in revenue and 200K customers)

Zoom earnings beat expectations, stock soars 18% after hours


Video conferencing giant Zoom (ZM) reported quarterly earnings on Monday, beating analysts' expectations and revising its full-year guidance. Shares of the company soared as high as 18% in after-hours trading, after getting pounded this year.

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting in the quarter, as compiled by Bloomberg.

Revenue: $1.07 billion versus $1.07 billion expected

Adjusted EPS: $1.03 versus $0.87 expected

Customers paying more than $100K in last 12 months: 2,916 versus 2,958 expected

Zoom revised its full year adjusted earnings per share to between $3.70 and $3.77 from $3.45 to $3.51. Zoom also reported that it now has approximately 198,800 enterprise customers, up 24% year-over-year.

Shares of Zoom were up more than 18% after the report.",2022-05-23 17:11:44
733,ZM earnings are half of last year. Misses forecast. Stock shoots up and gains 10%,"Zoom Video Communications reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $113.6 million, compared with $227.4 million in net income a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected net income of $115.1 million.


So Zoom stock is zooming because they launched a Zoom Contact and Whiteboard and Zoom Wendy's livestreaming or some other fucking bullshit like that.

Their guidance is ""Strong"". They expect to make around Jillion dollar next year probably because they have factored in monkeypox pandemic. At this point their ceo might as well start having raw buttsecks with wsb members to spread the virus and turn the guidance into reality.

*****

# [Stock futures indicate the sell-off resuming on Wall Street after Monday’s brief rebound](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures fell early Tuesday morning as the markets struggled to sustain a comeback rally following weeks of losses.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 202 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures dipped 1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.7%.
*****
> Snap shares plummeted more than 31% after the company said it’s bracing to miss earnings and revenue targets in the current quarter and warned of a hiring slowdown. Shares of Meta Platforms followed Snap lower, falling 7% in the premarket, while Pinterest lost 14%.
*****
> “Stocks are getting hit hard this morning and the main culprit is the Snap warning from Monday evening,” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge. “Some are a bit incredulous that a relatively small and perennially unprofitable ephemeral social media firm can take down the whole tape, but given how sensitive this tape is, SNAP is able to punch above its weight.”
*****
> “Tech still dominates the market, both numerically (it remains the biggest weighting) and psychologically, and despite aggressive liquidation in the last couple of months, people still own a lot of it,” he added.
*****
> Shares of major tech companies reliant on advertising spend followed Snap lower. Alphabet slid 4%. Amazon fell 2% and Apple and Netflix were each down more than 1%.
*****
> “We expect all online ad platforms to feel some impact of a significant consumer pullback,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts after the Snap warning. “Advertising is cyclical.”
*****
> Meanwhile, Zoom Video shares popped 6% after the company issued strong guidance for the second quarter.
*****
> Retail earnings continue this week and investors are eager to see how high inflation is affecting consumer demand, and if last week’s disappointments from big box retailers were company specific or reflections of the whole sector.
*****
> On Tuesday shares of apparel maker Abercrombie & Fitch dropped 10% premarket after reporting that freight and product costs weighed on sales for the fiscal first quarter. Best Buy shares initially popped after the company reported a mixed quarter, but reversed, and last traded 2% lower. Retailers were among the top gainers in the S&P 500 Monday.
*****
> The moves came a day after the market staged a rebound from last week’s steep market sell-off, which saw the Dow hit its first eight-week losing streak since 1923, and the S&P 500 briefly fall into bear market territory on an intraday basis.
*****
> Stocks rallied during Monday’s regular trading session as the Dow jumped 618 points, or nearly 2%, following a week of sharp losses. The S&P 500 rose 1.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%. The moves left investors wondering whether the bounce can hold or if it was yet another minor relief rally amid the relentless sell-off that has yet to reach a bottom.
*****
> “This kind of environment where you’ve got the whipsaw and ups and downs that are so big is a trading environment where it can feel on any given day like you were wrong yesterday and that is ripe for mistakes,” Sofi’s head of investment strategy Liz Young told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> Investors are looking ahead to new home sales and a speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development summit on Tuesday. Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren are also slated to report earnings.

# [Stock futures indicate the sell-off resuming on Wall Street after Monday’s brief rebound](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures fell early Tuesday morning as the markets struggled to sustain a comeback rally following weeks of losses.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 202 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures dipped 1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.7%.
*****
> Snap shares plummeted more than 31% after the company said it’s bracing to miss earnings and revenue targets in the current quarter and warned of a hiring slowdown. Shares of Meta Platforms followed Snap lower, falling 7% in the premarket, while Pinterest lost 14%.
*****
> “Stocks are getting hit hard this morning and the main culprit is the Snap warning from Monday evening,” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge. “Some are a bit incredulous that a relatively small and perennially unprofitable ephemeral social media firm can take down the whole tape, but given how sensitive this tape is, SNAP is able to punch above its weight.”
*****
> “Tech still dominates the market, both numerically (it remains the biggest weighting) and psychologically, and despite aggressive liquidation in the last couple of months, people still own a lot of it,” he added.
*****
> Shares of major tech companies reliant on advertising spend followed Snap lower. Alphabet slid 4%. Amazon fell 2% and Apple and Netflix were each down more than 1%.
*****
> “We expect all online ad platforms to feel some impact of a significant consumer pullback,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts after the Snap warning. “Advertising is cyclical.”
*****
> Meanwhile, Zoom Video shares popped 6% after the company issued strong guidance for the second quarter.
*****
> Retail earnings continue this week and investors are eager to see how high inflation is affecting consumer demand, and if last week’s disappointments from big box retailers were company specific or reflections of the whole sector.
*****
> On Tuesday shares of apparel maker Abercrombie & Fitch dropped 10% premarket after reporting that freight and product costs weighed on sales for the fiscal first quarter. Best Buy shares initially popped after the company reported a mixed quarter, but reversed, and last traded 2% lower. Retailers were among the top gainers in the S&P 500 Monday.
*****
> The moves came a day after the market staged a rebound from last week’s steep market sell-off, which saw the Dow hit its first eight-week losing streak since 1923, and the S&P 500 briefly fall into bear market territory on an intraday basis.
*****
> Stocks rallied during Monday’s regular trading session as the Dow jumped 618 points, or nearly 2%, following a week of sharp losses. The S&P 500 rose 1.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%. The moves left investors wondering whether the bounce can hold or if it was yet another minor relief rally amid the relentless sell-off that has yet to reach a bottom.
*****
> “This kind of environment where you’ve got the whipsaw and ups and downs that are so big is a trading environment where it can feel on any given day like you were wrong yesterday and that is ripe for mistakes,” Sofi’s head of investment strategy Liz Young told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> Investors are looking ahead to new home sales and a speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development summit on Tuesday. Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren are also slated to report earnings.

*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose slightly Thursday, as Wall Street tried to rebound from a long string of weekly declines.
*****
> Dow futures rose 141 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 climbed 0.6%. Nasdaq advanced 0.3%.
*****
> The Dow has fallen the last eight weeks, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are riding seven-week losing streaks.
*****
> However, the market seems to have somewhat regained its footing this week, as investors hope inflation is starting to peak and that there’s good value to be found at these levels. The Dow and S&P 500 are up 2.75% and 2%, respectively, for the week. The Nasdaq is also up 0.7%.
*****
> The Dow has also posted gains in the last four sessions.

Similarly, software stock Snowflake tumbled 14% after the company’s guidance for operating margin came in narrower than expected.
*****
> Though first-quarter earnings for the market as a whole have been largely in line with historical trends, there have been dramatic pullbacks for some major stocks after earnings reports as investors look for the impact of inflation and slowing economic growth.
*****

738,Spotlight on a 2x Leveraged ETF FNGG-Holdings are Worth Taking a Look At,"FNGG is a 2x leveraged ETF that gives you the advantage of taking out margin on your broker without actually taking out margin, and it accurately tracks the price of some very interesting holdings with 2x the volatility.  I think we hit the market bottom so I am personally all in on FNGG.  What is interesting are the holdings:

I like this Leveraged ETF because of the following:

I would never buy shares of Google, Nvidia or Amazon with other high growth stocks being beaten down so far, but all three companies are having stock splits that are bringing their share prices for Google, Amazon under $150 and NVDA will be under $50!  The rest of the holdings are quality high growth stocks.

At the high FNGG was $33.50, this is a 82.5% drop.  If ATH is reached, that's a rise of 500%, and the best part is you don't need to pick sketchy stocks or put all your money into one stock to make a 5x gain.  All you need to count is the QQQ will go back to ATH sometime in the future, and that means so will FNGG.

According to ARK’s open-source research and model, Zoom’s share price could approach $1,500, compounding at a 76% annual growth rate, in 2026.
Tuned to the 75th and 25th percentile Monte Carlo outcomes, our bull and bear cases are $2,000 and $700 per share, respectively, as shown below.[2]




https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/arks-zoom-model/",2022-06-09 17:25:45
740,"Cathie Wood sees 13x surge in Zoom ($ZM) by 2026, targets $1,500 stock price, panning mandates to end remote working as ‘trial-and-error’","Shares in video conferencing mainstay Zoom Communications could surge more than tenfold in price over the next four years as skilled employees working from home successfully resist management efforts to herd them back into the office.

Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest published on Wednesday its thesis for Zoom, the top holding in its flagship Innovation exchange-traded fund (ETF), complete with a $1,500 price target for 2026 and a minimum of $700 should its bearish scenario unfold. 

“We believe current pivots back to in-office mandates could be part of a trial-and-error process for employees that will increase the percent of workers in hybrid/remote working models during the next five years,” ARK wrote. 

Interestingly, the sentiment expressed effectively repudiates the management style of another major conviction call in ARK’s portfolio: electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla. 

Critics including corporate executives have called CEO Elon Musk’s demands for workers to return to their desks for a minimum 40 hours a week with virtually no exception “tone-deaf” in the current environment.

ARK Invest instead seems to share the views of Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who described his $28 billion acquisition of Slack last month as a bet that remote work is not going anywhere.

“Knowledge worker backlash and talent shortages will compel employers to adopt more flexible arrangements,” ARK Invest argued. “Slack reports that employees forced to return to the office full-time experienced the steepest declines in work-life balance and overall satisfaction compared to their hybrid/remote peers, suggesting that in-office mandates will lead to high rates of attrition.”

ARK said it expects the total number of addressable knowledge workers excluding China to hit 832 million in 2026, of which 75% will engage in some form of flexible labor arrangement, up from 489 million and 51% last year.

Under its bull case, Wood’s money management firm even foresaw the share rising to $2,000 over the same period, compared to the $115.46 closing price from Wednesday.

As Russia inches towards victory there is talks of sending tactical nuclear weapons to Ukraine which is likely to escalate into a Thermonuclear war.

RGC: CEO Figuratively Putting His Money Where His Mouth Is

By [Beth Senko, CFA](https://scr.zacks.com/analyst-bios/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=b8877843-0e4b-47b2-895e-10adc4acf236)

NASDAQ:RGC

Investors have faced challenging and volatile markets so far in 2022 as they sort through issues of inflation, supply chain disruption, continued covid issues, rising interest rates, and the disruption of the war in Ukraine. The S&P 500 has come close to bear market levels, down 19% in mid-June.

Times of turbulence affect all stocks, large and small. It can be particularly challenging for pre-revenue microcap stocks, where the volatility is often magnified by small changes in perception, whether driven by news or technical trading signals.

We first wrote on Regencell Bioscience (NASDAQ:RGC) and its preliminary trials for ASD/ADHD, in [November 2021](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2021/RGC-Traditional-Chinese-Medicine-Approach-for-treatment-of-neurodevelopmental-conditions/default.aspx). At that time, the stock was trading around $20/share. It rose to $40 by mid-February 2022, before dropping back to the low 20s in early April.

While the overall markets continue to be weak, RGC’s share price has performed well since April. Shares have since recovered to the high-$30s to $40. In our view, RGC’s recent share price recovery stems from encouraging study results for Regencell’s RGC-COV19TM Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula for treating COVID-19 symptoms, frequent shareholder communication, and support for the shares in the market.

 

***Management’s commitment to meet Regencell’s strategic goals***

Founded in 2014, Hong Kong-based Regencell Bioscience is an early clinical stage bioscience company using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach to develop standardized TCM formulas to holistically treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, and infectious diseases which affects the immune system such as COVID-19.

The formulae candidates aim to address the fundamental causes of disorders while alleviating symptoms and improving overall health at the same time. Taking a holistic approach, RGC’s TCM uses natural ingredients to treat different elements in the body and every bodily function is taken into consideration when preparing the TCM formulae for patients.

Unlike some early-stage companies, where it can be difficult to parse the many ways in which founders and executives may benefit whether or not the company succeeds, RGC has taken a more transparent approach that is well-aligned with shareholders’ long-term interests.

• **Chairman and CEO support.** Since RGC’s incorporation in October 2014 up to the IPO, the Company has been fully funded by its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yat-Gai Au.

◦ Upon the IPO, the Chairman’s loan of USD $3.25 million, was converted into \~342,000 common shares at the initial offering price of USD $9.50.

◦ Pledged to not draw salary and bonus of more than USD $1 until the Company reaches USD $1 billion market capitalization;

◦ Will not award share options for himself;

◦ Since the IPO, RGC’s Chairman and CEO has purchased over USD $5 million in common shares on the open market. Most recently, he purchased [49,010 shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001829667/000121390022026630/ea160018-13da4regen_regen.htm) (\~ USD $1.1 million) between April 1 and May 16, 2022, bringing his ownership to 81% of outstanding shares (\~10.5 million).

• **Billionaire investor backing.** Samuel Chen, a successful early Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) investor is one of the major backers of RGC. Last reported 13G filing shows he holds a 7.63% stake in the company.

• **Stock option lock-up extended.** All directors and employees who were previously granted stock options upon the Company’s IPO have agreed to a further lock-up undertaking for a period of six months after their stock options become vested. As their stock options are set to vest on July 16, 2022, their shares will remain locked up until January 16, 2023.

• **Royalties.** Under the agreement with their strategic partner and TCM practitioner, Mr. Sik-Kee Au, creator of the original TCM formulae that form the basis of RGC’s intellectual property, RGC will pay 3% of net revenue, which will in turn be donated to charitable institutions/trusts at the choice of the TCM Practitioner.

***Recent news and upcoming catalysts***

On May 18, 2022, RGC announced a follow-on study of its investigational liquid formula RGC-COV19TM in the elimination for COVID-19 symptoms ([EARTH-B Trial](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2022/RGC-Second-investigational-study-of-RGC-COV19-replicates-results-of-earlier-trial-in-eliminating-COVID-19-symptoms.-/default.aspx)). The follow-on study built on the promising results reported in the first EARTH trial ([EARTH-A Trial](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2022/RGC-Regencell-Bioscience---Investigational-Liquid-Formula-RGC-COV19-shows-promise-in-eliminating-COVID-19-symptoms/default.aspx)), conducted in 2020-2021. Across the two trials, 95.5% of subjects (n=81), reported complete symptom alleviation within six days following treatment, (except for loss or reduce of sense of smell and/or taste (Sensory Dysfunction) or occasional cough).

In the next few months, RGC expects to report data from its second clinical study of its standardized TCM formula for the treatment of ASD and ADHD.

Regencell Bioscience’s first clinical trial was designed to establish benchmarks for treatment, dosing, adverse effects (AEs) and measuring patient response in a systematic and repeatable way. The study, conducted in 2018-2019, included seven adolescents, aged five to eleven, with professionally-diagnosed ASD or ADHD. After discontinuing any current therapies and medication, subjects received a customized version of the TCM formula for up to three months. Patients’ responses were measured through parental interviews and four validated assessment instruments including the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS), Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale (VADRS) and Pelham (SNAP)-IV 26-item Parent Rating Scale (SNAP-IV-26). All seven patients showed a lessening of symptoms during the treatment period across all four scales.

The second clinical study evaluates response to three standardized mixtures of the TCM formula (for mild, moderate and severe impairment) on children in the same age group. The study design calls for twice daily dosing for three to 12 months, weekly practitioner meetings and monthly assessments. The results will be used to file for proprietary Chinese medicine (pCm) registration in Hong Kong making the product available to for sale in other clinics as well as over the counter.

Regencell is focused on its clinical studies in order to corroborate its results. These efforts will lead to the building of manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure required to gain pCm registration. Regencell Bioscience has a four-year timeframe to commercialize its standardized formulations and gain pCm registration in Hong Kong. The Company has a number of tasks ahead:

• Completing its second clinical trial and evaluating results.

• Conducting additional clinical trials to support its proprietary formulae in ASD/ADHD and other applications.

• Obtaining patents and other forms of IP protection in Hong Kong and other markets.

• Establishing manufacturing capability and supply chain that will meet registration requirements.

• Assembling and filing documentation for pCm approval.

• Build out its marketing and distribution strategy and infrastructure.

RGC’s steady share price ascension in recent weeks may be a sign of greater things to come as its moves towards commercialization, we are encouraged by its thoughtful, systematic approach to developing its therapies, and communicating its progress to shareholders.

**Market Recap** 

Stocks pushed higher Wednesday after a very choppy session following the release of the Federal Reserve’s June meeting minutes, which highlighted the risk presented by elevated inflation and a commitment by the Fed to remain aggressive in its fight against higher prices. The price of crude oil remained under $100 per barrel amid fears that a recession would weigh on demand while the benchmark 10-year treasury yield fell to 2.82%, the lowest level in six weeks.

Prospects of a deep economic downturn have stoked ongoing volatility in markets, with investors weighing whether inflation and a more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening cycle will curb growth to the point of tipping the economy into a recession. And some key economic data, from consumer sentiment to spending and purchasing managers' indices, have each softened or turned lower in recent prints.

After trading choppily all morning, stocks pushed higher in the afternoon after the release of the Fed’s meeting minutes, which reaffirmed the Fed’s commitment to aggressively fighting inflation. The minutes said, “Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy. and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist.""

Moreover, the Fed all but confirmed another 75 basis point hike to the interest rate in the next FOMC meeting. The minutes said, “After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings.”

Early on Wednesday, new data painted a mixed picture on the current state of the economy. [Job openings](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm) came in greater-than-expected at nearly 11.3 million for May, pointing to persistent tightness in the labor market and ongoing labor scarcities relative to vacancies. Separately, the [Institute for Supply Management's closely watched services index](https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-report-on-business/services/june/) dipped to the lowest level since May 2020 as of June.

Jonathan Miller, senior analyst at Barclays, said “A broad-based slowdown in overall consumer spending has already been underway this year, led by deterioration in the goods category, with services providing little in the way of offset. may indicate that a more precautionary mindset might be setting in, which would make households more inclined to hoard excess savings accumulated during the pandemic.""

749,There are 3 major signs inflation may have peaked — but they don't mean things are going to get cheaper right away By Ben Winck," 

* Several signs suggest inflation has peaked, and will continue gradually cooling from the pace seen earlier in 2022.
* The trend, known as disinflation, means prices will still broadly rise, just at a slower pace.
* While some costs are set to drop, a prolonged decline would hint at an entirely new problem.

The US could very well be past the worst of its inflation problem. But don't expect things to get cheaper.  


For much of the past two years, the pace of price increases has been accelerating. Headline inflation now sits at an [**8.6% year-over-year pace**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9pbmZsYXRpb24tcmVwb3J0LWNwaS1tYXktZ2FzLXByaWNlcy1mZWRlcmFsLXJlc2VydmUtcmF0ZS1oaWtlcy0yMDIyLTY_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBab6202f6/email), marking the fastest rate since 1981.  


Yet recent data suggests that surge [**could be turning over**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9pbmZsYXRpb24tb3V0bG9vay1wY2UtbWF5LXBlYWtlZC1nYXMtcHJpY2VzLWZvb2QtbGlmdGluZy1jb3N0cy0yMDIyLTY_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBf958e16c/email). Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has decelerated for three straight months, according to the [**Personal Consumption Expenditures**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVhLmdvdi9uZXdzLzIwMjIvcGVyc29uYWwtaW5jb21lLWFuZC1vdXRsYXlzLWFwcmlsLTIwMjI_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBaf05e519/email) price index. Month-over-month price growth is also down from the levels seen early in the year.  


📷  


But even though inflation looks like it might be cooling off, don't expect things to get much cheaper.  


To understand the path of inflation, one has to wrap their head around a key distinction. Inflation tracks the pace at which prices grow, not actual price levels. The cooldown seen over the past few months means that prices are still climbing, just at a slower pace.  


The current decline is a perfect example of disinflation. The term describes inflation that's still positive but weaker than before, and it's exactly what the [**Federal Reserve**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlL3doYXQtaXMtdGhlLWZlZGVyYWwtcmVzZXJ2ZT91dG1fY29udGVudD1JbnNpZGVyX0ZlYXR1cmVkX0FydGljbGU/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBdcfbccea/email) and the Biden administration want to see.  


Contrary to what many Americans probably believe, some inflation is good. It symbolizes a healthy amount of consumer demand and, more broadly, sustainable economic growth. The Fed has long targeted a one-year inflation rate of about 2%. That level is, according to the central bank, the best for balancing maximum employment and price stability. Allowing for higher inflation would conflict with the Fed's price-stability goal, and a lower target would likely foster a less inclusive labor market.  


Many Americans likely want to see prices drop for some time after the past year's price surge. Yet a prolonged period of falling prices would make for an entirely different crisis. Such a trend, also known as deflation, can kickstart a vicious cycle for the entire economy.  


Businesses tend to slow production when prices fall in order to protect their margins. That usually leads to layoffs and weaker pay growth. If the trend lasts long enough, widespread joblessness can lower demand and pull prices lower still. Deflation is a surefire sign of a weak economy and can quickly pull a country into a downturn similar to the Great [**Depression**](https://link.insider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZ3VpZGVzL2hlYWx0aC9tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoL3doYXQtaXMtZGVwcmVzc2lvbj91dG1fY29udGVudD1JbnNpZGVyX0ZlYXR1cmVkX0FydGljbGU/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB6db5e4b7/email).  


For now, it looks like the economy is experiencing disinflation, not deflation. Some prices have fallen in recent weeks, but a brief decline among a limited set of goods and services isn't enough to sound the deflation alarms.  


Here are three reasons why that trend of disinflation is likely to continue for the rest of 2022.  


**(1) The biggest inflation drivers are weakening**  


Much of the latest inflation surge comes down to commodity prices, specifically food and energy commodities. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions on the Kremlin [**slammed the global supply of several key goods**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS1pbmZsYXRpb24tbGlmdGluZy1wcmljZXMtYW1lcmljYW4tc2hvcHBlcnMtZ2FzLXdoZWF0LW5pY2tlbC0yMDIyLTM_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB355b72f7/email) including crude oil, wheat, natural gas, fertilizer, and nickel. That drove prices sharply higher throughout the first months of 2022 and exacerbated inflation that was already running at multi-decade highs.  


That trend has reversed course in recent weeks. The S&P GSCI — a popular benchmark for global commodity prices — is down nearly 23% from the record high posted in early June. [**Crude oil futures**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYXJrZXRzLmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvb2lsLXByaWNlP3R5cGU9d3RpJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PUluc2lkZXJfRmVhdHVyZWRfQXJ0aWNsZQ/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB15b94d42/email) have similarly plunged, and prices for food commodities like [**wheat**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYXJrZXRzLmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvd2hlYXQtcHJpY2U_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB23dd2914/email), [**corn**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYXJrZXRzLmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvY29ybi1wcmljZT91dG1fY29udGVudD1JbnNpZGVyX0ZlYXR1cmVkX0FydGljbGU/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB6a8cc759/email), and [**soybeans**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYXJrZXRzLmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvc295YmVhbnMtcHJpY2U_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB1c0bffc8/email) are also off of their early summer highs.  


The declines are already offering Americans some relief. The average price of a gallon of gasoline slid to $4.78 on Wednesday, according to [**AAA**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9nYXNwcmljZXMuYWFhLmNvbS8_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB78fb6e6f/email), down from the mid-June record of just over $5. About 80% of gas stations are back to selling regular-grade fuel for less than $5 a gallon, Andrew Gross, a AAA spokesperson, said in a Tuesday [**release**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9nYXNwcmljZXMuYWFhLmNvbS93aWxsLWdhcy1kZW1hbmQta2VlcC1mYWxsaW5nLW9yLWlzLXRoZXJlLWEtdS10dXJuLWFoZWFkLz91dG1fY29udGVudD1JbnNpZGVyX0ZlYXR1cmVkX0FydGljbGU/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB35daa625/email).  


**(2) Supply chains are healing**  


The supply chain snags that emerged in 2021 played a major role in pushing inflation to historic highs. Solving the tangle of port backlogs and shipping delays could cool price growth, and some indicators signal the situation is improving.  


For one, shipping rates are almost half of what they were at the height of the logistics mess in the fall. [**The Freightos Baltic Index**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYnguZnJlaWdodG9zLmNvbS8_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB36b5fd5d/email), which calculates the average price of shipping a 40-foot container of goods, fell to $6,577 in the week that ended July 1. That's down from $11,109 in September, and the decline has accelerated in recent months. The downtrend suggests kinks in the supply chain are being worked out, and as shipping costs fall, there will be less pressure on companies to boost prices.  


**(3) Companies are moving from price hikes to discounts**  


Easing inflationary pressures are an encouraging sign, but it takes time for that to translate to slower price growth at gas stations, grocery stores, and retailers. Commentary from several companies hints that shift is taking place right now.  


In a first-quarter earnings call on June 29, Bed Bath & Beyond CFO Gustavo Arnal indicated the company will ""work aggressively"" to clear excess inventory that the company has built up, according to a transcript created by [**Sentieo**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWFwcC5zZW50aWVvLmNvbS8_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB20c530da/email). The clearance will all but certainly come with many price cuts as the company looks to trim its stock.  


Bed Bath & Beyond is far from the only company pivoting from inventory build-up to huge sales. Walmart executive John Furner told investors in June that it could take ""maybe a couple of quarters"" to clear out unwanted inventory. Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette told [**The Wall Street Journal**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tYWN5cy1nYXAtYW5kLW90aGVyLWNsb3RoaW5nLXN0b3Jlcy1hcmUtc3R1Y2std2l0aC10aGUtd3JvbmctaXRlbXMtMTE2NTQ0MjE0MDE_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) in late May that inventory boomed faster than expected, and that markdowns will weigh on profits as the department store chain clears some supply.

750,RGC: CEO Figuratively Putting His Money Where His Mouth Is," 

By [Beth Senko, CFA](https://scr.zacks.com/analyst-bios/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=b8877843-0e4b-47b2-895e-10adc4acf236)

NASDAQ:RGC

Investors have faced challenging and volatile markets so far in 2022 as they sort through issues of inflation, supply chain disruption, continued covid issues, rising interest rates, and the disruption of the war in Ukraine. The S&P 500 has come close to bear market levels, down 19% in mid-June.

Times of turbulence affect all stocks, large and small. It can be particularly challenging for pre-revenue microcap stocks, where the volatility is often magnified by small changes in perception, whether driven by news or technical trading signals.

We first wrote on Regencell Bioscience (NASDAQ:RGC) and its preliminary trials for ASD/ADHD, in [November 2021](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2021/RGC-Traditional-Chinese-Medicine-Approach-for-treatment-of-neurodevelopmental-conditions/default.aspx). At that time, the stock was trading around $20/share. It rose to $40 by mid-February 2022, before dropping back to the low 20s in early April.

While the overall markets continue to be weak, RGC’s share price has performed well since April. Shares have since recovered to the high-$30s to $40. In our view, RGC’s recent share price recovery stems from encouraging study results for Regencell’s RGC-COV19TM Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula for treating COVID-19 symptoms, frequent shareholder communication, and support for the shares in the market.

Taking a holistic approach, RGC’s TCM uses natural ingredients to treat different elements in the body and every bodily function is taken into consideration when preparing the TCM formulae for patients.

Unlike some early-stage companies, where it can be difficult to parse the many ways in which founders and executives may benefit whether or not the company succeeds, RGC has taken a more transparent approach that is well-aligned with shareholders’ long-term interests.

• **Chairman and CEO support.** Since RGC’s incorporation in October 2014 up to the IPO, the Company has been fully funded by its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yat-Gai Au.

◦ Upon the IPO, the Chairman’s loan of USD $3.25 million, was converted into \~342,000 common shares at the initial offering price of USD $9.50.

◦ Pledged to not draw salary and bonus of more than USD $1 until the Company reaches USD $1 billion market capitalization;

◦ Will not award share options for himself;

◦ Since the IPO, RGC’s Chairman and CEO has purchased over USD $5 million in common shares on the open market. Most recently, he purchased [49,010 shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001829667/000121390022026630/ea160018-13da4regen_regen.htm) (\~ USD $1.1 million) between April 1 and May 16, 2022, bringing his ownership to 81% of outstanding shares (\~10.5 million).

• **Billionaire investor backing.** Samuel Chen, a successful early Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) investor is one of the major backers of RGC. Last reported 13G filing shows he holds a 7.63% stake in the company.

• **Stock option lock-up extended.** All directors and employees who were previously granted stock options upon the Company’s IPO have agreed to a further lock-up undertaking for a period of six months after their stock options become vested. As their stock options are set to vest on July 16, 2022, their shares will remain locked up until January 16, 2023.

• **Royalties.** Under the agreement with their strategic partner and TCM practitioner, Mr. Sik-Kee Au, creator of the original TCM formulae that form the basis of RGC’s intellectual property, RGC will pay 3% of net revenue, which will in turn be donated to charitable institutions/trusts at the choice of the TCM Practitioner.

***Recent news and upcoming catalysts***

On May 18, 2022, RGC announced a follow-on study of its investigational liquid formula RGC-COV19TM in the elimination for COVID-19 symptoms ([EARTH-B Trial](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2022/RGC-Second-investigational-study-of-RGC-COV19-replicates-results-of-earlier-trial-in-eliminating-COVID-19-symptoms.-/default.aspx)). The follow-on study built on the promising results reported in the first EARTH trial ([EARTH-A Trial](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2022/RGC-Regencell-Bioscience---Investigational-Liquid-Formula-RGC-COV19-shows-promise-in-eliminating-COVID-19-symptoms/default.aspx)), conducted in 2020-2021. Across the two trials, 95.5% of subjects (n=81), reported complete symptom alleviation within six days following treatment, (except for loss or reduce of sense of smell and/or taste (Sensory Dysfunction) or occasional cough).

In the next few months, RGC expects to report data from its second clinical study of its standardized TCM formula for the treatment of ASD and ADHD.

Regencell Bioscience’s first clinical trial was designed to establish benchmarks for treatment, dosing, adverse effects (AEs) and measuring patient response in a systematic and repeatable way. The study, conducted in 2018-2019, included seven adolescents, aged five to eleven, with professionally-diagnosed ASD or ADHD. After discontinuing any current therapies and medication, subjects received a customized version of the TCM formula for up to three months. Patients’ responses were measured through parental interviews and four validated assessment instruments including the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS), Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale (VADRS) and Pelham (SNAP)-IV 26-item Parent Rating Scale (SNAP-IV-26). All seven patients showed a lessening of symptoms during the treatment period across all four scales.

The second clinical study evaluates response to three standardized mixtures of the TCM formula (for mild, moderate and severe impairment) on children in the same age group. The study design calls for twice daily dosing for three to 12 months, weekly practitioner meetings and monthly assessments. The results will be used to file for proprietary Chinese medicine (pCm) registration in Hong Kong making the product available to for sale in other clinics as well as over the counter.

Regencell is focused on its clinical studies in order to corroborate its results. These efforts will lead to the building of manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure required to gain pCm registration. Regencell Bioscience has a four-year timeframe to commercialize its standardized formulations and gain pCm registration in Hong Kong. The Company has a number of tasks ahead:

• Completing its second clinical trial and evaluating results.

• Conducting additional clinical trials to support its proprietary formulae in ASD/ADHD and other applications.

• Obtaining patents and other forms of IP protection in Hong Kong and other markets.

• Establishing manufacturing capability and supply chain that will meet registration requirements.

• Assembling and filing documentation for pCm approval.

• Build out its marketing and distribution strategy and infrastructure.

RGC’s steady share price ascension in recent weeks may be a sign of greater things to come as its moves towards commercialization, we are encouraged by its thoughtful, systematic approach to developing its therapies, and communicating its progress to shareholders.

**Market Summary**

Stocks finished modestly lower in a choppy session as investors digested the latest consumer price index (CPI) numbers, which showed inflation has continued to accelerate from already elevated levels to over 9% year-over-year. Treasury yields were also in focus, with sharp moves happening at the front end of the yield curve. The 10-year rose as high as 3.04% following the CPI print before retreating, with 2-year yields rising as much as 3.17%, prompting a further inversion. The yield curve “inverts” when yields on shorter-dated Treasuries rise above those of longer-dated ones and have [typically preceded recessions on Wall Street](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yield-curve-inverts-april-2022-200829124.html).

Meanwhile in currency markets, the euro fell below parity — or a 1:1 value — with the dollar early Wednesday, the first time in over twenty years. 

In the US, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed headline inflation rose a whooping 9.1% year-over-year, another drastic acceleration from the already-elevated 8.6% reported last month and higher than estimates of 8.8%. “Core” CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components, rose 5.9% in June, compared to 6.0% in May. Economists expected a 5.7% increase in this measure.

These figures confirm another 75 basis point hike to the interest rate at the conclusion of the July 27 policy meeting, with some even speculating the Fed may be forced to consider a dramatic 100 basis point hike. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said “Overall, this report confirms that the Fed will need to hike by 75bp again at the end-July meeting. While some will draw parallels with the shockingly bad May CPI report, the backdrop is markedly different — commodity prices have fallen sharply and we’ve seen clearer signs of an economic slowdown, both of which will contribute to weaker price pressures ahead.""

In addition to the CPI print, market participants digested the start of a new earnings season. 

Delta Air Lines ([DAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAL/)) [reported earnings that missed expectations on Wednesday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-q2-earnings-airlines-massive-surge-travel-105709221.html) morning as higher costs bit the airline currently battling with excess demand and constrained capacity. Shares of Delta fell 4.7%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) are among the big banks to follow suit Thursday and Friday.

**Highlights**

* Notorious short-seller Hindenburg Research said it had taken up a long position on Twitter shares. ""We have accumulated a significant long position in shares of Twitter. Twitter's complaint poses a credible threat to Musk's empire,"" Hindenburg said in a tweet.
* Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman told investors Monday he would return $4 billion raised by the SPAC he launched in 2020.
* Peloton will stop making its own equipment as the company pivots focus from selling hardware to selling subscriptions. Taiwanese company Rexon Industrial will become the primary manufacturer of the bikes. 
* Kathaleen McCormick will oversee Twitter’s (TWTR) lawsuit against Tesla CEO Elon Musk after he pulled out of the deal to acquire the social media company for $44 billion.
* Netflix (NFLX) announced Microsoft (MSFT) as its partner ofr its ads-supported service, which the company will employ following last quarter’s disastrous results. 
* Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Day sales generated $6 billion in sales, up 7.8% from last year, making it the biggest U.S. online shopping day of 2022 so far.

754,The DD on Monkeypox and how you can profit off it. The bull case for Siga Technologies and Bavarian Nordic,"A lot of folks here on WSB and other places have been making light of the global monkeypox outbreak, but as the months have gone by it has gotten progressively worse. [Those who scoff at monkeypox could in fact be scoffing at a quick ticket to a lambo and a yacht.](https://youtu.be/0H4a_lHANYI?t=11) The disease is rapidly spreading to new countries and in places like [New York City demand for vaccine is so high that clinics typically run out within minutes of announcing availability.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/thousands-of-new-york-city-monkeypox-vaccine-appointments-filled-in-just-7-minutes/ar-AAZDIYM) The global epidemic has gotten bad enough that the[World Health Organization is meeting today to decide whether or not to declare monkeypox a “global heath emergency.](https://www.ksby.com/news/national/who-emergency-committee-meets-considers-declaring-monkeypox-a-global-emergency)” As with any crisis, disaster or pandemic there are those who stand to profit from the chaos. So the natural question us here at WSB will ask is, just how can I make money of monkeypox. The answer lies with Bavarian Nordic, that makes monkeypox vaccine, and SIGA Therapeutics that makes the only effective anti-viral treatment for monkeypox.

**So just what is Monkeypox?**

[Monkeypox is in the Orthopoxvirus family and is closely related to smallpox, cowpox, horsepox, camelpox and vaccina virus. Monkeypox, like all orthodox viruses, spreads through close contact with infected persons and the pustules that form on the skin of those infected.](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/index.html)Smallpox was the deadliest o[f the orthopox viruses. It had two subtypes, 1. variola major, the most common type, had a deathrate of 30% and 2. variola minor, which had a deathrate of about 1%.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox) Similarly, monkeypox also has two variants, the Congo basin variant has a death rate of about 10%, and the West African variant has a death rate of about 1%. The West African variant is the type that has now spread across the globe and infecting people worldwide. [While outside of a minor outbreak in the US Midwest (important for reasons we will get into) in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Midwest_monkeypox_outbreak) and some isolated cases, monkeypox was not known to spread outside of Africa until the current outbreak. However, it is entirely possible that some cases of monkeypox many decades ago had been mistaken for weak variola minor cases. Most of the other orthopox virus are much milder than smallpox or monkeypox, but all cases of orthopox can be disfiguring leaving scars, hence the “pox”, leaving literal pock marks on the skin after infection. Monkey pox is spread through contact with an infected person or through contact with infected rodents. T[he 2003 outbreak was spread through contact with pet Gambian pouched rats, very different from today’s epidemic which is spread through close person to person contact. Given that animals can spread the disease, even in the event it is eventually suppressed in humans in a particular area, if a local animal population becomes infected that could provide a new reservoir for the disease.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4627722/)Since monkeypox is already endemic in large swaths of Africa, its stands to reason that even if the current epidemic subsides, that additional monkeypox outbreaks will occur in the future globally without widespread vaccination.

**So how can I profit off of it?**

As I mentioned above, there are two primary pharmaceutical products that stand to profit from the expanding global monkeypox epidemic:

**1.** **SIGA Technologies (NASDAQ: SIGA)**

Amazingly, even though monkeypox was not a widespread disease of global concern until recently, there is in fact an anti-viral drug on the market that is effective at treating monkeypox (and other orthopox viruses). This is Siga Technology’s Tpoxx antiviral drug. Its sales have soared as the monkeypox outbreak has worsened, since it is practically the only effective treatment for monkeypox. [The result is that as monkeypox spreads to new areas, countries have no choice but to place orders for more and more of Siga’s Tpoxx drug, with Siga racking up tens of millions of dollars in orders.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-siga-gets-28-mln-205157571.html)However, Tpoxx’s applications actually go beyond monkeypox. [Siga just signed a deal with KaliVir Immunotherapeutic to use Tpoxx as part of a cancer treatment. KaliVir’s cancer treatment uses vaccina virus to target and destroy cancer cells](https://apnews.com/press-release/globe-newswire/covid-technology-health-tumors-ac92bf71bc71782cfa64caf9cb77dd4f). Since Tpoxx appears to work against all Orthopox viruses, including vaccina virus, its use can moderate the effects of the vaccina virus injections given with the cancer treatments. Siga’s Tpoxx drug was also designed to be effective against smallpox, [and countries were originally interested in it to protect against any bio-weapon attacks using smallpox.](https://www.army-technology.com/news/cdnd-meridian-purchase-oral-tpoxx/) In fact, Siga’s development of Tpoxx was subsidized by the government specifically for use in the instance of biological warfare involving smallpox. A benefit to this is that Siga has lower R&D costs associated with Tpoxx due to the subsidies, and therefore reaps in higher profits on each new order. Siga Technologies is actively traded on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol SIGA (and yes, there are options available). Since Tpoxx is the only treatment, if the monkeypox outbreak continues to get worse SIGA will reap in the profits. Of couse, if the outbreak subsides, the demand for SIGA’s drug will slacken, but the opportunity for its uses outside of treating monkeypox, such as in KaliVir’s cancer treatment, will potentially still be there. SIGA reports its quarterly earnings in early August.

**2.** **Bavarian Nordic (NASDAQ Copenhagen: BAVA)**

In addition to TPOXX there are also vaccines that have been approved by the FDA and the EU that are effective against Monkeypox, however Bavarian Nordic’s Jynneos vaccine is by far the most popular and useful on the market for reasons that we will get into. [Similar to how Tpoxx is seemingly effective against multiple orthopox viruses, most smallpox vaccines are also effective against multiple other orthopox viruses. Generally, infection with one type of orthopox virus provides protection against the others. The first vaccine ever created was simply cowpox virus (also an orthopox virus) deliberately given to people in the late 1700’s to protect them against smallpox. Since the deathrate for cowpox is very low, people would survive the cowpox and be protected against smallpox. Most modern smallpox vaccines use vaccina virus, which has a death rate that is infinitesimally small (mostly just severely immunocompromised people). However, vaccina virus does have side effects since it is a live virus. Most notably it causes a scar at the injection site, but it can occasionally cause mild illness in otherwise people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine)For smallpox vaccination purposes, this is perfectly acceptable, because of the absurdly high deathrate and disfigurement smallpox caused. However, this also meant that the smallpox vaccines that had been on the market could not be used for immunocompromised people.

[As a result, the company Bavarian Nordic (BAVA on the Nasdaq Copenhagen), obtained government subsidies to develop its Jynneos vaccine, which is made from a severely weakened non-replicating (attenuated) version of the vaccina virus. Again the government's interest in aiding the development of Jynneos was spurred by concerns of a bioattack with smallpox.](https://www.newsobserver.com/herald-sun/durham-news/local-news/article263253968.html) Interestingly enough, before the monkeypox outbreak even occurred, Jynneos was specifically also approved for use to prevent monkeypox, while other smallpox vaccines are not (even though they are also generally effective at preventing same). Since Jynneos’s vaccine does not have the nasty side effects that traditional smallpox vaccines do, is specifically approved to prevent monkeypox and is safe for immunocompromised people, Bavarian Nordic has been receiving millions and millions of orders from across the world for is Jynneos vaccine. On July 1, 2022, the US federal government ordered an [additional 2.5 million more vaccine doses from Bavarian Nordic.](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-orders-another-25-mln-doses-bavarian-nordics-monkeypox-vaccine-2022-07-15/)Despite the orders,[clinics offering the vaccine are routinely running out of vaccine doses, most notably in New York City where the virus is spreading rapidly.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/monkeypox-treatments-are-hard-to-get-despite-us-stockpile/ar-AAZMnMs) Bavarian Nordic reports is [earnings on August 24.](https://stockdetect.com/stock/CPH/BAVA/earnings)

**So what about the future outlook?**

The more monkeypox spreads, the better business will get for both Siga and Bavarian Nordic. [Once smallpox was eradicated in 1979, countries generally stopped vaccinating their citizens for smallpox.](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/49/4/489/47117/THE-END-OF-ROUTINE-SMALLPOX-VACCINATION-IN-THE?redirectedFrom=fulltext) The result is that most of the population today is unvaccinated against smallpox, and therefore susceptible to all orthopox viruses, including monkeypox. In the US, the only people who had been vaccinated the past few decades [had been soldiers participating in the invasions of Iraq (where it was feared Saddam Hussein would use smallpox as a weapon)](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/opinion/IHT-germ-warfare-vaccinate-against-smallpox-before-attacking-iraq.html)and certain researchers and medical personnel. Since most of the population is unvaccinated against monkeypox, in the event monkeypox becomes permanently established (aka “endemic”) within the population of any particular country, that country will have to start routinely ordering Jynneos vaccine and Tpoxx to prevent and treat the infections. In the event countries want to vaccinate their entire population and attempt to wipe out monkeypox, like they did smallpox, literally billions of doses of Jynneos vaccine will need to be ordered to vaccine most of the earth. The result of course is utterly insane profits for Royal Bavarian and SIGA. Even in the event the current epidemic is ended, the prospect of another international monkeypox outbreak will always be present and therefore countries will continue to order and keep on hand does of Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine. Amazingly enough, even though Bavarian Nordic keeps racking up orders from across the globe,[it is still currently trading at 20% less than its 52 week high of 369 DKK in August of last year.](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/BAVA.CO#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-)

*****
> Stock futures fell Tuesday morning as tensions between the U.S. and China increased ahead of an expected visit to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were 166 points lower, or 0.52%. S&P 500 futures slid 0.60%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.77%. Shares of Caterpillar are weighing on Dow futures after the company reported earnings that missed revenue expectations, sending the stock down more than 3% before the bell.
*****
> Pelosi was expected to visit Taiwan and spend Tuesday night there, Reuters reported, citing sources. Leading up to the trip, Chinese officials threatened to take action if Pelosi moved forward with the visit. Pelosi would become the first House Speaker since Newt Gingrich in 1997 to visit Taiwan.
*****
> “We would like to tell the United States once again that China is standing by, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army will never sit idly by, and China will take resolute responses and strong countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a daily briefing Monday.
*****
> Traders are also awaiting another raft of earnings from companies such as Starbucks, PayPal and Advanced Micro Devices.
*****
> Tuesday’s moves came after the major averages fell on the first day of August. The S&P 500 shed 0.28% to end at 4,118.63 while the Nasdaq Composite inched 0.18% lower and closed at 12,368.98. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 46.73 points, or 0.14%, to end at 32,798.40. Last month, the major averages posted their biggest one-month gains since 2020.
*****
> “I think for sure it remains a bear market bounce,” Kevin Simpson of Capital Wealth Planning told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Monday. ”... I think it was awesome the way the markets traded in July, but I think we’re not through any type of capitulation. The headwinds are just too rampant.
*****
> On the economic data front, investors this week are awaiting the July nonfarm payrolls report slated for release Friday for further clues into the state of the economy and the job market.

# The Technicals

2022's first half was the worst half to a stock market year in the last 52 years. This saw the S&P 500 move down from 4,818.62 to 3,636.87. This is a range of 1,181.75. Of this range, an ideal fibonacci retracement (bear market short-term rally) would be 61.8% back up in this range. That takes us 730.32 up from 3,636.87 which gives 4,367.19. Yesterday's high was 4,325.28. This high was within 1% error of the ideal 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.

Thus, the 50 Week Simple Moving Average of the S&P500, as a further catalyst for resistance, will reject the S&P500 down, thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue.

That said, the first half of 2022 was the worst in 52 years, the third quarter was one of the best, and the fourth quarter may end up being the worst stock market quarter on record. Here is a visual:

# 1929-crash-like Margin Deleveraging

[FINRA Margin Statistics](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) has been updated to include July. As expected, we got a slight reprieve in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. Nevertheless, graphing the data and adjusting for the near-record inflation for each data point, we can see that we are still in the worst bubble by value in the history of the stock market.

Fibonacci of this graph shows that Margin has to collapse up to $370 Billion more from August's expected margin value), depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging.

FINRA Margin Totals, Adjusted for Month-by-Month Inflation. Dotcom crash (left bubble), 2008-2009 crash and great recession (middle bubble) and the current bubble (right). Fibonacci retracement values are listed for 61.8% and 78.6% of each deleveraging period. One can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range, depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding. (61.8% seems to correspond to slow and weak, and 78.6% seems to correspond to fast and strong). The data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

Unfortunately, summer is ending. The short-term rally has expired, as technicals show three problems for the stock market: 1: A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 50 week Simple Moving Average, 2. The 61.8% retracement already happened, and 3. A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 200 day Simple Moving Average. In a 1929-like scenario, total margin (and adjusted for inflation) shows that we are still in the largest margin bubble of all time. Fibonacci levels on the inflation-adjusted FINRA margin data show that the market has to still undergo up to $370 Billion of deleveraging. Therefore, I am hereby predicting that the fall and winter months of 2022 will be some of the worst months in stock market history. Leading market strategists such as Dimon, Zuckerberg, Musk, Novogratz, and even Warren Buffett concur, and some say that 2023 will be a Depression. Will 2022's crash lead us into 'the greatest depression,' and do you think Warren Buffett will die \[either because of or\] during this crash/depression?

760,A Story,"\*Skip to \*\*\*\*\* to avoid historical intro\*

Despite the title of this post, I'm a fucking retard and don't know the first thing about telling stories. But due to recent events, a spark has ignited in my ape heart to share this tale with those of you who may find it one that is enjoyable, laughable, nostalgic, or dare I say another crayon to add to your 24-pack to replace the one you chewed on all day today. This post will contain my own story as well as media from the time period it takes place.

Though this may be my first post on WSB, I have been here for a few years. I do not claim to be a veteran or historian. I discovered this sub at the beginning of COVID. I was sent home from college, told in 2 weeks we'd return to finish the semester, only to later graduate from home and online. 

At times I've watched you retards from afar, losing hundreds of thousands on ridiculous 0DTE SPY calls and puts. I laughed along with the majority of the community at the ""loss porn"" though this was not all I'd witnessed. I saw you fuckers making mad money long before Jim Cramer on $TSLA, $NIO, $PLUG, $PLTN, $ZM, and many others. A healthy influx of tendies was bringing attention to this community of helmet-wearing degenerates. You all certainly caught mine, and I decided to join.

I soon began my first real job in May of 2020. I also began my first investment account. I worked in the engineering field. With a decent wage, booming economy / stock market, and being incapable of spelling the word ""inflation"", I soon began making sweet gains off of everything I'd invested in. In the first 5 months I'd turn $15k into around $32k. Rookies numbers by the book of WSB, and fairly so. I rode beginner's luck to the end of the rainbow, where I would soon find King Crayola himself, DFV.

Now we all know the way this story ends, and so you may wonder why I use the Lord's name in vain. But in the beginning, there was no light. There was tinfoil. There was disbelief. There was Wendy's applications being DM'd (probably). AND... there was conviction. Stronger than any man's I'd seen. DFV's calls were an unstoppable force, his shares immovable objects, his hands made of DIAMOND. No matter what anyone commented, he knew what he was doing. What he did not know, was the quite literal GLOBAL phenemenon (can one of you fuckers tell me how to spell this word) that was about to begin.

\*\*\*\*\* Here is where my WSB story begins.

[Half man half ape](https://preview.redd.it/jcjkvts5rki91.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a546acd3ef2d6a6595282b162ec8b4304ed67aff)

Before they were referred to as ""meme stocks"" they were just tickers that were booming. $GME had made a ""steady"" but explosive run from around $4 to just under $40. A 1000% increase fueled by what... a float short of 141% if I remember correctly? And despite what any of you may say, this was the core. DFV's bet on $GME was that the shorts would get burnt, that the amount of shares shorted was over the amount even available. In WSB terms, shorts r fuk. And once WSB as a forum opened their ape brains to this idea, it was like archduke franz ferdinand had just been assassinated. A world war was brewing between the untied nation of retardation and Melvin fucking Capital. And many, many others would join the war soon.

As I sat at my desk job having just thrown my entire investment account into $GME, I'd officially gone full retard. Literally, I couldn't fucking get shit done at work to save my life. I'd just seen about half my year's salary in unrealized gains in a couple hours. I was an excited and anxious mess, glued to my phone like peanut butter flavored weed to snoop dogg's tongue. And so the rollercoaster of emotions had started.

I'd seen $80k turn back to $38k in TWO HOURS. I am 23 bro. What the fuck is going on?! I make it through the day of work having accomplished shit piss and lunchtime. I spend my night reading WSB posts, when I see this comment:

I decide that I will need some time away from work, so I take the week off. During this time we find many new allies joining our cause. Elon Musk, some billionaire indian investor, Dave fucking Portnoy who turned out to be a paper-handed bitch, AOC before the feet pics, and idk do you guys remember that weird Nordic guy on twitter? Kjetill Stjerne? He was there for a minute too. Enemies like Citadel, CNBC, Robinhood... those fuckers... they all rose and fought back as dirty as they could via media and even DISABLING THE BUY BUTTON. Never ever forget that. This is back when Ryan Cohen wasn't the main character btw.

And thus, through the power of people tapping their thumbs on their phones, to the tune of sea shanties and the Tendy Man (a WSB fucking banger), war cry meme videos of 300 Spartans, some LOTR posts where Gandalf says some inspirational shit to Bilbo Fuckbag, and actual billboards of $GME go BRRRR lmfao... it actually did.

Now there was a lot... A LOT that happened between these 4 pics. I watched myself lose over $100,000 in 10 minutes. Thegoatbro felt like thedumbfuckhobo. But in the end, we made some money. Which for WSB, is a pretty big accomplishment at times. Even given that fact, I had been defeated. My exit plan was thrown out the window, and to that I had blamed the WSB echo-chamber of ""HOLD THE LINE"" for a long time, though I do know it is my own fault. It hurt in every way possible to accept the mistake I'd made with $GME, but I accept it nonetheless. I have learned a lot about myself through this experience, and a lot about who I believe we are should we choose to follow or participate in this sub.

We are individuals. We are investors, whether we describe ourselves as that or not. Ryan Cohen made the best move for himself this week, and no one can fault him for that. We are retarded. Very retarded. We are apes, and apes together strong. We are not investment advice. We are not financial advisors. We are charitable, some of us heroes even, with the tendies we rarely walk away with. We are real people not actors. We are a casino and a Wendy's. We are the Tendy Man my friends. We are the rocketships to the moon, the printers that go brrrr.

Through the losses, the wins, the memes and the occasional suicide hotline post... we choose to play the game. And we just don't know when to stop.",2022-08-18 22:42:16

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 22nd, 2022.

# **Stocks fall Friday to notch weekly loss, S&P 500 snaps 4-week-long rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
> Stocks tumbled on Friday as Wall Street’s summer rally faltered and rate hike fears resurfaced, leading the major averages to end the week on a sour note.
*****
> The S&P 500 slid 1.29% to close at 4,228.48, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 292.30 points, or 0.86%, to 33,706.74. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01% to settle at 12,705.22.
*****
> For the week, the S&P edged 1.21% lower, while the Dow slipped 0.16%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed out the week down 2.62%.
*****
> Friday’s halt in Wall Street’s summer rally came as minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting and comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard indicated that the central bank would likely continue hiking rates in the near term, putting a damper on investors’ hopes of a slowdown.
*****
> Despite the week’s moves, many investors and traders are holding out hope for a bounce back.
*****
> “I wouldn’t expect a complete reversal going back to the June lows or something like that, however, the choppiness we’re seeing today and this week does reflect a lot of the bear case that’s out there,” said FBB Capital Partners’ Mike Bailey. “I think seeing the market trade sideways or seeing a bit of a pause in that rally definitely makes sense based on some of the facts that we’re seeing out there.”
*****
> Meanwhile, Bed Bath & Beyond shares cratered more than 40% after Ryan Cohen dumped his entire stake in the retailer. The move seemed to dampen sentiment among meme stock traders who have bet big on the company in recent months.
*****
> In other news, about a $2 trillion notional value worth of options contracts expired on Friday. Options expirations can add volatility to markets as some holders may be forced to move into their positions.

> # September Almanac: Only 4 NASDAQ Wins in Last 12 Midterm Septembers

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ae0526fdc81e4647a92654fd01bafc40/ea931548fa046435-aa/s500x750/edd7a611bfd1e3a45544584d8d198310a4e18b80.jpg))**

> Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. Although September’s overall rank improves modestly in midterm years going back to 1950, average losses widen for DJIA (–0.8%), NASDAQ (–0.8%), Russell 1000 (–1.0%) and Russell 2000 (–0.8%). S&P 500’s average September loss improves slightly from –0.5% to –0.4% in midterm years. Although September 2002 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA has declined in 11 of the last 18 midterm-year Septembers.

> # Total Return vs Price Change Spreads

> As we mentioned in today's Chart of the Day, there can be a wide spread between total returns and price change based on dividend yield. Although it doesn't always make financial sense for a company to pay dividends, they can certainly magnify returns all else equal. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

> The table below outlines twenty S&P 500 stocks that have seen a high percentage of their returns over the last twenty years come from dividends. The average stock on this list has seen over 80% of their gains over the last two decades come from dividends alone. Although the average stock on this list has only seen a price gain of 61.1% since August of 2002, their average total return when factoring in dividends re-invested has been 278%.

> # Bulls Set a New High

> Bullish sentiment continued its recent run of increases according to the weekly AAII individual investor sentiment survey. Hitting 33.3% this week, bulls are at the highest level since the last week of 2021. That 2022 is nearly 2/3 complete and we still haven't seen a bullish reading over 33.3% tells you how negative investors have been this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-1.png))**

> Bears also ticked up this week reaching 37.2% versus 36.7% last week. While bearish sentiment has only been below 40% for three weeks in a row, that is the longest stretch of sub-40% readings since the start of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-2.png))**

> With more bears than bulls once again this week, the bull-bear spread has now been negative for 20 straight weeks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-5.png))**

> With both bulls and bears higher, neutral sentiment was the only reading to fall this week. Neutral sentiment dropped 1.7 percentage points from 31.2% down to 29.5%. That was only the lowest reading in four weeks as neutral sentiment sits the closest to its historical average of 31.4%.

> # 10-Day A/D Line Overbought for 15 Days

> In an earlier tweet, we pointed out the elevated readings across 10-day advance decline lines in our Sector Snapshot. Not only is the 10-Day A/D line for the S&P 500 approaching one-year highs (as of yesterday's close), but it has been ""overbought"" for the last 15 trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-10-day.png))**

> Going back to the start of our data in 1990, there have only been eight other times in which the S&P 500's 10-day A/D line has been overbought for 15 days in a row or more. The last time such a steak was observed was at the start of 2019 which ended at 22 days. That tied for the March 2016 streak for the longest on record back to 1990. We would also note that other than one streak in the first couple of months of 1991, nearly all of these long streaks with an overbought 10-day A/D line occurred since 2010. In other words, consistently impressive breadth by this measure has largely been a recent phenomenon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Streak1.png))**

> This is not the only impressive breadth signal we have covered of late. For example, in yesterday's Chart of the Day we highlighted that more than 90% of S&P 500 stocks were above their 50-DMAs. Prior times when we've seen that reading spike above 90% have been followed by strong returns in the months and year ahead. Looking at the past times in which the 10-day advance decline line has been overbought for 15 days in a row, forward performance of the S&P 500 has not been considerably stronger than the norm. From that 15th day, the S&P has risen half the time one week out. One and three month returns are more consistently positive but weaker than the norm on a median basis. In the year after the long overbought A/D streaks listed below, though, the S&P was higher 7 of 8 times for an average gain of 11.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Table.png))**

> Below is a chart of the S&P 500 since its 2009 Financial Crisis low. As shown, most of these overbought A/D line streaks have occurred as the index was recovering from some sort of sell off. Only one of them (in early 2018) came about at the time of a notable peak in the index.

> # Moving Averages Putting Up a Fight

> Just as the S&P 500 ran into some resistance yesterday at its 200-day moving average (DMA), we've seen the same pattern play out in a number of commodities. Two of the more high-profile ones have been copper and crude oil.

> Copper fell out of bed in the late spring and early summer, losing a third of its value. Along with the equity market, copper has seen a late-summer rally, but things came to a screeching halt right at the 50-DMA last Thursday. Copper has been down on two of the last three trading days and hasn't been able to trade back above that elusive 50-DMA since.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Copper.png))**

> Crude oil has been just as weak as copper lately, trading in a well-defined downtrend and breaking below its 200-DMA in early August. There was a little bit of a bounce last week, but resistance came into play at the 200-DMA, and after making another lower high, it has since made another lower low.

> When stock, commodity, bond, or any other asset class is in a well-defined downtrend, the first thing they have to do to break out of their funks is clear resistance at key moving averages like the 50 and/or 200-DMA. In the case of copper and crude, they have both recently come up short. The S&P 500, again, is facing some resistance at its 200-DMA, but at least it has managed to clear its 50-DMA which it did in the second half of July.

> # Summer Rally Top: Almanac Aggregate Cycle

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7e8069b2c2bd4e8de914d770f3d6de87/4c5d67735406068a-67/s500x750/5166d3e30c8566f6c5b3725cdf1409b76e765d5a.jpg))**

> Bear market rally or new bull, the 2022 summer rally looks like its run it’s course. With the summer rally pushing DJIA up 13.5% from the June low with S&P up 17.2% and NASDAQ up 23.3% here’s what we are looking at.

> This impressive comeback rally pushed through technical resistance at the June highs. But our indicators and cycles analysis suggest another leg down that culminates in a lower low or retest of the lows at some point in the weak seasonal period August-October ahead of the midterm election.

> Last week’s inflation numbers were certainly encouraging. But we would like to see further confirmation before moving into the bullish camp. We are bullish for Q4 and 2023 but remain vigilant about the potential for another leg down that either tests the June lows or makes a new low.

> In preparation for the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac, we developed this brand-new Stock Trader’s Almanac Aggregate Cycle index (STAAC). STA Aggregate Cycle is a combination of the 1-Year Seasonal Pattern for All Years, the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle and the Decennial Cycle. In the chart here STAAC is all years, midterm years and second years of decades post-WWII from 1946-2021.

> # Housing Descending

> Updates on Building Permits and Housing Starts were mixed relative to expectations for July. While Building Permits exceeded forecasts by 34K, Housing Starts missed forecasts by 81K falling to the lowest annualized rate (1.446 million) since February 2021. Housing represents a large share of the US economy on both a direct and indirect basis, so its health says about the state of the overall economy, Below we have updated our chart of Housing Starts on an average 12-month basis overlaid on top of recessions. Every recession since the late 1960s has been preceded by a rollover in the average rate of Housing Starts, and usually, the rollover starts well in advance of the recession.

> For the current period, Housing Starts remain right near their highest levels of the cycle, but if you look real closely, you can see that the level peaked three months ago. Looking out over history, there are plenty of other periods where Starts declined for a few months but didn't roll over. In other words, based on what we've seen so far, Housing Starts have yet to show signals of an imminent recession. Based on this month's reading and the readings from a year ago, barring a major rebound, the 12-month average is likely to keep declining in the months ahead. Another factor to keep in mind about the historical relationship between Housing Starts and recessions is that in most cases, the recession didn't usually begin until months after the peak of Housing Starts.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Housing-Starts-12-M.png))**

> Taking a closer look at recent trends, the chart below shows the 12-month average of Building Permits and Housing Starts since the start of 2010. It's easier here to see the decline in Starts over the last few months. Building Permits, meanwhile, have continued to trend higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits.png))**

> On a single-family basis, though, both Building Permits and Housing Starts have shown signs of rolling over. Single-family Housing Starts have been moving sideways for over a year now and have just recently seen an acceleration in the rate of decline while Building Permits have been trending lower for a full year now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits-Single.png))**

> Finally, the chart below compares the performance of Housing Starts over time to the performance of homebuilder stocks using the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) as a proxy. While the two have tended to track each other over time, over the last couple of months, ITB has rallied while Housing Starts have been dropping. Either the market knows something about future developments in the residential housing market or investors have gotten a little offside in their positioning.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/StockMarket?

764,"ZOOM (ZM) has earnings tonight, puts are going to print massively.","Video conferencing platform Zoom (ZM) will be reporting earnings tonight after the bell. This is why I think puts are a good idea.

Last quarter Zoom Video reported revenues of $1.07 billion, up 12.2% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. Despite the stock rising on the results, it was a weaker quarter for the company, with a decline in net revenue retention rate and a slow revenue growth. The company added 191 enterprise customers paying more than $100,000 annually to a total of 2,916.

This quarter analysts are expecting Zoom Video's revenue to grow 9.32% year on year to $1.11 billion, slowing down from the 53.9% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.93 per share.

Majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last thirty days, suggesting they are expecting the business to stay the course heading into the earnings. The company has a history of exceeding Wall St's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years on average by 8.32%.

Looking at Zoom Video's peers in the video conferencing segment, some of them have already reported Q2 earnings results, giving us a hint what we can expect. [Five9](https://www.five9.com/) delivered top-line growth of 31.7% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 5.16% and [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/) reported revenues up 28.3% year on year, exceeding estimates by 1.01%. Five9 traded up 8.25% on the results, RingCentral was up 8.67%. 

Investors in the software segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks up on average 0.69% over the last month. Zoom Video is down 10.7% during the same time. It's easy to consider ZM has a stock that hit it's 15 min of fame during the pandemic and is now struggling to maintain it's grasp on the video conference sphere as competitors start to pop up. Investors will be buying based on future outlook and it's not looking too good.

Zoom Video Communications Inc. is struggling to convince people to pay for its videoconferencing service in the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a trimmed forecast and falling stock price Monday.

Zoom ZM, -2.07% executives reduced their earnings and revenue guidance for the fiscal year Monday afternoon, and Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg blamed a stronger U.S. dollar — a problem many global tech companies have called out in recent earnings reports — but also a decline in “the online business,” or the more casual Zoom user.

“Our revenue was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, performance of the online business, and to a lesser extent sales weighted to the back end of the quarter,” Steckelberg said in a statement included with the results.

In an interview with MarketWatch and a conference call Monday afternoon, Steckelberg acknowledged that individuals and small businesses have changed their habits. Many aren’t flocking to the service as often or for as long as they did during the peak of the pandemic, when many Americans were working almost exclusively from home and socializing with friends over the service. An increase in one-on-one meetups, vacations and hybrid work schedules have altered the post-pandemic business cycle for Zoom, executives acknowledge, and getting users to pay is harder.

“The big challenge is new customer additions,” she said.

Zoom recently installed a 40-minute limit on users with a Basic, or free, subscription, which Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi said could be a way to push more users to become paying subscribers. Steckelberg told MarketWatch that the time cap has had a “significantly positive impact” so far, but admitted in the conference call it was “not enough to overcome the macro dynamics.”

The news wasn’t all bad — Zoom’s enterprise business, which sells subscriptions to larger organizations, grew 27% to $599 million. Enterprise customers improved 18% to 204,100 over the past year through contracts with UCLA, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -7.43% and others, as well as longer deals. Zoom Phone licenses hit a record of nearly 4 million, up more than 100% year-over-year.

“It was a mixed quarter, with enterprise proving to be strong,” Steckelberg told MarketWatch.

The ongoing friction between employees who wish to continue to work from home and employers like Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.30%, Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -2.53% GOOG, -2.58% Google and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META, -2.92% — all of whom are sitting on acres of unused commercial real estate and asking workers to come in at least twice a week — could have a profound impact on Zoom. A group of Apple employees on Monday launched a petition asking CEO Tim Cook for a more flexible work policy.

The company also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.94%, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -2.03%, Google and many other corners.

M Science’s software analyst Charles Rogers believes users aren’t jumping to other platforms, but cutting the service because of inflation and more relaxed pandemic guidelines. He also saw more worrisome results internationally than in the U.S., with a second consecutive quarterly decline in the European region and sequentially flat sales in the Asia Pacific quadrant.

Zoom posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $45.7 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, up from $1.02 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, Zoom reported earnings of $1.05 a share, down from $1.36 a share last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 94 cents a share on revenue of $1.12 billion.

Zoom executives said they now expect full-year adjusted earnings of $3.66 to $3.69 a share on revenue of roughly $4.39 billion, down from $3.70 to $3.77 a share on sales of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion. For the third quarter, they expect 82 to 83 cents a share on revenue of about $1.1 billion, while analysts on average had been projecting 92 cents a share on sales of $1.15 billion, according to FactSet.

Zoom shares declined nearly 9% in after-hours trading following release of the results, after closing with a 2.1% decline at $97.44. Zoom’s stock is down 47% so far in 2022. The broader S&P 500 index  SPX, -2.14%  has slid 13% this year.",2022-08-22 21:48:45

770,Back to UCaaS stock discussions (RingCentral),"Now it hasn't been too long since my last analysis, but I'm trying to make sense of the situation on this stock. No new news, yet it's down like 20% from a week ago. I don't see any other stocks with 0 news down 20% that have shown strong earnings and forward guidance. 

This stock was dragged down with Avaya, and when Avaya went up, this stock got dragged down even harder. Now it's probably relating itself to Zoom which had a bad forecast, but ZM numbers are coming down, so it makes sense for their stock to continue to trend downward till their guidance gets more accurate.

So it begs the question, why. is this stock in particular getting driven lower when fundamentally it still hasn't changed. Looking at the 5 year chart, if you held this stock it would have only netted you 10% gain. That doesn't seen to make a lot of sense, based on their trajectory of REV. Video conferencing and telephone services aren't going anywhere, and it won't be the first service cut from your martech stack. 

My average is now almost 48 after buying a lot on the way down, but i didn't expect it to break down this far. Thoughts on this jumping back to at least 50 in the next few months? Bad stock months around the corner, yet this didn't even bounce during June and July when other stocks were going up.",2022-08-23 23:10:42

# [Stock futures flat following the S&P 500′s third straight losing day](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors await more guidance from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the central bank’s tightening path.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all roughly flat.
*****
> Both the Dow and the S&P 500 declined for a third straight session Tuesday amid relatively thin trading volumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished Tuesday little changed. The S&P 500 is about flat on the month after rallying more than 9% in July.
*****
> The three-day Jackson Hole economic symposium starts Thursday with Powell slated to speak Friday morning. Fed watchers expect him to reinforce the central bank’s goal of squashing inflation and keeping expectations about future prices gains in check.
*****
> “Financial markets will remain in choppy waters until Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “He may struggle to convince markets that he is comfortable with tightening policy and triggering a recession. The economy is clearly slowing but it is still too early for the Fed to signal that they will be less aggressive with tightening policy.”
*****
> Investors will also monitor incoming data to gauge the health of the economy. Durable goods and pending home sales are on deck for Wednesday.

774,Graphene Manufacturing Group ($GMG.v $GMGMF) trading green w/ above avg vol following influx of positive news,"**Graphene Manufacturing Group ($GMG.v $GMGMF)** trading green w/ above average volume @ $3.87, $305.27M MC as it **begins its move into the next phase of development.**

This **next phase is an expansion project for its graphene manufacturing facility to produce energy-saving products and batteries at scale.**

Based on the level of positive feedback from GMG's G+Al battery coin cell prototype testing and graphene production process, this expansion is necessary and this phase is expected to provide graphene supply for the production of the battery coin cells and energy-saving liquid graphene products.

As GMG CEO Craig Nichol commented, this news is a solid example of the level of confidence GMG has in both manufacturing high-quality graphene for applications at scale, as well as in commercializing energy savings and energy storage applications in the near term. 

Plus, [**GMG recently appointed CFO Frederick Kotzee to its board of directors & Anjana Reddy to the company secretary role.**](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/gmg-board-additions-director-company-112800494.html)  Notably, Kotzee has 20+ years of public company experience and was previously the CFO of Kidman Resources where he successfully secured financing and offtake agreements for over $750M.

GMG is additionally set **to acquire the IP for ThermalXR** and has a plan to align the value chain for customer needs by optimizing the particular coating for customer requirements. GMG has already seen good traction and good sales for **ThermalXR** and expects it **to be a large business in itself.**

776,I Tried 4 Paid Services for Stock Selection: Here are The Results for 2021 and 2022,"**ZACKS**

**TLDR**

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity’s platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what’s new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It’s quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don’t outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.  


I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don’t tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It’s since back to slightly above the purchase price.

**Zacks Top 10 Stocks of 2021 -** their premium offering and associated returns. I did not buy all of these - only SPSC and PWR. But I did track them all in a watchlist.

&#x200B;

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it’s best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It’s good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I’ve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It’s good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. 

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I’ve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don’t beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you’ve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I’m choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don’t like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company’s control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I’ve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I’ve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I’m noting hold times since it’s not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.   
2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days   
2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.   
5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the “Elon will back out” trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would’ve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I’m selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It’s like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can’t seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22  +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.   
8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22  -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits. 

&#x200B;

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don’t try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would’ve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It’s time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

**12/17/21 Buy Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then**

**I Tracked Every investment from their Small Caps Playbook List from January 2021. Here are their returns since then.**

* **Percent Winners: 33%**
* **Avg return per rec: -25%**

1. Redacted by mods -88%

6. Inspire Medical Systems: +14%
7. Blocked by mods: -34%
8. NCino: -48%
9. Blocked by mods: 0%

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day’s opening price.

&#x200B;

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right…years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall’s Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn’t take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn’t do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.  


7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I’m holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I’m still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don’t hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it’s slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

The deal, which is expected to close next year, includes a $1 billion break-up fee for both sides, with Figma CEO Dylan Field expected to continue leading the group when its folded into Adobe.

Adobe also posted record revenues of $4.43 billion for the three months ending on September 2, its fiscal third quarter, a 13% increase from last year, with an adjusted non-GAAP bottom line of $3.40 per share.

Looking into the current quarter, however, Adobe said it sees revenues of around $4.52 billion, a tally that came in just shy of forecasts from Refinitiv, as strong dollar headwinds continue to weigh on overseas sales.

""Fueled by our groundbreaking technology, track record of creating and leading categories and consistent execution, Adobe delivered another record quarter,” said CEO Shantanu Narayen. “With the announcement of our intent to acquire Figma, we believe we have a unique opportunity to usher in a new era of collaborative creativity.”

# **Dow drops nearly 500 points to close at new low for 2022 on rising recession fears - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/futures-inch-higher-following-another-day-of-losses-after-fed-rate-hike-sell-offs.html)**
*****
> Stocks tumbled Friday to cap a brutal week for financial markets, as surging interest rates and foreign currency turmoil heightened fears of a global recession.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 486.27 points, or 1.62%, to 29,590.41. The S&P 500 slid 1.72% to 3,693.23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8% to 10,867.93.
*****
> The Dow notched a new low for the year and closed below 30,000 for the first time since June 17. The 30-stock index ended the day 19.9% below an intraday record, flirting with bear market territory. At one point, the Dow was down more than 826 points.
*****
> The major averages capped their fifth negative week in six, with the Dow giving up 4%. The S&P and Nasdaq shed 4.65% and 5.07%, respectively. It marked the fourth negative session in a row for stocks, as the Fed on Wednesday enacted another super-sized rate hike of 75 basis points and indicated it would do another at its November meeting.
*****
> “The market has been transitioning clearly and quickly from worries over inflation to concerns over the aggressive Federal Reserve campaign,” said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial. “You see bond yields rising to levels we haven’t seen in years — it’s changing the mindset to how does the Fed get to price stability without something breaking.”
*****
> The British pound hit a fresh more than three-decade low against the U.S. dollar after a new U.K. economic plan that included a slew of tax cuts rattled markets that are fearing inflation above all right now. Major European markets lost 2% on the day.
*****
> “This is a global macro mess that the market is trying to sort out,” Krosby said.
*****
> Bond yields soared this week following the Fed’s actions, with the 2-year and 10-year Treasury rates hitting highs not seen in over a decade.
*****
> Goldman Sachs cut its year-end S&P 500 target because of rising rates, predicting at least a 4% downside from here.
*****
> Stocks positioned to suffer the most in a recession led the week’s losses with the S&P 500′s consumer discretionary sector falling 7%. Energy slumped 9% as oil prices dropped. Growth stocks, including big technology names Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms fell on Friday.
*****
> “Based on our client discussions, a majority of equity investors have adopted the view that a hard landing scenario is inevitable and their focus is on the timing, magnitude, and duration of a potential recession and investment strategies for that outlook,” wrote Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin in a note to clients as he cut his outlook.

> So, it might be a bit late for Sell Rosh Hashanah, but Buy Yom Kippur is looking like a good set up. A host of fears from inflation, hawkish Fed, bellicose Russia, global upheaval, US midterm politics is exacerbating the usual seasonal and 4-year cycle carnage.

> The thesis is that folks sell positions on Rosh Hashanah the first of the Days of Awe to rid themselves of financial commitments and then return to the market after Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It is no coincidence that this coincides with the seasonal September/October weakness.

> Interestingly the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period is not so bad in midterm years, likely due to the fact it lands at the end of the Weak Spot and the beginning of the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year cycle – the best buying opportunity of the 4-Year Cycle.

> # Five Reasons Inflation Isn’t So Sticky

> After the disappointing all around Consumer Price Index (CPI) report last week, the worries over inflation staying higher for longer (what they call sticky) is a very real worry. That report showed prices for many goods and services were increasing more than expected (even things like dental services were much higher than expected), while nearly every economist we saw on tv before the report was saying inflation had peaked and would be heading down, and in a hurry.

> Full disclosure, I was in that camp as well, as I discussed with Yahoo! Finance here.

> Well, it isn’t all bad news, as there are many signs inflation could still come back down quickly. For one thing gas prices continue to head lower, as my colleague Sonu Varghese recently wrote about. Sure, core consumer prices (excluding energy and food) are higher than anyone would like, but there are other types of inflation than just at the consumer level.

> Here are five reasons that suggest inflation could still fall quite quickly and last month’s CPI data isn’t the beginning of a new trend.

> First up, used car prices collapsed four percent last month according to the Manheim Used Car Value Index. This was the second largest monthly decline ever and the year-over-year change is down to 8.4%, the lowest since June 2020. This large drop wasn’t accounted for in the recent CPI report and will put downward pressure on prices over the coming months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-092122.png))**

> Second, how much companies are paying for things is going down and quickly. Looking at the prices paid component of the ISM services and manufacturing surveys show a big move lower the past few months. Prices paid tends to lead overall CPI by several months, and so this is another reason to think inflation could come down quickly before year-end.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-092122.png))**

> Third, the ISM is a national survey, but regional surveys show similar results. The recent Philly Fed and Empire State surveys each show prices paid crashing lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-092122.png))**

> Fourth, supply chain issues were a major reason for the huge spike in inflation. So, you would think once those supply chains begin to improve, so would inflation. The good news is we are seeing substantial improvements in supply chains. For instance, back in January more than 100 ships were caught in a logjam at the Port of Los Angeles, yet earlier this month there were less than 10 ships. And as the chart below shows, overall supply chain pressures have come down significantly. Another source of potential downward pressure on overall inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-092122.png))**

> Lastly, prices at the producer level have come back much quicker than at the consumer level. The Producer Price Index (PPI) year-over-year peaked at 11.6% in March, but it was already down to 8.7% five months later. Compare that with the CPI peaking at just over 9.0% and only at 8.3% currently.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-092122.png))**

> So there you have it. Inflation is still a major issue, and that recent CPI report wasn’t pretty in any way. But there is light at the end of the inflation tunnel, as other aspects of inflation is showing some incredible improvement and not many people are noticing.

***** 

> # September to (Not) Remember

> Hat tip George Noble @gnoble79 for this title from his superb Twitter Space today. He has been on point all year. Disappointing CPI and increasingly hawkish remarks and action from the Fed clearly brought the usual September peak early. But that does not mean we are out of the woods.

> Late September is still a dangerous period for the market, especially month-end, and then there is Octoberphobia to contend with, which promises to be turbulent with all the market must digest. On top of the Fed, inflation, weaker fundamentals, fickle market internals, shaky technicals we have the negative seasonality from fund tax selling, end of Q3 window dressing and portfolio restructuring.

> We have been cautious all year and mostly in cash, having honored our stops and indicators. June lows are only 1% away for the Dow, S&P 3.4%, NASDAQ 5.4%, Russell 2000 6.8%. Cash is still king. Patience is in order. We are sticking to our Seasonal Trading Playbook. If you’re not nimble and able to trade quickly, wait for our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

> # Worse Before It Gets Better

> For those checking in on our Seasonality Tool in the past week, the current point of the year can either look like one of the worst, middling, or best times of the year depending on the time frame. As shown below, the median one-week performance of the S&P 500 from the close on 9/20 over the last ten years has been a decline of 95 bps loss which ranks in just the fourth percentile of all days of the year. Extending out to look at the S&P 500's median one-month performance, the 105 bps median gain is about smack dab in the middle of the range of historical one-month returns. Moving out to three months, the S&P 500's median gain of 578 bps ranks in the top 5% of all days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-1.png))**

> To look at seasonality in another way, the charts below show the average S&P 500 5-day performance (including a smoothed look via a 7-day moving average) and the percentage of time the index has traded positively at each calendar day of the year going all the way back to 1945. The current week of the year has averaged some of the worst one-week returns for the S&P 500 across all years of the post-WWII period while the index has tended to fall more often than not.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-5-Day.png))**

> Again, contrary to short-term seasonal weakness, taking a similar look but using a 3-month performance window, we are entering one of the best times of the year. As shown below, the second half of September into October sees the average 3-month performance rocket higher and by early October has tended to be the strongest of any point of the year.

> # The Biggest Pandemic Losers

> With President Biden declaring that ""the pandemic is over"" on 60 Minutes last night, we thought we'd take a look at stock market performance since the pandemic began. At its peak on January 3rd, 2022, the S&P 500 was up more than 40% from its closing price on February 19th, 2020 -- the peak reading for the index prior to the COVID Crash. After entering bear market territory in 2022, the S&P is currently only 14% above its pre-COVID high. In the Russell 1,000 -- another large-cap index -- 41% of stocks are now trading below their closing price on February 19th, 2020. 20% of stocks in the index are down more than 20%! Given that two and a half years have passed, we think it's safe to say that any stock down 20% from pre-COVID levels has been a ""pandemic loser."" At least at this point in time.

> Below are stocks with market caps above $15 billion that are down at least 20% from their closing price on 2/19/20. Names like Boeing (BA), Delta (DAL), Uber (UBER), and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) were some of the initial ""lockdown losers"" that never really recovered, but other stocks that were initially viewed as ""lockdown winners"" are also on the list like Netflix (NFLX), Meta (META), Spotify (SPOT), and Zoom Video (ZM). Go figure.

> Boeing (BA) and Intel (INTC) have been two of the biggest losers since pre-COVID with declines of more than 56%. Other ""blue chips"" that have been crushed since the pandemic hit include Biogen (BIIB), Citigroup (C), General Electric (GE), Verizon (VZ), 3M (MMM), Square (SQ), Disney (DIS), Adobe (ADBE), and salesforce (CRM). It's interesting that there's representation from nearly every sector of the economy on this list. The only sector that's NOT included is Energy, which is crazy since the sector was one of the hardest hit in the early days of COVID as the price of oil even went negative for a day.

> Of course, COVID isn't the reason why all of these large-cap stocks are now down so much since the pandemic began, but the performance numbers are the performance numbers, and there's no getting around it. Management at big travel & leisure companies have always wished COVID never happened, but more and more companies in sectors like Tech that thought the pandemic might be a game-changer for them in a positive way are now staring at big 2+ year declines thinking ""what the hell just happened.""

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 26th, 2022.

# **Dow drops nearly 500 points to close at new low for 2022 on rising recession fears - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/futures-inch-higher-following-another-day-of-losses-after-fed-rate-hike-sell-offs.html)**
*****
> Stocks tumbled Friday to cap a brutal week for financial markets, as surging interest rates and foreign currency turmoil heightened fears of a global recession.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 486.27 points, or 1.62%, to 29,590.41. The S&P 500 slid 1.72% to 3,693.23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8% to 10,867.93.
*****
> The Dow notched a new low for the year and closed below 30,000 for the first time since June 17. The 30-stock index ended the day 19.9% below an intraday record, flirting with bear market territory. At one point, the Dow was down more than 826 points.
*****
> The major averages capped their fifth negative week in six, with the Dow giving up 4%. The S&P and Nasdaq shed 4.65% and 5.07%, respectively. It marked the fourth negative session in a row for stocks, as the Fed on Wednesday enacted another super-sized rate hike of 75 basis points and indicated it would do another at its November meeting.
*****
> “The market has been transitioning clearly and quickly from worries over inflation to concerns over the aggressive Federal Reserve campaign,” said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial. “You see bond yields rising to levels we haven’t seen in years — it’s changing the mindset to how does the Fed get to price stability without something breaking.”
*****
> The British pound hit a fresh more than three-decade low against the U.S. dollar after a new U.K. economic plan that included a slew of tax cuts rattled markets that are fearing inflation above all right now. Major European markets lost 2% on the day.
*****
> “This is a global macro mess that the market is trying to sort out,” Krosby said.
*****
> Bond yields soared this week following the Fed’s actions, with the 2-year and 10-year Treasury rates hitting highs not seen in over a decade.
*****
> Goldman Sachs cut its year-end S&P 500 target because of rising rates, predicting at least a 4% downside from here.
*****
> Stocks positioned to suffer the most in a recession led the week’s losses with the S&P 500′s consumer discretionary sector falling 7%. Energy slumped 9% as oil prices dropped. Growth stocks, including big technology names Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms fell on Friday.
*****
> “Based on our client discussions, a majority of equity investors have adopted the view that a hard landing scenario is inevitable and their focus is on the timing, magnitude, and duration of a potential recession and investment strategies for that outlook,” wrote Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin in a note to clients as he cut his outlook.

> So, it might be a bit late for Sell Rosh Hashanah, but Buy Yom Kippur is looking like a good set up. A host of fears from inflation, hawkish Fed, bellicose Russia, global upheaval, US midterm politics is exacerbating the usual seasonal and 4-year cycle carnage.

> The thesis is that folks sell positions on Rosh Hashanah the first of the Days of Awe to rid themselves of financial commitments and then return to the market after Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It is no coincidence that this coincides with the seasonal September/October weakness.

> Interestingly the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period is not so bad in midterm years, likely due to the fact it lands at the end of the Weak Spot and the beginning of the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year cycle – the best buying opportunity of the 4-Year Cycle.

> # Five Reasons Inflation Isn’t So Sticky

> After the disappointing all around Consumer Price Index (CPI) report last week, the worries over inflation staying higher for longer (what they call sticky) is a very real worry. That report showed prices for many goods and services were increasing more than expected (even things like dental services were much higher than expected), while nearly every economist we saw on tv before the report was saying inflation had peaked and would be heading down, and in a hurry.

> Full disclosure, I was in that camp as well, as I discussed with Yahoo! Finance here.

> Well, it isn’t all bad news, as there are many signs inflation could still come back down quickly. For one thing gas prices continue to head lower, as my colleague Sonu Varghese recently wrote about. Sure, core consumer prices (excluding energy and food) are higher than anyone would like, but there are other types of inflation than just at the consumer level.

> Here are five reasons that suggest inflation could still fall quite quickly and last month’s CPI data isn’t the beginning of a new trend.

> First up, used car prices collapsed four percent last month according to the Manheim Used Car Value Index. This was the second largest monthly decline ever and the year-over-year change is down to 8.4%, the lowest since June 2020. This large drop wasn’t accounted for in the recent CPI report and will put downward pressure on prices over the coming months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-092122.png))**

> Second, how much companies are paying for things is going down and quickly. Looking at the prices paid component of the ISM services and manufacturing surveys show a big move lower the past few months. Prices paid tends to lead overall CPI by several months, and so this is another reason to think inflation could come down quickly before year-end.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-092122.png))**

> Third, the ISM is a national survey, but regional surveys show similar results. The recent Philly Fed and Empire State surveys each show prices paid crashing lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-092122.png))**

> Fourth, supply chain issues were a major reason for the huge spike in inflation. So, you would think once those supply chains begin to improve, so would inflation. The good news is we are seeing substantial improvements in supply chains. For instance, back in January more than 100 ships were caught in a logjam at the Port of Los Angeles, yet earlier this month there were less than 10 ships. And as the chart below shows, overall supply chain pressures have come down significantly. Another source of potential downward pressure on overall inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-092122.png))**

> Lastly, prices at the producer level have come back much quicker than at the consumer level. The Producer Price Index (PPI) year-over-year peaked at 11.6% in March, but it was already down to 8.7% five months later. Compare that with the CPI peaking at just over 9.0% and only at 8.3% currently.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-092122.png))**

> So there you have it. Inflation is still a major issue, and that recent CPI report wasn’t pretty in any way. But there is light at the end of the inflation tunnel, as other aspects of inflation is showing some incredible improvement and not many people are noticing.

***** 

> # September to (Not) Remember

> Hat tip George Noble @gnoble79 for this title from his superb Twitter Space today. He has been on point all year. Disappointing CPI and increasingly hawkish remarks and action from the Fed clearly brought the usual September peak early. But that does not mean we are out of the woods.

> Late September is still a dangerous period for the market, especially month-end, and then there is Octoberphobia to contend with, which promises to be turbulent with all the market must digest. On top of the Fed, inflation, weaker fundamentals, fickle market internals, shaky technicals we have the negative seasonality from fund tax selling, end of Q3 window dressing and portfolio restructuring.

> We have been cautious all year and mostly in cash, having honored our stops and indicators. June lows are only 1% away for the Dow, S&P 3.4%, NASDAQ 5.4%, Russell 2000 6.8%. Cash is still king. Patience is in order. We are sticking to our Seasonal Trading Playbook. If you’re not nimble and able to trade quickly, wait for our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

> # Worse Before It Gets Better

> For those checking in on our Seasonality Tool in the past week, the current point of the year can either look like one of the worst, middling, or best times of the year depending on the time frame. As shown below, the median one-week performance of the S&P 500 from the close on 9/20 over the last ten years has been a decline of 95 bps loss which ranks in just the fourth percentile of all days of the year. Extending out to look at the S&P 500's median one-month performance, the 105 bps median gain is about smack dab in the middle of the range of historical one-month returns. Moving out to three months, the S&P 500's median gain of 578 bps ranks in the top 5% of all days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-1.png))**

> To look at seasonality in another way, the charts below show the average S&P 500 5-day performance (including a smoothed look via a 7-day moving average) and the percentage of time the index has traded positively at each calendar day of the year going all the way back to 1945. The current week of the year has averaged some of the worst one-week returns for the S&P 500 across all years of the post-WWII period while the index has tended to fall more often than not.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-5-Day.png))**

> Again, contrary to short-term seasonal weakness, taking a similar look but using a 3-month performance window, we are entering one of the best times of the year. As shown below, the second half of September into October sees the average 3-month performance rocket higher and by early October has tended to be the strongest of any point of the year.

> # The Biggest Pandemic Losers

> With President Biden declaring that ""the pandemic is over"" on 60 Minutes last night, we thought we'd take a look at stock market performance since the pandemic began. At its peak on January 3rd, 2022, the S&P 500 was up more than 40% from its closing price on February 19th, 2020 -- the peak reading for the index prior to the COVID Crash. After entering bear market territory in 2022, the S&P is currently only 14% above its pre-COVID high. In the Russell 1,000 -- another large-cap index -- 41% of stocks are now trading below their closing price on February 19th, 2020. 20% of stocks in the index are down more than 20%! Given that two and a half years have passed, we think it's safe to say that any stock down 20% from pre-COVID levels has been a ""pandemic loser."" At least at this point in time.

> Below are stocks with market caps above $15 billion that are down at least 20% from their closing price on 2/19/20. Names like Boeing (BA), Delta (DAL), Uber (UBER), and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) were some of the initial ""lockdown losers"" that never really recovered, but other stocks that were initially viewed as ""lockdown winners"" are also on the list like Netflix (NFLX), Meta (META), Spotify (SPOT), and Zoom Video (ZM). Go figure.

> Boeing (BA) and Intel (INTC) have been two of the biggest losers since pre-COVID with declines of more than 56%. Other ""blue chips"" that have been crushed since the pandemic hit include Biogen (BIIB), Citigroup (C), General Electric (GE), Verizon (VZ), 3M (MMM), Square (SQ), Disney (DIS), Adobe (ADBE), and salesforce (CRM). It's interesting that there's representation from nearly every sector of the economy on this list. The only sector that's NOT included is Energy, which is crazy since the sector was one of the hardest hit in the early days of COVID as the price of oil even went negative for a day.

> Of course, COVID isn't the reason why all of these large-cap stocks are now down so much since the pandemic began, but the performance numbers are the performance numbers, and there's no getting around it. Management at big travel & leisure companies have always wished COVID never happened, but more and more companies in sectors like Tech that thought the pandemic might be a game-changer for them in a positive way are now staring at big 2+ year declines thinking ""what the hell just happened.""

785,Thoughts on BASF,"

BASF is the largest chemical company in the world. They generated €86bn in revenue and €12bn in EBITDA (14% margin) as of Jun-22 LTM. They are currently struggling because of the gas/energy shortage in Europe (chemical processes are heavily reliant on oil and gas). I have collected some information on BASF and the current situation. I have also attached an Excel model. Feel free to download it and play around with the assumptions. I will probably add some more information, comments, and opinions as time goes on.

# The BASF Verbund

* The key competitive advantage of BASF is the Verbund (German for compound). Production sites use input materials and energy more efficiently. For instance, the waste heat of one plant is transferred as energy to another and by-products of one production process are used as input for another.
* BASF has six Verbund (2 in US, 1 in NL, 1 in GER, 1 in CHN, 1 in MY) and 232 additional production sites.
* The Verbund synergies saved 7.3m metric tons of CO2 in 2021 by combining heat and power generation, 47% of production waste is recycled, and 79% of water recirculated. The Verbund saved 21.4m MWh of electricity in 2021.

# Energy consumption

* The production is very energy intensive.
* The most important raw materials are gas and oil-based products.
* BASF had an electricity demand of 58.8 TWh in 2021. This is equivalent to approx. 20m households (assuming 3 kWh per household). The European operations require 48 TWh of energy. 37 TWh alone are related to BASF’s largest production plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany. The plant will still be operable up to a 50% reduction in gas supply. If the gas supply is reduced beyond 50%, the plant must be shut down which is extremely costly. Especially restarting all the chemical processes is difficult.
* BASF generates 58% of their power requirement with own gas and own steam turbines.
* According to BASF, if they reduced their gas usage from 100% to 50%, that would lower Germany’s total gas usage by just 2%.
* BASF does not expect the gas shortage to lower sales in 2022.
* They acquired 50% of a 1.5-gigawatt offshore wind park from Vattenfall for €300m in 2021 but reduced the stake to 24%. The wind park will be connected to the grid in 2023.
* They hold 73% of Wintershall Dea (an oil and gas business). The IPO was planned in 2021 but postponed. Wintershall Dea produces approx. 630k barrel of oil equivalents per day. 40% of it is Russian gas.
* BASF entered two 25-years electricity supply contracts with Orsted (200 MW in 2021) and Engie (up to 21 TWh in 2022).
* In general, BASF wants to push for renewable energy sources, improve in-house energy recovery, and invest in own power assets.

# Investments

* BASF currently pushes into two promising and sustainable business areas:

1. They are heavily investing into battery materials. BASF wants to produce cathode materials for cell manufacturers.
2. They are also developing novel recycling concepts. The first plant is expected to go live by 2023 in Schwarzheide, Germany. Currently, BASF generates €8-9bn in revenue from circular economy products, i.e., products based on recycled and renewable input.

* By 2026, BASF wants to invest €26bn as CapEx.
* $10bn alone are related to the new Verbund production site in Zhanjiang, China, which is still under construction. The new site is expected to generate €4-5bn in revenue and €1.0-1.2bn in EBITDA. China is the largest chemical market with the highest growth rates.
* As of Jun-22 LTM, BASF spent €2.3bn on R&D (2.7% of revenue). In 2021, they had 290 R&D collaborations and filed 820 new patents. 
* According to their research, BASF holds top three market positions in 80% of their business areas.

# Financials

* BASF has seen revenue growth of 11% p.a. (2018 to Jun-22 LTM). Most of this growth is due to significantly higher prices in 2021 and 2022 and slightly higher volume in 2021.
* EBITDA margins have averaged 14% over the last four years.
* 67% of sales are generated in North America and Europe with 15% CAGR (2019 to Jun-22 LTM)
* 26% of sales are generated in APAC with 20% CAGR (2019 to Jun-22 LTM)
* 7% of sales are generated in RoW with 6% CAGR (2019 to Jun-22 LTM)
* BASF spent €3.8bn on natural gas in Europe as of Jun-22 LTM. This is +600% higher compared to the €0.5bn in 2020 and 160% higher compared to the €2bn in 2021.
* The company has net debt of €32bn (0.9x of current market cap of €36bn and 2.6x of Jun-22 LTM EBITDA of €12bn).
* The company announced a €3bn share buyback until Dec-22. €1.1bn have been repurchased as of Jun-22.

# Business units

**Surface technologies**

* Sales of €21.7bn, EBITDA of €1.1bn (margin of 5%), and R&D of €296m (1.4% of revenue).
* “Surface technologies” produces chemicals to treat surfaces for the catalysts/coatings/battery materials sectors
* Exemplary products are automotive catalysts, battery materials, coatings for automotive applications, and decorative paints.
* In this segment, BASF plans to push more into the battery materials sector. An interesting initiative is the recycling of batteries to reuse the raw materials.

**Materials**

* Sales of €17.7bn, EBITDA of €3.2bn (margin of 28%), and R&D of €193m (1.1% of revenue).
* “Materials” produces plastics and monomers (ammonia, chlorine, and resins).
* BASF’s key success factors are the more sustainable production process, the simulation of plastic properties, and the individualized products and services.

**Chemicals**

* Sales of €15.8bn, EBITDA of €3.9bn (margin of 24%), and R&D of €97m (0.6% of revenue).
* “Chemicals” produces basic chemicals that the other business units and third-party customers use to develop higher value-added products.
* BASF’s key success factors are economies of scale and the more efficient use of raw materials and energy.

**Agricultural solutions**

* Sales of €9.2bn, EBITDA of €1.6bn (margin of 18%), and R&D of €904m (9.8% of revenue).
* “Agricultural solutions” produces seeds, crop protection, and digital solutions for farmers.

**Industrial solutions**

* Sales of €9.5bn, EBITDA of €1.4bn (margin of 15%), and R&D of €175m (1.8% of revenue).
* “Industrial solutions” produces materials for industrial applications, fuels and lubricants, paints and coatings, electronic materials, and plastic additives.
* Exemplary products are dispersions and resins, brake fluids, engine coolants, antioxidants, and chemicals for the oil/gas/metal extraction.
* Here, BASF focuses on long-term partnerships with customers.

**Nutrition and care**

* Sales of €7.4bn, EBITDA of €1.0bn (margin of 14%), and R&D of €172m (2.3% of revenue).
* “Nutrition and care” produces ingredients for consumer products like food supplements and personal care.
* Exemplary products are ingredients for skin and hair cleansing, ingredients for detergents and cleaners, additives (vitamins, enzymes, etc.) for the food industry, synthetic flavors, and pharmaceutical ingredients.
* BASF places a particular focus on bio-based and biodegradable products.

# Thoughts

* BASF is still a solid company with consistent margins.
* I tried to justify the current valuation in the Excel model and things (mainly the energy crisis in Europe) have to get quite bad for the current valuation to make sense (but it could still happen).
* I don’t like the massive investments in China. It is the largest market with the highest growth rates but a heavy reliance on China can backfire quickly.
* I do like that BASF is really thinking about their energy supply and that they try to diversify their sources.
* In terms of revenue growth, BASF’s push into battery materials and the circular economy make sense but sales will still be heavily reliant on the automotive industry.
* Here the link to the Excel model: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vtuws3FTxsic8MmifdLtAoWHPY7RttZkHESxdYNYpZM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vtuws3FTxsic8MmifdLtAoWHPY7RttZkHESxdYNYpZM/edit?usp=sharing)",2022-09-30 18:59:54
786,Change in Receivables is different for Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement,"Hi, I'm currently following a valuation course at university. We have to value Zoom (ZM) and we have to forecast the three financial statements. But when looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, I do not understand the logic behind it in the case of Zoom. 

The Accounts receivable is 419,673 and 294,703 for years 2022 and 2021. This means an increase of 124,970. But if we look at the statement of cash flows, it says that Change in Accounts Receivable is 159,183.

 The notes on Accounts Receivable are as following:

> We maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management's estimate for expected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical write-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the establishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our expectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables, including noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Furthermore, the allowance for sales returns is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes to the allowance are classified as a reduction in revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate returns from sales to customers based on historical chargebacks and return rates.  
>  
>For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, our assessment considered business and market disruptions caused by COVID-19 and estimates of credit and collectibility trends. The continued volatility in market conditions and evolving shifts in credit trends are difficult to predict, causing variability and volatility that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. Below is a rollforward of our allowance for credit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.""

What could be an explanation for this difference in the change of Accounts Receivable?

787,DD: My $1M gamble that $ZM acquires $CVT and announces the deal in the next 6 weeks,"I'll try to keep this short because I know most of you can't read. 

Please note that I am making conclusions based on publicly available information from Cvent and Zoom's websites and some public social media posts. 

I have no inside information and don't know if this acquisition will happen.   


**I'm placing a bet. Back in the pre-GME days, this is what we used to do here on Wall Street BETS.**   


**What**: Zoom $ZM to acquire Cvent $CVT

**Price target:** estimate deal will be priced at $8-$12/share 

**When**: possible announcement October 11-13 or November 8-9.

**Why:** Zoom is dominating the virtual meeting and virtual event space. While virtual meetings continue to flourish in a post-pandemic world, virtual events have fallen off a cliff this year (see recent massive layoffs from virtual event specialists like Hopin, Bizzabo, etc). 

Attendees want to go back to in-person, and Zoom does not want to miss out on the lucrative event business. So Zoom created a new division, Zoom Events: [https://explore.zoom.us/en/products/event-platform/](https://explore.zoom.us/en/products/event-platform/).   


Zoom Events

[Zoom Events feature-set completely overlaps Cvent's](https://preview.redd.it/przfqcujhor91.png?width=2370&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d883de7e7fff6028b1c98fe426c604bfeaca50c)

The Zoom Events sales team targets meeting planners and offers a SaaS solution for their **virtual** and **in-person** events, touting **hybrid** is the future of events. 

When I read up on their solution, it sounded an awful lot like Cvent ($CVT). Their feature set almost completely overlaps.

I thought, isn't it weird that Zoom is now competing against Cvent, considering Zoom is one of the largest investors in Cvent: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cvent-to-go-public-via-merger-with-spac-dragoneer-growth-in-53-billion-deal-2021-07-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cvent-to-go-public-via-merger-with-spac-dragoneer-growth-in-53-billion-deal-2021-07-23).  


If Zoom is now competing against Cvent, shouldn't they have divested from the investment (they haven't as far as I've seen in public disclosures).   


So I started searching for Cvent and Zoom connections. Both companies are still promoting integrated apps in their respective app stores: [https://www.cvent.com/en/event-management-software/cvent-zoom-integration](https://www.cvent.com/en/event-management-software/cvent-zoom-integration) and [https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps/UKb\_gycmQ5-iKIO8sjk8cQ](https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps/UKb_gycmQ5-iKIO8sjk8cQ).

I then searched social media and noticed several Cvent employees had posted that they were participating in Zoom's annual Zoomtopia user conference: [https://zoomtopia.com/in-person/](https://zoomtopia.com/in-person/). I thought it was odd that a competitor would be allowed to exhibit at Zoom's event. 

So I dug deeper on the Zoomtopia In-Person event website and clicked on register, and then it hit me. Cvent is providing the online registration for Zoomtopia: 

https://preview.redd.it/9x1v4bm4kor91.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b301356572a4ecb7f868adcda22e266537b4a3d

Zoom Events website shows they offer a competing online registration product, but instead of using it for Zoomtopia, they are using Cvent's. Even if their product was sub-optimal to use for a big event like Zoomtopia, Zoom would likely still follow Silicon Valley's mantra of ""eat your own dog food"" and use their in-house solution.

Another major virtual meeting player, WebEx, recently made the same decision that I believe Zoom is making. WebEx acquired Cvent competitor Socio to create WebEx Events: [https://www.webex.com/events.html](https://www.webex.com/events.html). 

So I believe these hints are enough to believe Zoom will acquire Cvent. But when would the deal be announced? 

Since Cvent will be used extensively at Zoomtopia and Cvent staff will be in attendance, that would be the perfect time to announce (November 8-9). The other potential date is October 11-13 as Cvent is exhibiting at the industry's largest trade show, IMEX America, and has a huge booth very near WebEx Event's booth:

788,Don’t Like Jim Cramer’s Stock Calls? This ETF Bets Against ‘Mad Money’ Host.,"https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/jim-cramer-mad-money-inverse-etf-51665069830

Late Wednesday, Matthew Tuttle of Tuttle Capital Management filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an exchange-traded fund that will bet against the stock recommendations made by Jim Cramer, host of the CNBC show Mad Money.

The idea of a fund that would do the opposite of what Cramer suggests has been a running joke on social platforms like Reddit, where users have periodically ridiculed him for his market views. But the idea is nothing new. Data-journalism articles in Barron’s in 2007 and 2009 found that his picks trailed behind the market.

A Reddit group and at least 10 Twitter handles now keep track of Cramer’s calls. Several indexes have been set up in the past year or so to highlight how an investor would do by betting against his recommendations, though none is linked to an investment vehicle.

“I couldn’t resist,” Tuttle said in a response to a Wednesday tweet by Barron’s reporter Tae Kim noting the filing. He also filed paperwork for a fund, the Long Cramer ETF (ticker: LJIM), that will invest in stocks on which Cramer is positive.

Cramer didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tuttle’s Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) will invest at least 80% of its holdings to achieve the opposite result from what an investor would get by holding the stocks Cramer suggests. It will either sell those stocks short or enter into derivatives transactions such as swaps that produce a negative correlation, the filing said.

Investors may not be surprised that Tuttle is the one bringing the Inverse Cramer ETF to market. This year, the fund manager launched the AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK), which wins when investor Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) loses.

Tuttle’s fund, which readjusts its holdings every day, has risen 104% this year as Wood’s fund has slid as a result of bets on companies such as Zoom Video Communications ( ZM ) and Roku ( ROKU ) 

When that fund was launched, Woods called it “ridiculous” and obsessed with the short term in an interview with CNBC.

An Inverse Cramer index in circulation on Twitter is up 16% so far this year. Of course, with the S&P 500 down sharply this year, a fund betting against the broader market would also be doing well. 

Both the Long Cramer and Inverse Cramer funds will contain 20 to 25 stocks. Tuttle told Barron’s the fees and expenses for the funds haven’t been made public. His AXS Short Innovation Daily has an expense ratio of 0.75%. That means that costs such as administration and marketing amount to $7.50 a year for every $1,000 in the fund.

Investors can start buying the Cramer ETFs in late December. Reddit users are upbeat about the Inverse Cramer fund. “I know what I’ll be buying myself for chistmas! Thnx!,” one said.

At least three others said they plan to funnel most if not all of their 401(k)s into the ETF. “I am going all in,” one said.",2022-10-06 12:45:20

Obviously back then much of hype was centered around dot-com companies like [pets.com](https://pets.com) and [amazon.com](https://amazon.com), but this extended out to tech more broadly (MSFT, INTC, IBM) and even some non-tech names like NKE and KO which fell more than 50% during that period.

Today the hype has been mostly in pandemic names like PTON, ZM and HOOD, but we're now seeing the fall-out extend across tech and into other areas of the market.

I know we're not quite a dot-com levels of pain just yet, but were markets to fall another 10-20% we probably wouldn't be far off them.

Just curious if there are any notable differences between sentiment today and then? Are people more or less hopeful, etc? How do you feel about today compared to then?",2022-10-11 13:15:13

797,"Comcast (CMCSA) - Short-term pain, long-term gain","Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), even if you're not from the USA there's a good chance you've heard about this company before. It's a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable - its broadband segment, NBCUniversal and Sky.

Comcast Cable is the largest and most profitable segment, comprising 53% of 2021 revenue and 76% of 2021 adjusted EBITDA. Comcast Cable is a leading provider of broadband, video (video on demand), voice (VOIP), wireless and other services to residential and business customers in the United States under the ISP brand Xfinity. Comcast achieves a 57% penetration rate among homes and businesses in its cable distribution footprint, which means there is room for growth on its existing network while at the same time being first choice for communications services for a large number of people. It has a total of 34.2 million customers, mainly centered in and around urban centers in the USA (non-rural).

NBCUniversal is the second largest segment (31% of revenue, 18% of adjusted EBITDA with Media being the largest sub-sgement, then Studios, and then Theme Parks). The NBCUniversal business primarly comprises regional, national (USA Network) and international cable networks (CNBC, Telemundo) and owned local broadcast television stations. The Media segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of advertising on the television networks. The Media segment also includes the Direct-to-consumer-streaming platform Peacock, which generates ad revenue and subscription sales.

The Studios business includes film and television studio production and distribution operations. Revenue generation comes from licensing film content to theaters and TV content to other networks. The Theme Parks sub-segment includes the Universal theme parks in Florida, California, Japan and China.

Sky accounts for 16% of revenues and 6% of adjusted EBITDA. Sky is one of Europe's (primarly UK, Italy, Germany) leading entertainment companies mainly for its Sky Sports and Sky News broadcast networks. It also provides video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services as a cable operator. Revenue is generated through direct-to-consumer sales either via the subscription model or the immediate one-time-purchase access ticket (Sky Ticket).

Over time, revenue has been [growing strongly](https://i.imgur.com/Ze0zMBZ.png), achieving a CAGR from 2014 to 2021 of 7.8%. COVID-19 caused 2020 to be a bit of a down year. I make a conservative revenue forecast: 1.5% growth this year, a dip of -2% the next year and then a gradual return to a 3.5% growth rate. This lies far below historical data and is motivated by the following current events:

* General inflationary recession - People will have to make choices as to what to spend their money on and entertainment may well be the first to go.
* Cord cutters - New adds to Comcast's customer base have been very low, near flat. Comcast's Xfinity cable network uses mostly traditional DSL technology. There are alternative technologies available: Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) basically makes use of wireless technology to connect to the internet. I've used this a couple of years ago when I lived in a small rural town and I can tell from experience that this is only for small-time internet users. If you want to stream video, work remotely (video meetings, perhaps large uploads) or want to game, this tech is not a suitable replacement. Another alternative technology is Fibre to the home (FTTH). This is a more expensive but also more performant technology. Considering the inflation recession ahead, the DSL-based tech of Comcast's Xfinity may be the perfect middle ground between a fast-enough and stable internet connection, e.g. for remote work, while also being relatively affordable.
* Advertisement meltdown - Like the tech giants Meta, Snap, Google/Alphabet, Comcast also generates some revenue through advertisements. When aggregate ad spend gets cut, Comcast will also notice this, although not to the extent of the aforementioned.

As a result, some short-term uncertainty and perhaps pain lies ahead.

Expenses mainly derive from production and licensing of original or supplemental content for its broadcast and streaming networks, including sports licensing (e.g. broadcasting rights to the Olympics in 2021, Formula 1 in the UK and Germany, Cricket in the UK, Soccer in Italy). There are also expenses pertaining to the Theme Park business (esp. labor and cost of goods sold) as well as costs for the broadband and cable business, including procurement of settop-boxes and the like. Overall, both operating margins as well as net margins have been [relatively stable over time](https://i.imgur.com/aHBJr1S.png). I forecast that margins remain approximately as they were, with a small dip for the coming years to represent the inflationary recession we may well be heading into.

Capital expenditures have been mostly predictable, growing steadily. The cable communications segment is the main driver of CapEx and no major bumps are expected at the moment.

The company has relatively high debt (2.88x leverage ratio on EBITDA), however, almost all of its debt is fixed at the low interest rates of the previous years and very long-term (>10 years). This insulates the company from interest rate risk to a certain extent. However, if the company decides to roll-over maturing debt by refinancing at the now higher rates, this will cause some pain. Luckily, the company's management has all available options open to them: [Cashflows have been strong](https://i.imgur.com/ZmJCRqw.png), which means the company can either focus on retaining some cash to pay down debt without refinancing, or it can continue to return cash to shareholders through either dividend increases or share buybacks.

Apropos returns to shareholders: The company's track record in this regard has been stellar. The current dividend yield lies at 3.48%, owing to the share price taking a dive the this year (down 39% YTD). The company's share buybacks have also been strong, resulting in a -2.14% CAGR of shares outstanding in the last 10 years.

Using the assumptions on revenue growth and margins discussed above, which in my opinion are quite conservative, I come to an [average valuation of $37.42 per share](https://i.imgur.com/oOSzPfR.png). Compared to the current stock price of $31.00, this represents a price-appreciation upside of 20%. The main risks lie in the short-term risk factors, but they may well turn out to be less big of a deal than currently expected by market participants.

What do you think? Have you been eyeing Comcast as well, or do you think there are major problems with the company?",2022-11-05 09:41:00

799,Nasdaq $RGC CEO Figuratively Putting His Money Where His Mouth Is," 

By [Beth Senko, CFA](https://scr.zacks.com/analyst-bios/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=b8877843-0e4b-47b2-895e-10adc4acf236)

NASDAQ:RGC

Investors have faced challenging and volatile markets so far in 2022 as they sort through issues of inflation, supply chain disruption, continued covid issues, rising interest rates, and the disruption of the war in Ukraine. The S&P 500 has come close to bear market levels, down 19% in mid-June.

Times of turbulence affect all stocks, large and small. It can be particularly challenging for pre-revenue microcap stocks, where the volatility is often magnified by small changes in perception, whether driven by news or technical trading signals.

We first wrote on Regencell Bioscience (NASDAQ:RGC) and its preliminary trials for ASD/ADHD, in [November 2021](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2021/RGC-Traditional-Chinese-Medicine-Approach-for-treatment-of-neurodevelopmental-conditions/default.aspx). At that time, the stock was trading around $20/share. It rose to $40 by mid-February 2022, before dropping back to the low 20s in early April.

While the overall markets continue to be weak, RGC’s share price has performed well since April. Shares have since recovered to the high-$30s to $40. In our view, RGC’s recent share price recovery stems from encouraging study results for Regencell’s RGC-COV19TM Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula for treating COVID-19 symptoms, frequent shareholder communication, and support for the shares in the market.

***Management’s commitment to meet Regencell’s strategic goals***

Founded in 2014, Hong Kong-based Regencell Bioscience is an early clinical stage bioscience company using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach to develop standardized TCM formulas to holistically treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, and infectious diseases which affects the immune system such as COVID-19.

The formulae candidates aim to address the fundamental causes of disorders while alleviating symptoms and improving overall health at the same time. Taking a holistic approach, RGC’s TCM uses natural ingredients to treat different elements in the body and every bodily function is taken into consideration when preparing the TCM formulae for patients.

Unlike some early-stage companies, where it can be difficult to parse the many ways in which founders and executives may benefit whether or not the company succeeds, RGC has taken a more transparent approach that is well-aligned with shareholders’ long-term interests.

• **Chairman and CEO support.** Since RGC’s incorporation in October 2014 up to the IPO, the Company has been fully funded by its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yat-Gai Au.

◦ Upon the IPO, the Chairman’s loan of USD $3.25 million, was converted into \~342,000 common shares at the initial offering price of USD $9.50.

◦ Pledged to not draw salary and bonus of more than USD $1 until the Company reaches USD $1 billion market capitalization;

◦ Will not award share options for himself;

◦ Since the IPO, RGC’s Chairman and CEO has purchased over USD $5 million in common shares on the open market. Most recently, he purchased [49,010 shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001829667/000121390022026630/ea160018-13da4regen_regen.htm) (\~ USD $1.1 million) between April 1 and May 16, 2022, bringing his ownership to 81% of outstanding shares (\~10.5 million).

• **Billionaire investor backing.** Samuel Chen, a successful early Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) investor is one of the major backers of RGC. Last reported 13G filing shows he holds a 7.63% stake in the company.

• **Stock option lock-up extended.** All directors and employees who were previously granted stock options upon the Company’s IPO have agreed to a further lock-up undertaking for a period of six months after their stock options become vested. As their stock options are set to vest on July 16, 2022, their shares will remain locked up until January 16, 2023.

• **Royalties.** Under the agreement with their strategic partner and TCM practitioner, Mr. Sik-Kee Au, creator of the original TCM formulae that form the basis of RGC’s intellectual property, RGC will pay 3% of net revenue, which will in turn be donated to charitable institutions/trusts at the choice of the TCM Practitioner.

***Recent news and upcoming catalysts***

On May 18, 2022, RGC announced a follow-on study of its investigational liquid formula RGC-COV19TM in the elimination for COVID-19 symptoms ([EARTH-B Trial](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2022/RGC-Second-investigational-study-of-RGC-COV19-replicates-results-of-earlier-trial-in-eliminating-COVID-19-symptoms.-/default.aspx)). The follow-on study built on the promising results reported in the first EARTH trial ([EARTH-A Trial](https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2022/RGC-Regencell-Bioscience---Investigational-Liquid-Formula-RGC-COV19-shows-promise-in-eliminating-COVID-19-symptoms/default.aspx)), conducted in 2020-2021. Across the two trials, 95.5% of subjects (n=81), reported complete symptom alleviation within six days following treatment, (except for loss or reduce of sense of smell and/or taste (Sensory Dysfunction) or occasional cough).

In the next few months, RGC expects to report data from its second clinical study of its standardized TCM formula for the treatment of ASD and ADHD.

Regencell Bioscience’s first clinical trial was designed to establish benchmarks for treatment, dosing, adverse effects (AEs) and measuring patient response in a systematic and repeatable way. The study, conducted in 2018-2019, included seven adolescents, aged five to eleven, with professionally-diagnosed ASD or ADHD. After discontinuing any current therapies and medication, subjects received a customized version of the TCM formula for up to three months. Patients’ responses were measured through parental interviews and four validated assessment instruments including the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS), Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale (VADRS) and Pelham (SNAP)-IV 26-item Parent Rating Scale (SNAP-IV-26). All seven patients showed a lessening of symptoms during the treatment period across all four scales.

The second clinical study evaluates response to three standardized mixtures of the TCM formula (for mild, moderate and severe impairment) on children in the same age group. The study design calls for twice daily dosing for three to 12 months, weekly practitioner meetings and monthly assessments. The results will be used to file for proprietary Chinese medicine (pCm) registration in Hong Kong making the product available to for sale in other clinics as well as over the counter.

Regencell is focused on its clinical studies in order to corroborate its results. These efforts will lead to the building of manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure required to gain pCm registration. Regencell Bioscience has a four-year timeframe to commercialize its standardized formulations and gain pCm registration in Hong Kong. The Company has a number of tasks ahead:

• Completing its second clinical trial and evaluating results.

• Conducting additional clinical trials to support its proprietary formulae in ASD/ADHD and other applications.

• Obtaining patents and other forms of IP protection in Hong Kong and other markets.

• Establishing manufacturing capability and supply chain that will meet registration requirements.

• Assembling and filing documentation for pCm approval.

• Build out its marketing and distribution strategy and infrastructure.

RGC’s steady share price ascension in recent weeks may be a sign of greater things to come as its moves towards commercialization, we are encouraged by its thoughtful, systematic approach to developing its therapies, and communicating its progress to shareholders.

800,Keeping things in perspective,"I was reviewing my portfolio, and was feeling pretty down by its performance.  Before I do, I like to keep the returns of the indices in mind. It is the only for me to determine whether my methods are still working or not. Just so you know, I invest only in equities, including gold mining, REITs, and hedging ETFs. I do not invest in bonds, but I will keep some cash on hand in case there is an opportunity too good to pass.  Thank you Elon Musk for the nice little Twitter bonus. I also use covered calls with one year contracts to enhance my income. I only rebalance and reassess the third Friday in January. That keeps me from being totally reactive to market gyrations.

Based on total return, the S&P 500 is down -15.1% this year. The Vanguard Total Bond Fund is down -15.69% this year. If that holds up, it would be an example proving that this is the worst year for bonds since 1793 (yes, you read that right). 

So far this year, I am only down 11%.  I know that is not something to write home about, but I will write it down here, it does give me faith that what I did work. The key is focus on quality companies that generate growing revenues, increasing profits, and have strong balance sheets.  I do use some literal calculus to determine a fair present value, so I don't overpay on my holdings.

801,Learning how to calculate intrinsic value,"Hi,  


I really am new to this and am vastly lost. In all the videos and explanations its always so vague for me and I do not get what people are doing. English is also not my first language and with this very specific financial lingo it really is hard for me to comprehend.  
Where do people get these financial statements? In most videos they just have them but they never show where exactly they are getting these. I used some links for sites on other places but the statements I find there are NEVER even anything close to what is shown in these youtube videos.  


Where exactly is the information I want on these statements? They often just have the numbers for calculations but never show what line on the statement that is or how it could be called if other words are used.  


I have been trying to calculate some intrinsic value of some companies but I did not suceed once in about 20 hours of trying it out. Not even came close to having the feeling I was doing anything right.  
I have watched tons of videos and read tons of articles but I do not understand anything if I can't use that theoretical knowledge to work on practical examples.  


Is there a video or tutorial where someone calculates intrinsic value step by step showing it exactly where he gets the information, where to click on these sites, where the line with the important information is in the statement and so on. I really need a Dummy version here.",2022-11-12 04:45:37

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 21st, 2022.

# **S&P 500 closes higher on Friday, but ends week with losses - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> The major averages ticked higher in afternoon trading Friday to end the day on an upbeat note as investors assessed tougher language from Federal Reserve speakers and pored over the latest earnings reports.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.37 points, or 0.59%, to 33,745.69, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.48% to 3,965.34. The Nasdaq Composite finished just 0.01% above the flat line at 11,146.06.
*****
> All of the major averages posted losses for the week. The Dow ended 0.01% lower. The S&P 500 lost 0.69% for the week, while the Nasdaq ended 1.57% lower. All three indexes are positive for the month, however.
*****
> The market was divided for much of the day, with the S&P 500 trading mostly flat as investors started to reset expectations after a couple of rallies over the past week, beginning with the October CPI print. Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, said this week is characterized by a “back-to-reality viewpoint.”
*****
> “Following the big rally coming off the better-than-expected CPI print, the market’s digesting the current data, which is bringing things back to reality,” she said. “The rally that followed the CPI print we don’t feel was justified by fundamentals… The market’s also pricing in a soft landing here, which we don’t think is likely to occur. So when you hear the Fed officials coming out and reiterating their stance, you’re starting to see the market readjust to that.”
*****
> On Friday, Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins expressed confidence that policymakers can tame inflation without doing too much damage to employment.
*****
> St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” He suggested that the appropriate zone for the federal funds rate could be in the 5% to 7% range, which is higher than what the market is pricing.
*****
> ""We continue to think investors should place much more emphasis on the actual data and not focus too much on Fed rhetoric (the former will show where inflation is headed while the latter is fixated on where it was),” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge. “That said, investors are tired of battling the Fed’s daily tape bombs and the fear is it may take 2-3 more CPIs for officials to stop admonishing the market every time it tries to rally.”

> # Do Stocks Really Like Gridlock?

> The midterm elections are over, and the results aren’t 100% official yet, but we do know that we’ll have a divided government. As of now, the Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate to maintain control there, while the Republicans gained their 218th seat in the House to take control there. The bottom line though is neither the Senate nor the House has large majorities, in fact, they are both near historically small margins.

> So that’s the big question, do stocks really like gridlock? Of course, things are never this simple, as there are so many other factors that matter to how stocks do, but it sure looks like gridlock could be a tailwind for stocks. Or at the very least, not a major headwind.

> Here’s a chart that shows all the times since 1950 we’ve had a divided government and how the S&P 500 did in those years. The average return for stocks was a very solid 15.7% under a divided government, with only one-year falling significantly back in 1981, while 2011 was nearly exactly breakeven. The other years saw some solid returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-176-800x297.png))**

> As of now, it is expected the Republicans will take a three-seat majority in the House (this could change, but it’ll likely be near this number). This would be the smallest majority for the Republicans since 3 seats in 2001 and 2002. Here’s a great chart that shows just how rare it is to have a majority this small. Fun stat, the House moved to 435 seats in 1913, meaning 218 seats gives a party the majority. Fun stat #2, the Democrats controlled the House from 1955 to 1994, but things have been more even over recent years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-2-800x357.png))**

> What exactly does a small-seat majority in the House mean? Odds are a small majority means there could be some gridlock, so do stocks like this? Below we show again this appears to be the case. When there is less than a 20-seat House majority, the S&P 500 gained a median of 19.5% and was higher 12 out of 15 times when looking at the first year of a new Congress. In fact, 9 of the past 10 times there was a new Congress and a small majority, stocks finished higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-3-800x485.png))**

> In conclusion, stocks really do appear to have no issues with a divided government and in many cases, stocks have done just fine under this scenario.

> The recent 21-year typical November graph here points to a seasonal cycle low point tomorrow, the 14th trading day of the month, the Friday before Thanksgiving and Op-Ex day. Thanksgiving week has a notorious “holiday fueled” bullish bias as do the last seven trading days of the month.

> However, as you can see from the tables here of the history of the Thanksgiving trade the bullish bias has weakened over the last several years. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness in the week or days before the holiday and selling any subsequent rally toward the end of Thanksgiving week or before month-end.

> First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&P 500 decline was in 1964. Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 35 years since 1987, there have been 10 declines and 25 advances. See 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac page 106 for more.

> # Highest Bullish Sentiment of the Year

> As we noted last week, this week's sentiment data is the first to encapsulate any reaction to last week's CPI number as well as the subsequent market rally. Although price action has been somewhat choppy and there have been plenty of other catalysts (FTX's collapse, more yield curve inversions, the missile strike in Poland) to balance out the inflation data and put investors back onto their heels, the latest AAII survey has shown a surge in bullish sentiment. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic jumped from 25.1% last week up to 33.5% this week. That is not only the largest one-week increase since the first week of June (when bulls rose by 12.2 percentage points) but is now the highest reading on bulls since the last week of 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-1.png))**

> Bearish sentiment in turn dropped sharply falling to 40.2% for a decline of 6.8 percentage points. While an improvement, at the start of the month bearish sentiment had fallen by much more (both the last week of October and the first week of November saw double-digit week-over-week declines) and was at a much lower level of 32.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-2.png))**

> The bull-bear spread has narrowed but still remains negative for the 33rd week in a row. If the spread remains negative into next week, it will tie the record streak from 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-3.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-6.png))**

> Neutral sentiment fell for a second week in a row with the total decline in that time eclipsing 10 percentage points. At 26.3%, it is down to the lowest level since the week of October 20th, implying that investors have become a bit more decisive in their respective market views.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-4.png))**

> The AAII survey's more bullish turn this week was also seen in other readings on sentiment like the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index. As a result, our sentiment composite which aggregates the findings of the three surveys into a single sentiment reading is back up to its highest reading since mid-August. Although the reading remains negative, it is no longer at the extreme levels that were common earlier this year.

> Ranging from today's retail sales report to homebuilder sentiment to the earnings of some of the largest retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW), the economic and earnings calendar this week has given Consumer Discretionary stocks plenty of news to digest. Outside of the spring to late summer, the sector has generally been on the decline relative to the S&P 500 in 2022. Last week, that relative strength line bounced right as it reached the late May low. However, over the past few days, it has been resuming its move lower, meaning it is back to underperforming.

> While on a sector level the relative strength line has been falling, drilling down to the industry group level, there has been more variation. For example, even with some positive responses to earnings from the likes of Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW), the retailing industry has seen a sharp grind lower in its relative strength line versus the S&P 500. Similarly, autos have seen a turn lower although it has been underperforming the S&P for a longer period of time since the early fall. Meanwhile, Consumer Durables and Appliances (which includes stocks like the homebuilders and home appliance makers) has been moving higher. That move has paled in comparison to the relative strength of Consumer Services stocks (restaurants, cruise lines, hotels and resorts), though, as that group's line has surged over the past couple of months.

> As mentioned above, retailers in the Consumer Discretionary sector have been underperforming the S&P 500 lately but there is another group of retailers in which performance has been more solid. The Food & Staples Retail industry is a component of the Consumer Staples sector, and its relative strength line has been trending higher since the spring lows. In fact, after the past week's move higher thanks in part to a strong response to Walmart (WMT) earnings, its relative strength line is approaching some of the highest levels of the past year, entirely recovering the massive drop from May in the wake of another, much more negatively received, WMT earnings report.

> # How Bottoms Form. (It Might Surprise You.)

> The S&P 500 rallied again last week and was more than 10% off the October 12 closing lows, before selling off some yesterday. Nonetheless, the truth is the overall news really hasn’t really been that great, yet stocks have staged a strong rally over the past month. What gives?

> Turns out, this is what tends to happen coming off major lows for stocks more often than not. Our friends at JPM Asset Management put together some of the best charts I’ve ever seen to describe this phenomenon. You can read the whole report from Michael Cembalest here.

> They found that from the Eisenhower recession in 1957 to stagflation in the 1970s, to the early 1980s double dip recession, to the 1990 recession, stocks turned higher well before the other parts of the economy began to turn higher. As you can see below, stocks tended to bottom months (and sometimes years) before earnings, GDP, and payrolls officially turn higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-166-800x527.png))**

> More recently we saw similar action during the Financial Crisis and then again during the worst of COVID. I’ll never forget how stocks soared in April, May, and June of 2020, yet we saw some of the very worst headlines in our country’s history. The truth is the stock market isn’t looking in the rear-view mirror, it is always looking forward and discounting what could be out there in the future.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-245-800x257.png))**

> To keep things honest, this doesn’t have a perfect track record, as, after the dot-com burst, GDP and earnings both turned higher well before stocks officially bottomed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-34.png))**

> This in one of the more confusing concepts for many investors, but it is one that is so important to understand. Stocks will likely rise even as the news is bad, this is how it works. If you are waiting for things to officially improve, you likely will miss out on substantial gains along the way.

> Burt White likes to say if you are playing a video game and you are going toward the monsters, you are going in the right direction. Investing is similar, as times will sometimes be extra scary, but this is part of the process. If you are scared or uncomfortable, that is all part of investing in a lot of ways and if you run the other way every time things get scary, you’ll likely never be able to meet your investment goals.

> # Homebuilder Hopes Demolished

> The national average on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has come back below 7%, but it remains elevated versus recent history as housing data still can't catch a break. This morning, the NAHB released their latest reading on homebuilder sentiment and for the eleventh month in a row, the headline index fell month over month. As shown below, the current streak of nearly a year straight of declines is far and away a record, surpassing two eight-month long streaks leading up to the Financial Crisis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1a.png))**

> This month, homebuilder sentiment dropped another 5 points down to 33. That is not the largest drop of the current streak of declines, with bigger drops of 8 points last month or 12 points in July, but it still ranks in the bottom 4% of all months on record. In other words, not only is homebuilder sentiment falling consistently, but it's falling fairly fast. The other components have also seen bottom decile declines with the only sub-index avoiding declines being in the West.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-2.png))**

> After the November decline, the headline homebuilder sentiment reading sits 3 points above the spring 2020 low. Similarly, Present Sales and Traffic are down to the lowest level since April 2020 while Future Sales have actually surpassed those levels to now sit at the weakest reading in over a decade.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1.png))**

> Last month, we highlighted how the geographic breakdown of sentiment was showing homebuilders in the Northeast being much more optimistic than their counter parts in the rest of the country. In November, that region joined the rest of the pack with a massive 17 point decline. That ranks as the third largest monthly decline on record behind a 19 point drop in June 2010 and the 45 point decline at the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. While that has not been enough to result in a new low, similar to sentiment in the Midwest, sentiment in the South is down to the lowest level in a decade. The same could be said for the West although it rose marginally month over month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-3.png))**

> As for the reaction of homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) is trading 1.1% lower as of this writing. As shown below, after last week's equity market surge on CPI in which the group moved not only above its 50-DMA but also its 200-DMA, ITB has continued to hold above its moving averages for now. Without much follow through on the post-CPI surge, any move above last week's highs would be a welcome bullish sign, whereas the 200-DMA is looking to be the critical level of support for the time being.

807,"My Full Plan for this Week 11/21 + Challenge Update (3 Earnings Plays, 1 MAJOR Economic Event , 4 Stocks)","Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**

Last week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.

For Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays.

Our 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.

For those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014**Port % Change:** 1001%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918**Port % Change**: 102%

And plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so they pulled the account value down, i got alot of time on most of these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on.

We got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much.

# Major Economic Events

**Wednesday 11/09**

8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct9:45 AM S&P PMI Flash Nov2:00 PM FOMC Minutes

As i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.

# Earnings

# Monday 21 Nov

**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**

* Technology Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.832 & Revenue $1.09B
* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.

# Tue 22 Nov

**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**

* Retail Trade
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.032 & Revenue $10.3B
* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings
* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell

# Wed 22 Nov

**Before Open - Deere & Company ($DE)**

* Industrial
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $7.12 & Revenue $13.5B
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.

Other notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

Right at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok

https://preview.redd.it/5b822iml471a1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=38224844d423153947961785b69b9262b1578b9d

**- META Long**

Holding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this

**- TSLA Long/Short**

At major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering

**- COIN Long**

Crypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls

https://preview.redd.it/gs9pibln471a1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89d825bbcdbee23ada46186c402839c2621d4a10

**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**

No 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

I wish you all a very green week!",2022-11-20 19:11:50

809,The Billionaires in this Timeline Suck!!!,"We have some of the Worst Billionaires imaginable. 

As Elon Musk spends 44 Billion Dollars on buying Twitter so he can *""create the town square of the internet""* (shitpost), I am left wondering how spending that money helps get us to mars? - or helps propel Tesla(sucks to be a shareholder rn) and the EV market?

I often day dream of a Universe where our billionaires create and launch IPOs for Biotech Companies Like INGEN. Why cant we have a John Hammond instead of a Jeff Bezos?

A place where our Billionaires invest in making Sabretooth Tigers and Mammoths instead of trying to make VR a thing.  Fuck all these Non-Dinosaur-Making billionaires. They are ruining peoples hopes and dreams. 

[What a real Billionaire Looks Like](https://preview.redd.it/fv1prfv0rd1a1.jpg?width=4780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1fd7f522c3bd8ea6e3f993eef22786ecb3c7f656)

Instead the money gets spent on fake ass space gliding trips that nobody gives a fuck about and nobody will ever really spend money on. VR headsets. AND TWITTER. What a fucking waste of money.

TLDR - Make Billionaires John Hammond (still working on the wording/acronym) - Give the Little People of the World a Stock to rally behind - Biotech Dino-Genetics Reanimation.

ZM is such a prime example of that. this post really made me think about sara's refusal to be respectful towards many minority groups (lgbtq+ comes to mind) despite being called out on it, mostly respectfully, over and over again. really says a lot about her character. so mad i didn't notice this until recently.

814,Zoom Can't Keep Up Past Growth,"It was another rough financial earnings release for Zoom (Nasdaq: ZM), with shares dropping by 6.74% in after-hours trading on Monday.

Financials: Zoom reported earnings of $1.07 per share and revenue of $1.1 billion; both were better than expected.

Enterprising: Revenue for Zoom’s enterprise business grew 20% in the quarter.

Going Slow: Overall revenue went up 5%, which actually represents slower growth than last year. It would have been higher for Zoom if not for the impact of foreign currency. Also, online revenue declined by 9%.

Outlook: Zoom expects revenue to be between $1.095 billion and $1.105 billion in the current quarter, which is lower than what analysts expected.

Stock Price: Shares of Zoom are down 56% this year, but are mostly flat in the last 30 days.

Final Thoughts: Zoom was a darling stock pick during the pandemic, but it is now struggling to keep up the same growth. There are a lot of positives, but some investors were expecting more.

815,From Inflation to Recession: Part 2 - puts on industrials for generational wealth,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yy6z01/from_inflation_to_recession_why_i_am_all_in_on/)

**Introduction**

The industrials sector is heavily levered up to the economy and has typically followed the economic cycle. That said, it is currently dislocated from key statistics such as the ISM Manufacturing Index as markets rotate away from the tech sector and into other areas. This presents an extremely attractive shorting opportunity as all signs point to further economic deterioration. December 1 is the next ISM Manufacturing report and we believe it will mark a massive turning point for many names in the industrials space. 

**ISM Manufacturing and XLI (Industrials ETF)**

* For those who do not know, the ISM Manufacturing Index is a monthly indicator of US economic activity based on a survey of more than 300 manufacturing firms. It is seen as a key indicator for the state of the US economy and has historically been a great indicator for stocks within the industrials sector. 

* [Here](https://i.imgur.com/O5YUGI4.png) you can clearly see the relationship between XLI and the ISM Manufacturing Index. You can also see that there is a massive discrepancy building up over the last several months as the ISM Manufacturing continues to fall lower, but the share price of XLI increases over time.  

* There is a lot of focus around Dec 1, the next ISM report, as many indicators suggest that it will fall lower, below the critical 50 level. In addition to the index's correlation to the general economy, the [Philly Fed] (https://i.imgur.com/yy5VH8Q.png), [US Industrial Production](https://i.imgur.com/FWU8Mnj.png), [GDP](https://i.imgur.com/tMLjHzj.png), and many more all suggest that the ISM index has more to fall. 

**Here's the part where you make money**

* [HON](https://i.imgur.com/0aN2Sns.png), [EMR](https://i.imgur.com/wGflZmV.png), and [ITW](https://i.imgur.com/5HPGvx9.png) are my preferred ways to play the next ISM report. They show some of the biggest discrepancies versus the ISM index and most of their price returns were from multiple expansion and not any increase in earnings expectations. In fact, all three companies are now sitting near their all time high's despite having their earnings estimates lowered in recent months. [ITW](https://i.imgur.com/CBjDI7n.png) [HON](https://i.imgur.com/mIFvzgK.png) [EMR](https://i.imgur.com/R09b47x.png)

* Now how does that make any sense? **The sector sees lower earnings expectations next year given its cyclical nature, yet the stocks are now close to their all time highs even as a major reading for economic health is set to report badly.** 

* It is clear that these industrial names have strayed too far, too fast.  Once the next ISM report on Dec 1 paints a much more bleak outlook for the economy, these stocks will inflect lower - much lower - as reality sets in. 

**Here's what you buy**

* The key date is December 1, but you can buy puts further out. As the economy will get worse and worse as time goes on, the likelihood of your puts cashing in will skyrocket. However, for those who are aiming for generational scale wealth, time your puts as close to December 1 as possible. 

* Note that there is the risk that the December 1 ISM report won't be as bad as hoped! For those who are risk averse, consider pushing your expiry date out further to March or June. 

Good luck and happy trading to all!",2022-11-22 19:07:02
816,Is $ZM a fading company?,"&#x200B;

**Is $ZM a fading company?**

$ZM stock is now at its lowest since Jan 2020.

The company was issued in April 2019 at the price of **62$** a stock in **NASDAQ**, reached its highest during COVID in 2020 at a stock price of **588$**, and since then made a decline to its current price of **77$.**

$ZM was founded in 2011 and launched in 2013 by Eric Yuan, a former Cisco engineer and executive. The company offers Zoom meetings via video, voice, and chats. The company makes working through a call or chat easy and accessible through the app’s special features, enabling sharing of images, videos, audio files, and content on a desktop or a laptop.

$ZM started to accelerate when COVID hit, providing an effective and accessible way to continue working, studying, and hosting events online through lockdowns.

The company also provides Zoom Contact Centre, Zoom App Marketplace, and Zoom Developer platform.

**So what happened to $ZM?**

Maybe it’s the company struggling to adapt to a non-pandemic reality. Or maybe there are competitors with greater name recognition that gives them an advantage in the field.

With $ZM growth many competitors entered the game like Google meets and even META. These are huge companies with a large user base community.

&#x200B;

* $ZM has a market cap of 23.89B
* $ ZM revenue in the last year increased by 5% from a year earlier in a compartment to a year earlier that had a 35% growth, and in 2020 that had 366% growth
* Debt /Equity ratio 1.36 which is high for an asset-light company.
* Price to free cash flow is 17.95

Taking into account her competitors, her decline, and her statistics I would not recommend purchasing $ZM.

818,Is $ZM a fading company?," **Is $ZM a fading company?**

$ZM stock is now at its lowest since Jan 2020.

The company was issued in April 2019 at the price of **62$** a stock in **NASDAQ**, reached its highest during COVID in 2020 at a stock price of **588$**, and since then made a decline to its current price of **77$.**

$ZM was founded in 2011 and launched in 2013 by Eric Yuan, a former Cisco engineer and executive. The company offers Zoom meetings via video, voice, and chats. The company makes working through a call or chat easy and accessible through the app’s special features, enabling sharing of images, videos, audio files, and content on a desktop or a laptop.

$ZM started to accelerate when COVID hit, providing an effective and accessible way to continue working, studying, and hosting events online through lockdowns.

The company also provides Zoom Contact Centre, Zoom App Marketplace, and Zoom Developer platform.

**So what happened to $ZM?**

Maybe it’s the company struggling to adapt to a non-pandemic reality. Or maybe there are competitors with greater name recognition that gives them an advantage in the field.

With $ZM growth many competitors entered the game like Google meets and even META. These are huge companies with a large user base community.

* $ZM has a market cap of 23.89B
* $ ZM revenue in the last year increased by 5% from a year earlier in a compartment to a year earlier that had a 35% growth, and in 2020 that had 366% growth
* Debt /Equity ratio 1.36 which is high for an asset-light company.
* Price to free cash flow is 17.95

Taking into account her competitors, her decline, and her statistics I would not recommend purchasing $ZM.

Would you invest in $ZM?",2022-11-23 08:49:02
819,"My Full Plan for this Week 11/28 + Challenge Update (4 Earnings Plays, 3 MAJOR Economic Event , 3 Stocks + 10x Lotto)","Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm ash and i write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

Last week was almost Perfect, we almost got everything on the watchlist right on the money, no one can get all their plays perfectly obviously so the weeks where we do is cause for celebration at least for me.

For Earnings, we had $ZM puts, $DE puts, and $BBY calls. All ran in the direction we hoped for 100%-200% plays, except DE.

As for economic plays, we only had FOMC minutes and as expected, we got a little pump. I have zero clue why anyone on Twitter and Reddit would be bearish on minutes for a meeting that already happened and we say a dovish statement for. But each to his own, we made our $$$.

For those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $11,162  
**Port % Change:** 1101%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

We also had call swings for AMD, AFRM, COIN, NFLX, TQQQ, SPX, TSLA, and TWST Puts.

Cashed in TWST puts for 20%, TSLA 25th calls for 50%, and SPX calls for 110% as these were close to expiring 1-2 weeks out.

Averaged down on NFLX, and AFRM, and added TSLA March ‘23 swing.

As we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash, I'm still bullish (ill explain why later on), but not willing to risk a lot of $$ on that.

So overall we got more cash, and more positions, but NFLX dragging us down a bit so yeah still around the 11k mark, so I currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C
* TSLA 03/17/2022 220.00 C

Man last week was sleepy but this week is FULL of data, SUPER IMPORTANT data as well. Jobs numbers, PMI, and Inventories will all be important this week, but we will focus on a few major plays here.

**GDP Q3**

So we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter.

This month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession.

With USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts

**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**JPow Speech**

JPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows.

A lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.

I think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient.

**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**PCE**

Now we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

I'm still long NFLX as long as it holds the upward trendline, if I see a clear failure of the line, will be exiting my position, but if it holds, will add more. From a structural standpoint, we are putting in a higher low.

**- AAPL Long**

Has been beasting for this month, and currently forming a bull flag on the daily chart, as long as it holds the 50MA, ill be taking a long position with the 200MA as my target

https://preview.redd.it/dvy6evpymo2a1.jpg?width=1528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88379fd4c3b5116b628a63a10a66bd325c5d3b93

**- TSLA Long**  
We got TSLA on the way up and down last week, we have a lot of bullish catalysts for TSLA till the end of the year, so I'm going long here, as long as we hold $166, which was the low of last week

https://preview.redd.it/mstw3cizmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bde9f56032ea57f69a8d861020a8d7c4bb16b0a6

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

My 10x play was VIX calls, which is a super obvious play given everything going in the market today, but its already up 9% at the time of writing this, we may still see 24-25 (21MA on Daily) as we progress throught the week, and it's extremely oversold. The R:R is not so great anymore for calls, but it's your call if you want to play it to 24ish level, it's still a 10%+ move.

I’ll start by taking a 12/30 23c to play to 21MA on daily, if my assumptions for events are wrong ill just keep riding this 1 - 2 week out to expiry.

If my assumptions are correct with this week’s events, ill be taking profits on VIX calls and i’ll be taking VIX puts at a 24ish level, and riding it all the way down to new 52-week lows. Play here would be 12/20 23p

https://preview.redd.it/xr65x390no2a1.jpg?width=1528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=74f5692199b20cf24dbd4499aabf65419c9ca201

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

I wish you all a very green week!",2022-11-28 07:06:51

Yesterday's low was near the previous intensive trading area which I think traders maybe like to long.

Plan: Long around $169.4, stop loss at $167.7, target to $173, risk-reward ratio is 1:2.

Second one 

ZM Long

https://preview.redd.it/wadc2gm0tm5a1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=428681584f158701edd25591ca279f384bd7573e

From weekly chart, ZM is closed to mid-long terms support around $62.

From 15-minutes chart, ZM broke the left high, short-term uptrend established.

Plan: Long around $73, stop loss at $70, if ZM continue to go up at open, I’ll change stop loss to $72.3, target to $77.

Third one

LULU Long

https://preview.redd.it/1aklbq85tm5a1.png?width=1761&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d8d783c84db733e4f57ad59601742c4d8dc11896

Due to earnings, LULU drops sharply. It’s a hammer, support obtained near the 200 SMA. And LULU extended from 8&21 equilibrium, I think it will be price correction.

Plan: Long around $326, stop loss at $321, target to $340, risk-reward ratio is 1:3.

If at opening stock price falls quickly below the stop loss or opens directly below the stop loss point, abandon the plan.

That’s all for today’s trading plan. Welcome to discuss, and leave your option!

824,"Cathie Wood of ARK Invest bought 74,862 shares of Tesla today worth around around $11.7 million","Elon Musk fan Cathie Wood seized a sizable chunk of Tesla stock (TSLA) late Wednesday after the stock extended a recent skid to its lowest level in more than two years.

ARK Invest, Wood’s investment management firm, snapped up 74,862 shares of the electric-vehicle maker across three of her exchange-traded funds, according to a daily transaction report sent via email. The purchase was valued around $11.7 million, based on Wednesday’s closing price of $156.80.

The snap-up by ARK also comes after Tesla's own chief executive officer Elon Musk sold approximately 21,995,000 shares of the company, or roughly $3.6 billion worth, during the three-day period ending Dec. 14, a regulatory filing showed after Wednesday's close.

ARK’s Tesla buy comprised 61,537 shares for the ARK Innovation fund (ARKK), 10,066 for the ARK Autonomous Tech. & Robotics ETF (ARKQ), and 3,259 for the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). Tesla is the third largest holding among ARK’s suite of investment products after Zoom Communications (ZM) and Exact Sciences (EXAS).

Wood's dip-buying spree comes during a difficult month amid a difficult year for Tesla as concerns intensify among investors that Musk as CEO diverted his attention away from the company to manage Twitter, the social media platform he recently acquired in a $44 billion take-private deal.

Tesla stock is down more than 19% in December so far and roughly 55% year-to-date. ARK's flagship ARK Innovation fund (ARKK) is down around 13% this month and 64% on the year.
