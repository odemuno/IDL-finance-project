SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shops, restaurants and cinemas may be deserted in many parts of virus-plagued China, but online trading forums, internet roadshows and analyst calls are teeming with investors who have driven up stock trading volumes to nine-month highs.


Strategists are busy meeting anxious investors online to dispense tips on how to trade the coronavirus, while fund managers aggressively pitch products via live video streaming, with face-to-face conferences banned and many offices still closed.

The virus has been a blow to China’s already-slowing economy, prompting Beijing to boost financial support to avoid a deeper hit to economic growth. But with many cities still locked down and people staying home amid efforts to contain an epidemic that has killed more than 1,000, online activity is buzzing.

“The government is injecting liquidity to aid the virus-hit economy,” said Shanghai-based hedge fund manager Li Zhen, who has been trading at home since the outbreak began around the start of the Lunar New Year in late January.

“Loose liquidity, plus a rising willingness to trade, help lift trading turnover.”

Investor enthusiasm is highlighting a long-standing disconnect between China’s stock market and its real economy.

While analysts and government researchers forecast a sharp hit to the country's GDP growth this year, Chinese equities have risen for six consecutive sessions as investors piled in to hunt for bargains following the market's .SSEC 8% plummet on Feb. 3, the first trading session after the new year.

The start-up board ChiNext .CNT has recovered all its losses, hitting a more than three-year-high on Monday, while the Shanghai market last week witnessed its biggest weekly trading volume since April, 2019.

“Investors who missed last year’s bull run are taking advantage of the correction to get onto the ride,” said Huang Wei, a former Wall Street trader who has recently set up a trading forum on China’s WeChat messaging platform that offers paid stock recommendation services to retail investors.

“The virus doesn’t change long-term fundamentals of China’s market, just as the Pearl Harbor incident didn’t change U.S. economic strength,” he said, adding Beijing will likely deliver more stimulus, including rate cuts, to cushion the economic fallout from the virus outbreak.

Membership in Huang's newly established trading forum has grown to more than 100 in just a few days as investors are lured into a market that saw the blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 jump 36% last year.

That trading enthusiasm has spurred local brokerage Huatai Securities into launching a series of conference calls to help investors pick stocks. Companies to be discussed this week include Anhui Honglu Steel Construction (Group) Co (002541.SZ) and China Railway Group (601390.SS).

Robin Lu, an entrepreneur, said making money through stock investing is more promising than doing business under the current environment.

“The real economy is struggling. But in the stock market, there’s a structural bull,” said Lu, who favors technology stocks. His consultancy business has been affected by the virus, which hit many of his clients.

Meanwhile, mutual fund managers are promoting products for investors who don’t want to pick stocks themselves. More than 30 new funds have been launched over the past week, with several snapped up by investors in just a few days.

China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC) launched a week-long online roadshow in which 11 fund managers take turns to introduce fund products and share investment views via live video streaming.

“The impact from the virus is short term and won’t affect long-term investment,” ChinaAMC fund manager Zhou Keping told a live forum on Monday, advising investors to buy into tech-focused funds.

The stock market will benefit from “relatively loose liquidity conditions that will improve risk appetite,” he said.",2020-02-11 07:21:38
1,$AMC either has an insane amount of value or is circling around the drain...what does /r/securityanalysis think?,"$AMC has been beaten down like crazy over the past year (and beyond) to the point that the company has a market cap. of 472.2176 Mil while operating 1,004 theaters and 11,041 screens ([source](https://www.snl.com/Cache/IRCache/cc9a2c53b-ae0a-abb0-237a-aef7493b6775.html) for the latter statement). It also recently had to cut its dividend from $0.12/share to $0.03/share.

At any rate, it seems there is a *lot* of value in this company:

* The company just recently announced a $200 million share buyback // top executives are forgoing their salary and taking stock options, which indicates a bullish sentiment [\(source\)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200227005928/en/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Announces-Quarterly-Dividend-Company) (executives seem bullish on a [comeback/turnaround](https://www.businessinsider.com/amc-entertainments-turnaround-plan-after-stock-price-drop-feature-2020-2))
* Morningstar has the stock listed as trading at 60% undervalued 
* AMC has arguably the best cinema experience available in Dolby Cinema ([source](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-dolby-cinema-at-amc-is-the-best-movie-going-experience-today/))
* There simply isn't much competition in the cinema industry itself due to [consolidation](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/icuyh0oa7pwlpbrdgzxfiq2) (granted, there is a lot from streaming services)

-- Some Devil's Advocate stuff to consider:

* Are streaming services the better investment? Especially now, with Coronavirus, why not just stay home and watch streaming services? (In this case, one might recommend $DIS or $NFLX)
* Is AMC A-List a successful program as far as getting people into theaters? ([800,000 members in May of 2019](https://deadline.com/2019/05/amc-stubbs-a-list-800000-moviepass-members-number-1-subscription-movie-ticket-1202619105/) -- the death of MoviePass made it #1 movie theater subscription)
* The new James Bond movie has been delayed to later in the year due to Coronavirus -- don't be surprised if other big-name movies follow suit [\(source\)](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51744374)
* There are (arguably) no good movies out right now, but it should change by Q3 and pick up by Q4. 
* The big question on everyone's mind right now is: how Coronavirus affects the cinema industry with attendance/markets in general. How does this affect the turnaround plan?

8,Have any major corporations declared bankruptcy yet (or seem like they’re close to declaring) due to the impacts of COVID-19?,"Posted this in r/stocks but thought I’d ask here as well. With the forecasts in earnings and GDP decline, less consumer spending, less demand for goods and services, etc., you would think we’d be hearing about quite a few potential bankruptcies. 

I haven’t seen anything from the news or articles I’ve come across, so thought I’d ask here. Any big companies looking like they won’t make it out of this alive?

Edit: I should mention what triggered this question was the thought that either, A) We haven’t heard about bankruptcies yet because things aren’t as bad as people think, and we’re slowly on the road to recovery, or B) The impacts of lockdown are only starting to be felt and we won’t know the full financial consequences until months down the road. I’m more inclined to believe the latter at this point. But good to get more info so let me know what yall have seen/heard!",2020-04-15 05:54:56
9,Why AMC Entertainment Stock Jumped Today,"""Shares of movie-theater business **AMC Entertainment** ([NYSE:AMC](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/amc-entertainment-holdings/amc/)) jumped on Wednesday, even as the market declined. The entertainment company's stock rose about 10.6% by the time the market closed. Yet the **S&P 500** fell 2.2%.

AMC stock's rise comes even as an analyst lowered his price target for the stock. Bullishness for the company's shares on Wednesday may simply be due to the analyst noting that AMC has a chance of not going bankrupt.""

**GENE**: Big gap up with high volume in the premarket. Worth keeping an eye on out of the gate for sure, but this stock may have seen its high of the day in the premarket.

**ECOR**: Gapping up on a business update. Not the most appealing on the watchlist, but I’ll be keeping an eye on the chart regardless.

**MFA**: Gapping up, relatively unimpressive price swings, but the patterns may be a bit more predictable. Will be watching throughout the day. 

**DNJR**: Gold bull, gapping up with some nice price action in the premarket. Could see some nice price action continued at least throughout the morning, but will want some more volume first.

SPY gapping right into the 50 day moving average. Many times the 50 DMA will act as resistance, hard to say in this market as QQQ moved right though it with ease. Most stocks are gapping with the market as well. We are seeing buying happening before earnings, ROKU had a real strong day yesterday as well as most of big tech names, individual stocks performing well.

**SFET**: Gapping up on earnings. Decent price action and volume in the premarket. Worth keeping an eye on, especially if volume picks up considerably.

**AVCO**: Gapping up on good news for the company. Recent spike in volume in the premarket, worth keeping an eye on until market open.

34,Do you think AMC Theatres can survive the pandemic without going bankrupt?,"[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-reports-22-billion-q1-loss-2020-06-09?mod=mw\_quote\_news](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-reports-22-billion-q1-loss-2020-06-09?mod=mw_quote_news)

I should note that I'm an investing n00b, but I don't see how AMC can survive the pandemic without bankruptcy.  Per the above article, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. reported a Q1 2020 loss of $2.2 billion.  If I remember correctly, shutdowns didn't really start occurring until mid-March, so that means they were operational for 2.5 months, and still losing money. Also,

>""In our two largest territories, we are currently planning to reopen almost all of our U.S. and U.K. theatres in July"" to be ready to show the new film ""Tenet"" that is slated for release on July 17 and ""Mulan,"" the Walt Disney Co. film slated to be released July 24.

That sounds good, but I'm pretty sure that to keep patrons safe, full capacity in theatres will not be allowed until the pandemic is over.  Also, even with heavy cleaning after each movie showing, I'm not sure how many people will be willing to risk the virus to see a movie.  I think there were also several ""big"" movies that were moved from a 2020 release, to 2021 or 2022.

If AMC can come out of this pandemic without bankruptcy, maybe it's worth putting a few dollars in their stock? What are your thoughts?",2020-06-09 18:04:16

39,HELP! Call Option Trading,"Hi Guys so I've purchased 4 AMC $11.45 Call Options contracts expiring on 1/15/2021. I bought the options last year with a $2.35 premium per contract (total $9.4) and on Robinhood, it shows my cost was $940 (I assume it's the total value of stocks at the strike price). Since AMC's stock price dropped so much, I didn't want to exercise/sell it because I thought with a call option I was given a right but not an obligation to exercise it (i.e. I thought if I waited until the option expires, even if the stock price is well below the strike price, I would only lose the premium ($9.4 but not $940). However, after reading some articles published by Robinhood, it says that when my option contract expires, ""the contract itself would become worthless"". I was a little panicked after reading that. Does it mean that if I don't take any actions, when the options expire, I would lose the $940 instead of just the $9.4? (Because currently on my Robinhood account it shows that my AMC option has a market value of only $80 (with $860 loss). Since it's been a week since I emailed Robinhood about this question and no answer has been received, I would be much appreciative if anyone can help me!! Thanks!!",2020-06-26 15:46:25

41,Next Week's Earning Plays,"**Calling the great options brains!**    
 In preparation for next week, I scanned the earnings calendar and I picked 11 stocks based on market cap and options volume.   
Then, I created this sheet where I analysed the previous earnings move of the stocks as well as the expected move from MarketChameleon.   
I, then, adjusted the expected move to reflect the worst-case scenarios.    
After that, I looked at the delta of each lower and higher strike of the expected move range and came up with suggested Iron Condors for some (5 of them). The rest are either too low in profit or wide bid/ask spread.     
**Please note the following:**    
1. The expected move will change in value as the trading week begins. (The sheet has formulas and will update itself).    
2. The delta is based on the last close price. I will have to update that manually as the market opens.   
   
3. I intend on buying ICs (For credit of course) 1-2 hours before the earnings announcements and close the trade at the IV crush. For example, if the earnings are on Tuesday BMO, I will open the trade on Monday (1-2 hours before market close). If the earnings are on Tuesday AMC, I will open the trade on the same day (1-2 hours before market close).    
4. My approach in these ICs is to play it as safe as possible. As a consequence, both max profit and loss are relatively small.  5. Feel free to create an editable copy of this sheet.     


The reason why I'm sharing this sheet is that I value your feedback. **I am by no means encouraging anyone to use these suggested trades** as some values will change as the market opens.

42,"New Investor, I need some clarity.","Hey guys,

I'm a new investor here, and a Canadian.

**A bit of a background:**

I have approximately 57k held in a TFSA account of a big bank, out of which 50k was foolishly deposited into an account because I was able to get free trades during a promo. I haven't touched that 50k and it's just sitting there...The other 7k is in mutual funds and I'm extremely displeased with the returns. I had initially started it back in 2011 and have only got approximately $1k return in the past 9 years!

So, this brings me to today. I found out that we have a free trading platform similar to RobinHood, called Wealthsimple. You can't do much besides buying and selling the traditional way (as far as I'm aware). For instance, you can't buy/sell options, have margin accounts, and if you buy and sell US stocks, you'll have to immediately convert the funds into Canadian dollars as there's no way to keep it in US dollars (Wealthsimple doesn't have a US account yet).

I'm OK with all of this as I know very little about making fancy trades.

Currently, I'm watching some Canadian stocks: Husky Energy and Cenovus Energy (both oil and gas companies), Air Canada, Cineplex (one of our biggest theatre/cinema akin to AMC in the US) and Bombardier. All of these companies took a major hit in mid-March where their stocks plunged.

**What I'm interested in:**

HSE (Husky) and Bombardier are under $5. In fact, Bombardier is under 50c. I'm thinking of investing in Bombardier because even though they're bleeding, they've sold off some of their businesses off (railway to Alstom in France and airplane-manufacturing to Airbus) and are trying to streamline. Secondly, they're one of the biggest employers of Quebec and one of the prominent companies in Canada and part of the country's heritage and pride.

So, this brings me to the next question: I've read in this sub and beyond that when a company declares bankruptcy, a lot of times their stock jumps up for a day or two. Should I try to buy as much stock as possible (for Bombardier) and hope to cash in during the surge?  Secondly, what are the chances that the Canadian government, which has bailed out many large companies numerous times before will let Bombardier sink this time?",2020-07-25 13:16:00
43,"Over 21 months later, here's how /r/investing performed on the underrated stock survey. Inspired by Mr_Suzan and galloog1.","In October of 2018, /u/Mr_Suzan was inspired by a post from /u/galloog1 to seek out underrated stock picks from the /r/investing community and monitor their performance.  


Post-COVID bounce, I wanted to see how these picks have performed, so I've gathered them all here.

A few of these have earnings posting soon, so the ranks may change, but overall it looks like a solid performance by the community.  Any new underrated stocks to think about?  

&nbsp;

# Some quick stats:

- Overall average return: ~33% (compared to ~18% for the S&P 500)

- Equal rated return: ~50% (as pointed out by /u/csp256)

- Return on the most upvoted pick: Disney (DIS) 1%

- Highest returning pick: Enphase (ENPH) 1110% (recommended by /u/williemax)

- If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks, you would have seen a 27% return

- If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks, you would have seen a 99% return

- The top 10 gainers in order were ENPH, TSLA, APT, DXCM, OKTA, AYX, BAND, ALU, WIX, LRCX

- If you had picked one of these stocks at random, you would have had a ~53% chance of >10% gains and a ~19% chance of >100% gains

44,ALERT ON $INPX!!!!!!!! Tell us if you know anything!,"  **PSYCHO ALERT on $INPX!!!!!!!!**

On Friday after market hours, there was some unusual activity in the stock of Inpixon - $INPX. There were 2.4MM shares transacted and price rose 21.5% from closing at $1.39 to $1.69 in after hours. For context, this stock trades a volume of 6MM daily average in last 10 days. 

The next chart is from CNBC.com notice how there are spikes in the price after hours on Thursday Aug 7 and Friday Aug 8. This calls my attention, and I interpret like someone is buying these shares.

(Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INPX&tab=earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INPX&tab=earnings) snip taken at 5:57pm on 8/8/20)

Inpixon - $INPX is a technology company that offers location tracking and big data analytics to customers like malls, airports and government agencies for example. They are headquartered in Palo Alto California. Essentially this means that they help their customers with solutions for contact tracing that monitors crowd densities by tracking device. The CEO claims they could even color code and map areas (like a cruiseship) in order to take any action to enforce pandemic induced regulations (like cleaning, limiting amount of people, etc…).

Before I begin with the good things I found, this company has had a couple of reverse splits with the latest on November 2019 in order to meet the minimum price requirements of the NASDAQ, in other words they almost got de-listed a couple of months ago. But they keep on plowing ahead with acquisitions and spending… why???

In 2019 the company had a bunch of acquisition in order to become one of the best vertically integrated indoor solutions company in the market. The point of this is to become robust enough to attend the commercial but also the government sector. In the third quarter of 2019 revenue was up 63%.

On May 11 they announced Q1 2020 earnings. They reported a YoY Revenue growth of 32% in spite of the Pandemic. On March 11 they realized a partnership with Omniexperience to service a deal with Walt Disney. On April 15 announced a deal to service dozens of malls across Europe and Asia. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-reports-first-quarter-2020-200500382.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-reports-first-quarter-2020-200500382.html))

On June 8th the “Reclaim Your Workspace” campaign was launched and on June 25th they announced a partnership with Lenovo whereby Lenovo acquired the rights to sell Inpixon’s “Inpixon Workplace Readiness” which are products and services aimed toward bringing people back to work safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The product will be pushed through Lenovo’s network of around 20,000 field technicians.

In a business update call on July 8, CEO Ali Nadir said “To support these efforts (the sale of Workplace Readiness Products), we launched a nationwide Reclaim Your Workplace ad campaign, to expand our reach to key decision makers at Fortune 500 and other large enterprises and government agencies with a series of print and digital ads, online videos, radio spots and podcast sponsorships, resulting in an increase in our web traffic by more than 12x as compared to the periods prior to the campaign launch.” ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-ceo-provides-business-130000326.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-ceo-provides-business-130000326.html))

In the same update, he mentioned about a recent acquisition for an exclusive license of a statistical engineering software that will impact the top line by an addition of annual $3.5MM and also will improve the operations of their business’ platforms.

On June 4, Inpixon - $INPX applied for a FCC ID. Basically this is an ID that the Federal Communication Committee has to issue to any electronic device that is connected. Now, on Friday Aug 8, they have been given an FCC ID. Check the Report Issue Date and Test Result. (this has not been PR’d) (source: [https://fccid.io/](https://fccid.io/))

They have posted 55 new job positions in the last week for everything from Implementation Manager, Software Developers, Senior Full Stack Developer, Java developer, People Relations Manager, and more. The locations are mainly California, Austin, Vancouver, and Toronto.

UBS Just bought around $4.7MM worth of shares, and GLA bought about $13.7MM

Their market cap is a mere $55MM and, as of June 30 2020 the company holds $39Million in cash and equivalents.

According to EarningsWhispers.com they report on Aug 19 After-Market bu also saw Aug 14 AMC. (Please if anybody can reafirm this).

According to Finviz.com the Short Float is 27%

I have sort of read online about rumors on lots of possible new deals with resorts, hotels, cruise companies, restaurants and government agencies, but was unable to find any proof or official release. However it really calls my attention as to why all of a sudden they have all these hiring’s going on in those particular places (Palo Alto, Vancouver and Toronto) I suspect those could be possible government awards?! I dunno…. Please leave a comment if you know something, especially if you can leave a link with proof. 😊

All in all it seems there is a lot of activity and potential for very good news updates in the coming days. I would think that if they do not PR anything, at least they should on earnings which are a week away. I wouldn’t be surprised to hear about new customers or deals, and the FCC ID approval.

Thoughts of a Psycho Trader…

*This is not a promise the price will go to the moon!*

Markets surged higher to another record high close yesterday. It looked like a massive short squeeze to me. The bulls are strong so I wouldn't look to fight them at this point. The trend is your friend.

New unemployment numbers are out, job losses remain steady just short of 1 million this week. Futures are in the red this morning, I'm expecting that to get bought up after the open.

The **VIX** remains relatively high for how bullish the market is.

48,Contrarian Investment Ideas: Energy and Movie Theatres,"\# Energy

I recently listened to Jesse Felder's podcast interview with Leigh Goehring: [https://thefelderreport.com/2020/10/07/leigh-goehring-on-the-generational-opportunity-in-energy-stocks-today/](https://thefelderreport.com/2020/10/07/leigh-goehring-on-the-generational-opportunity-in-energy-stocks-today/)

Energy is really hated right now for many reasons, including:  
\- High supply  
\- Low demand due to decreased air travel  
\- EVs are on the rise  
\- Writeoffs of non-profitable plants

There are a lot of companies to look at, but when there are large sellofs, I prefer to look for opportunity in the dominant players that are less likely to default. Specifically, I'm looking at CVX and XOM:  
\- Link to stockrow: [https://stockrow.com/screener/e6c05a2e-bdea-4bbb-89a9-9e23a1e3e723](https://stockrow.com/screener/e6c05a2e-bdea-4bbb-89a9-9e23a1e3e723)  
\- Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/z0PCrDW](https://imgur.com/a/z0PCrDW)

My reasons for buying:  
\- High shareholder equity per share relative to stock price.  
\- Historically low EV/Operation\_CF ratio.  
\- Historically low P/B. This could eventually change depending on the writeoffs though...  
\- Higher than normal but reasonable debt/equity ratios.  
\- Dividends are unlikely to be cut, and relatively high dividend yields can be locked in at current prices.

I know the long-term (> 50 years) prospects of the energy sector aren't positive, but I don't see it going anywhere in the next 20 years or so. This is especially true after post-COVID issues settle. 

One signal I'm looking for that I'm not seeing is insider activity. I'd be a lot more confident in this buying decision if I saw more insider buys.

\# Movie Theaters  
Cineworld recently announced that it's closing down a lot of locations in the US, which hit all the cinema companies pretty hard. [https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21501986/regal-cineworld-picturehouse-closing-theaters-october-8](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21501986/regal-cineworld-picturehouse-closing-theaters-october-8#:~:text=The%20second%20largest%20cinema%20chain,Picturehouse%20cinemas%20in%20the%20UK)

There are a lot of small players in this scene (e.g. RDI), but the two biggest ones are AMC and Cinemark:  
\- Link to stockrow: [https://stockrow.com/screener/d63b6f0f-c6f3-41ad-88f8-72106269f958](https://stockrow.com/screener/d63b6f0f-c6f3-41ad-88f8-72106269f958)  
\- Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/8eWsMg6](https://imgur.com/a/8eWsMg6)

These companies can obviously go bankrupt, and the prospects look very grim until COVID is 100% resolved and everyone is comfortable herding around. However, the best time to invest is when there's blood on the streets?

My reasons for buying:  
\- There will be a long lineup of movies to be released by various studios all at once.  
\- AMC has more cash per share than the current's stock price  
\- CNK has a high equity per share value than the current stock price  
\- You can lock in a high dividend yield at current prices. I wouldn't be surprised if this gets cut though.  


The argument for theatres is much weaker than energy because it's in a much worse state. Fundamentally, if the companies don't shut down, I simply expect there two be a huge resurgence in movie-going which will prop up an extremely depressed stock price.",2020-10-11 23:52:50
49,"""Buy when there is blood on the streets"" | Cinemark Holdings (CNK)","Cinema stocks have taken a beating for the past few months, and likely for the next few weeks or even months until a vaccine comes out. This could potentially lead to bankruptcies or desperate restructurings/refinancings in AMC and Cineworld. HOWEVER, CNK has enough liquidity to survive until 2021, assuming 100% closures (which is already not the case because 80% of CNK theatres are open and the CEO positively stated that he does not intend on closing). A vaccine, according to WHO, will most likely be available mid-2021 for mass distribution, which assumes anytime next year between May and August presumably. Therefore, CNK will have 6 months of cash-runway, even AFTER the vaccine comes out and things begin to slowly reopen.

At that point, I believe CNK could provide at least a 2x return. 

The best time to buy is at the point of maximum pessimism, and I believe we are nearing that.

51,AMC in contract talks with AMZN for bezos-themed butter sauce,"think about it, retard. 

in 2017, amc stock was around $30. now the stock is less than $3. big rona is raging hard in people's hearts and ballots, and meanwhile america's biggest corporations are getting a raging hard-on for buying a chain of movie theaters.

bloomberg reported last night ""rumors"" that AMC is going to go bankrupt. True, they are running out of cash--which they had reserves for through the end of this year.

but where are suburban 14 year olds supposed to do with their time? where else they gonna try and hold a girl's hand, and get rejected? the movies, retard. they aren't going away, no matter how ""sick"" your home theater system is. you live in a studio apartment anyways, dumbass.

and honestly, movie theaters are simple enough to retrofit, you just install some new HVAC filters or whatever donald glover's air conditioning character tells you to do. unlike cruise ships or airplanes.

CEO Adam Aron then said on bloomberg following the rumors, last night: 

> ""the company isn't considering bankruptcy, and is instead looking at ways in which it might raise cash to ride out the pandemic. Bankruptcy, Aron says, might have to be an option down the road, ""but that time has not yet arrived, and any reports to the contrary are wholly inaccurate.""

AMC is definitely looking for a buyer. It's allowed now, thanks to a court ruling this last summer, i think.

Lookin at you Bezos, and maybe you, netflix guy. also, have you seen the AMZN Studios intro on prime? they show AMZN branded movie theaters, if that's the kinda dd you like. prime early access for showings? yes.

besides, rona gonna be background noise by next summer's blockbusters. they might even replay the blockbusters that got blueballed this year (tenet, 007, mulan).

position: **AMC Jan-15-21 $5 calls** (jan-22 leaps too are fun and cheap)

*tl;dr: HTZ replay*

**10/19/20 EDIT:** up ~20% so feel free to sell whenever--looks like I successfully called the bottom. i went in 10/16 with both more with shares and calls. if you yolo'd I would sell, but you won't listen anyways. im holding at least another month.",2020-10-14 10:48:19
52,AMC possible bankruptcy! Entertainment stocks or Airlines?,"AMC says they will most likely run out of money by 2021, what do you think? Are movie theaters a dying business? Streaming services have changed a lot in the past couple of years, looks like they are about to kill the theater business as well. What's Reddit's opinion on this? Do you think movie theaters are out? What about places like Dave & Busters, do you think these places are coming back post-pandemic. Personally, I think Dave and Busters is coming back and as far as Dave and Busters vs Airlines, I'd say Dave and Busters is gonna be a better bet only because people will be going out for the night in their city long before they are traveling and vacationing in other places consistently. Would like to hear your opinions on all this?

&#x200B;

Update: I put all the funds in my portfolio toward airlines while making this post got in on Spirit at $16.41 & Air Canada right around $11.50. ",2020-10-15 12:11:46
53,AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) vs. Cinemark (NYSE: CNK) - An upside comparison and the future for traditional Movie Theaters,"**Introduction:**  
 

AMC Entertainment and Cinemark are the two largest U.S. theater companies. 

* AMC is the largest theater chain in the U.S. and the world.
   *  AMC has acquired Carmike Cinemas along with the European Odeon and Nordic shortly thereafter. 
   * AMC operates 630+ theaters in the U.S. and 365 theaters in Europe.
   * There are even plans for AMC to open theaters in Saudi Arabia.

* Cinemark is the second largest in the U.S.
   * It operates 342 US theaters
   * Operates 205 theaters across Latin America. 
   * In an interesting twist Cinemark has a 25% stake in National Cinemedia (NASDAQ: NCMI) (The focus for NCMI is advertising)  


**52 Week Highs/Lows:**

* AMC High: $10.95 / Low 1.95$ - Currently trading at $3.04 (17 October)
* CNK High $37.83 / Low $5.71 - Currently trading at $7.86 (17 October)

&#x200B;

**Comparing the balance sheets (At a glance):**

&#x200B;

Before this comparison just some quick notes: Movie attendance has decreased gradually over the last 20 years. Both Cinemark and AMC have released rewards programs which has actually increased attendance in 2019 (And then a wild COVID appeared). Additionally both companies have increased their prices to bump up their revenues over the years.

&#x200B;

AMC has spend the last several years buying up Cinema chains (Lots of acquisitions in 2016-17), this has loaded them up on debt. So, naturally, COVID-19 has put the company in a very difficult spot. 

* Last year the company had $340 million in interest payments.
* It's debt totals over $5 billion. (As of last year)
* AMC is holding just $198.5 million in cash
* AMC has more theaters in high-rent locations compared to Cinemark - This lowers their revenue.
* Their current debt is 5x their current  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)

AMC is currently in fund-raising mode, they have stated they have enough funds through the year and possibly a bit longer. Recently though AMC has made a deal with Universal. A step into the streaming market, especially during these lockdowns, could move the company in a brighter direction if they can weather their current conditions.

&#x200B;

Cinemark, unlike AMC, has committed to more conservative growth, a move that puts Cinemark in an excellent position to weather the current COVID downturns.  

* CNK has over $571.76 million in cash
* Additonally they have access to over $100 million in additional credit
* Their expenses total to \~$520 million if we lump their interest and lease payments. (Plus some other obligations I'm sure)
* Their current debt is \~2x their current  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)

Cinemark has states they have enough money to last through 2021 comfortably. One important note, unlike AMC, Cinemark does not appear to have made move  towards streaming services. This could impact their future revenues if theater attendance continues to decline more in favor for streaming. 

&#x200B;

**The Takeaway:**

&#x200B;

This choice definitely comes down to personal risk tolerance, and depends on your view of the resiliency of the movie industry. Theaters have been on the decline for years, the reward programs have decreased this flow a bit, but how much will it continue to do so especially if people have unsubscribed from these to pinch pennies during COVID?  


AMC is definitely the riskier of the two, they have tons of debt and Europe has seen less theater attendance than Latin America has for CNK. However if AMC survives (by its own means or government money), there is potential for stronger upside, especially since they are getting their foot in the door with universal.   


Cinemark's conservative growth is definitely paying off during this time. However, if AMC does survive then what will Cinemark's moves be in the future to ensure their continues relevance as theaters continue to decline?

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts:**

&#x200B;

Do I think these (AMC & CNK) are super long term holds? I am hesitant to say. Looking at a 1-2 year window I do believe they both have strong potential for profit. Beyond that it is difficult to say. AMC's moves with universal could put the company on a new future path away from traditional theaters. It'll be interesting to see where that goes and what Cinemark will do to move itself from a potentially dying market. If you buy definitely set stop-losses just incase, and/or plan an exit price. 

&#x200B;

Thankyou to all that have read this far. This is not all inclusive so please please do your own research to supplement the quick comparison here. Additionally thankyou to everyone who provided constructive comments on the AT&T post. That was definitely more of a controversial stock, it was interesting to hear everyone's different takes.

57,"Here is a Market Recap for today Mon, Oct 19, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 19, 2020**

Stocks fell after the sell-off accelerated in the last hour of the market, as market participants closely monitored development for a near-term stimulus package and rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the US. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.63% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.49% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 1.34% down. Stocks finished deep in the red after the last hour sell-off.

Over the weekend, there were several developments regarding a coronavirus-relief package. In comments to reporters in Nevada, Pres. Trump said “I want to do a bigger number than she wants \[Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion proposal\]. That doesn’t mean all Republicans agree with me, but I think they will in the end. If she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus.” These comments imply that Pres. Trump is willing to propose a higher number than the $1.8 trillion the White House proposed recently. While Republicans have consistently balked at such a high price-tag, maybe Pres. Trump’s endorsement can help move the needle.

In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for reaching an agreement with the Trump administration to pass stimulus before the November election. She and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, another key negotiator, reportedly continued to have discussions over the weekend and are scheduled to meet again today. Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson said, “While there was some encouraging news on testing, there remains work to do to ensure there is a comprehensive testing plan that includes contact tracing and other measures to address the impact on the virus on different communities.”

According to data from John Hopkins, there were 57,000 and 48,000 new cases recorded on Saturday. While this is a marked improvement from 69,000 cases on Friday (the highest one day total since late-July) the numbers appear to be stagnating around the 50,000 new cases per day. The South and the Midwest have been the most hard-hit regions.

In Europe, there has been a surge in cases, with health and government officials warning of a second wave and imposing new restrictions throughout the continent. The Republic of Ireland will move into ""Level Five"" restrictions from midnight on Wednesday, the country's highest COVID alert level, for the next six weeks. Switzerland and Italy are imposing a nationwide mask mandate in all public spaces, even outdoors from Monday. In England a three-tier system remains in place, with varying restrictions imposed depending on whether an area is on ""medium,"" ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. London is an area of “high alert” meaning members of different households cannot meet in indoor spaces and restaurants, bars have a 10 p.m. curfew, and a ban on gatherings of more than six people. In France, nine cities, including Paris, have been placed under a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. 

**Highlights**

Over the weekend the general media has announced Joe Biden as the president elect. We have been preparing for this moment for weaks, so now it's time to watch these hot sectors. Cannabis is one of them. Just overnight, TLRY reached a new high almost returning it to pre-covid levels. We saw decriminalization and legalization pass in many states throughout the country, and I only expect this sector to main in the spotlight as we move into next year.

Everyone is jumping on this bandwagon, so make sure you take profits when you can. If you bought TLRY last time it was on my watchlist, you already saw this stock run 100%+.

Movie theater companies have all gapped up this morning on positive results news testing Pfizer Covid Vaccines.

\- Pfizer, BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine 90% Effective in Interim Analysis of Phase 3 Trial, Companies Say

\- Phase 3 Trial of Pfizer, BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine Could Furnish Safety Data During Third Week of November, Pfizer Says

\- Pfizer, BioNTech on Track to Seek Regulatory Authorization of Covid-19 Vaccine as Early as This Month, Pfizer Says

Movie theaters have been beaten down so low that people are capitalizing on the possibility of being able to go to the movies again. Some of these have gapped up immensely already, but could make for some good momentum plays or scalps throughout the day.

&#x200B;

[Some of these still have large gaps to fill, be prepared for a correction.](https://preview.redd.it/8qn5gkdem7y51.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=38eb3ebdfa88f0219689198d0fd3158e149783e0)

***$APVO:***

Pre-market gapper this morning, going from $22 to a high of $82.84 before selling off to the current price of $46. Will be watching this stock for volume/momentum plays today.

Aptevo Therapeutics Inc.  almost tripled to  $68.24  in premarket trading Monday after the company said it saw positive results in its ongoing APVO436 Phase 1 clinical trial.

The biotechnology company's APVO436 is an anti-CD123 x anti-CD3 targeted investigational bispecific antibody therapy being evaluated for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome in a Phase 1/1b dose- escalation study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic profile. Aptevo said it received preliminary data that indicated complete remission in a second patient, in addition to the one previously announced. In total, there are now two patients with clinical remission in cohort 6.

The company said the data received also showed one patient exhibiting stable disease status, and six patients where the disease had progressed. A total of nine patients were listed in cohort 6 of the clinical trial.  Aptevo Therapeutics  said the second patient with complete remission showed bone marrow blasts of 33% at screen, then exhibited a rise in blasts to 46% after the first cycle of treatment. Subsequently, the bone marrow blasts dropped to 8% after the second cycle, and to 4% after the fourth cycle of treatment. The patient's platelet count and absolute neutrophil count met complete remission criteria.

65,AMC Entertainment Stock 2021,"I know that AMC Theaters is extremely risky right now, and there's a lot of things that need to go right in order for them to avoid bankruptcy, but if they're able to weather the storm, wouldn't the theater industry be in a much better place come 2021? 

I guess my logic is that, all of the movies that were delayed in 2020 now are going to release in 2021, on top of all the movies originally slated to release in 2021. So the amount of tent pole movies have now doubled for them next year. 

To me, it seems like a unique advantage that only the theater industry has when it comes to these recovery stocks. Someone that has to reschedule a vacation in 2020 won't then book two vacations in 2021. But people who want to see Black Widow, will see it 2021 as well as another movie like Suicide Squad. 

Idk, I could be looking into things too much. And they pretty much need Wonder Woman 1984 to keep its Christmas release date, but just something I thought was interesting and unique to theaters. AMC stock ran up to about $7 when Tenet released, so it seems like the idea of a bunch of huge block busters coming out in 2021 would drive the stock up.",2020-11-12 16:39:56

68,Are there any rules behind stock offerings? It seems like a company could really take advantage of public investors by constantly diluting their ownership,"A few companies I'm invested in (RDFN and NCLH) have recently done stock offerings and the share price understandably drops immediately after.  It means that if I used to own 100 shares out of 1 million for example, I now only own 100 shares out of 1.1 million.  In other words, my stake in the company has been reduced wtihout my approval.

Lot's of other companies have been raising money through offerings lately.  TSLA, DKNG, AMC, CCL, PLUG, just to name a few.  

So my question is are there any restrictions on how much and how often a company can do this?  Otherwise it seems like a company could really take advantage of the public by constantly diluting their ownership.",2020-11-22 16:46:37
69,Cinemark ($CNK) is Good and So Can You!,"What’s up fellow autists. I’ve been a lurker of this subreddit for a few years now and always enjoyed the content, the shitposts, the memes, and the rare DD’s. But this week, I’ve feeling for my fellow retards, especially those that gambled their 401k’s and Holographic Charizard Pokemon cards on $PLTR. Orders on $ROPE seem to be up BIGLY 🚀 over the past week, so I wanted to offer a bit of DD on an industry that you and your Netflix and Chill partner have become well acquainted with this year being stuck at home. At the very least, you owe it to your hand to hear me out about Cinemark ($CNK).

TLDR: $CNK 15 Jan 22, 20 Strike Bought Calls / $CNK 19 Mar 21, 12.5 Strike Sold Puts

So quickly, just to get this out of the way: I am a curator of shit. I originally started this reddit account several years ago because I got tired of playing shitty Super Mario Maker levels and had finally decided to make my own. Then, a year later, I was on a Pokemon kick and was desperately looking to trade Pokemon on my 3ds. It’s where I learned to sift through shitty trades and allowed my autism to truly flourish. You ever need a 5 IV hacked Japanese Ditto to get a perfectly spec’d egg? Do you have any idea what the hell I’m talking about? No, probably not. But I bring this up because when you’re willing look into the details so much for a fucking Pokemon, it only makes sense to use that same treatment for a financial investment. And just like Super Mario Maker, I got tired of seeing shitty trades and wanted to do something myself. So I went and studied markets and options the past four years and will likely try and make a career out of finance now.

But you’re here to learn about Cinemark. And here’s what you already know: Movie theaters have been absolutely crippled by Covid. That’s no secret. And just when vaccine news helps to get the likes of CNK and AMC back on their feet a bit, Warner Bros comes out yesterday and says they are moving all of their films to HBO Max. This announcement alone sent movie stocks tumbling as much as 20%.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html)

To add insult to injury, AMC had already announced ANOTHER 200 million shares in a public stock offering THAT MORNING to raise money, with their CEO going on to threaten investors that AMC will go bankrupt without help. This probably isn’t the first time you’ve heard of a possible AMC bankruptcy either, especially if you’re a subscriber to this very subreddit.

[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/)

And here is where I’m gonna start throwing some numbers at you. Because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that AMC is in SERIOUS financial trouble. Pulled from TD Ameritrade, here’s a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in Q3 2020):

Assets:

Cash/Cash Equivalents: $506 million

Total Current Assets: $609 Million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $6,808 million

Total Assets: $10,876 million

Liabilities:

Current Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $1,057 million

Total Current Liabilities: $1,588 million

Total Debt: $5,919 million

Total Liabilities: $13,246 million

So I know what you’re thinking: TLDR, StOp NuMbErs GiVe PoSiTiOnS ReTaRd. And I’ll get there, just like George R.R. Martin is getting to the end of the Game of Thrones series. But what is really important to see here is that for the CURRENT period that ends in one year, AMC has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). And normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. AMC is doing the former with a stock offering. But why not go to a creditor and get a loan? Well, maybe it’s because YTD for Q1, Q2, and Q3, AMC has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. Creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and AMC are in legitimate trouble.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html)

So this brings me to Cinemark and their balance sheet. And it’s here I’ll give you a few more numbers from their Q3 2020 Balance Sheet:

Assets:

Cash/Equivalents: $826 million

Total Current Assets: $984 million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $2,832 million

Total Assets: $5,803 million

Liabilities:

Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $599 million

Total Current Liabilities: $624 million

Total Debt: $2,519 million

Total Liabilities: $4,796 million

So I’d like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for CNK. Due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. What’s more, they can cover ALL of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. This is to say that if you believe that the Covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, Cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales.

The next thing I’d like to bring to your attention is the SIZE of both companies. If you look at the Prop./Plant/Equipment for AMC and CNK, you’ll see that

AMC has $6,808 million in assets

CNK has $2,832 million in assets

AMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. They are over twice the size of Cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of Cinemark’s as well. So AMC does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. However, with AMC’s financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes:

1. AMC goes bankrupt. They will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. Competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and AMC loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for CNK.
2. AMC looks to merge. This is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. And while Cinemark doesn’t have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the AMC currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. If AMC is twice the size of Cinemark, Cinemark’s market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of AMC (and that’s assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). Cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but CNK has also shown that they can manage their book better. They may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on.
3. AMC gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. Cinemark isn’t really affected by this outcome.

Next, let’s consider the technicals of Cinemark. Cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in March. It was trading as low as $5.71 at it’s lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of September to November 9th(vaccine news day), CNK was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. With positive vaccine news and a rollout of vaccinations, it is likely that CNK will be able to open its doors again in the next six months. As such, there is a case to be made for CNK not breaking a fairly strong level of support moving forward.

The last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. But since the election and Pfizer/Moderna’s vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. Specifically, money in the NASDAQ (Covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to Covid. Retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with Covid relief. You don’t have to look much farther than stocks like Kohl’s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like Tesla and AMD, of course). Many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where I personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. Sure, Covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the NASDAQ taking up arms again. But the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when Covid has been dealt with.

So to bring this all full circle, here is my TLDR for why Cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into:

1. It has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy.
2. With AMC on the ropes, CNK could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if AMC does file bankruptcy. They could even pick up existing AMC theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate AMC structure were to occur.
3. While still trading below its pre-Covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). And while Covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because CNK has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up.

Positions? TLDR? Give yourself a year on this one. Buy a leap and leave it for a while. If you hate getting cucked by Theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike OTM puts. That way, if you end up getting put shares, it’s of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). Premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in Theta and Vega.

CNK 15 Jan 2022 20 Bought Call: 4.00 (as of this writing)

CNK 19 March 2021 12.5 Sold Put: 2.40 (as of this writing). With a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. If Cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% ROI (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like I do).

70,AT&T (NYSE: T) - A stock Guide/Review,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. AT&T won over ABBV and PG in the latest poll (on r/dividends). There is a lot to unpack with this stock and it is definitely more controversial, especially in regards to it's debt. Let's take a look at everything it does, the financials, and a quick look at its investments/acquisitions. The dividend and possible growth with also be discussed.

# AT&T - American Telephone and Telegraph:

**Sector: Communication Services**

AT&T is a diversified global leader in telecommunications, media and entertainment, and technology. It operates four segments:

* AT&T Communications:

>AT&T Communications serves +100 million with TV, mobile and broadband services. In addition, it provides internet to more than 3 million business customers.

* AT&T International:

>AT&T International provides TV and wireless services to consumers and businesses in over 11 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

* AT&T ad and analytics:

>Ad and analytics provides marketers with targeted, data-driven advertising focused around premium video content.

* Warner Media’s HBO & Turner and Warner Bros divisions:

>Warner Media’s HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. are leaders in creating content and operating the world’s largest TV and film studio.

**Strengths:**

>\- Acquisitions have added to AT&T’s economic moat,  increased revenues, increased ability to bundle services (synergies that enable cost cutting).  
>  
>\- Billions of dollars in capital expenditures and company investments (over 170 billion the last 5 years).  
>  
>\- The company merger with Time Warner will allow it to squeeze its way into the lucrative streaming market. Having one of the world’s largest content creators combined with AT&T’s services could be powerful. (This will be discussed further below)

**Risks:**

>\- Lots of debt. This company is quite leveraged. The Time-Warner merger increases AT&T’s debt to the point the company balance sheet should be watched intensely.  
>  
>\- AT&T is largely concentrated in the US right now.  
>  
>\- Intense competition from Verizon and other telecom giants.

# Financial History:

Before diving into the financials AT&Ts goals need to be discussed. Recently they appointed a new president for the company, their stated goals include bringing down their overall debt, increasing their earnings and cash flow through the HBO and Warner acquisitions, remaining committed to the dividend, and the sale of underperforming assets to streamline capital investments.

This first chart will break down their Revenue, Earnings, Debt, and Debt Ratio over the decade. The source of the information is the company 10K SEC filings.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Short + Long Term Debt|Debt / EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$126,723|$32,443|$65,573|2|
|2013|$128,752|$47,005|$75,293|1.5|
|2015|$146,801|$45,551|$129,613|2.8|
|2017|$160,546|$45,572|$165,665|3.6|
|2019|$181,190|$56,172|$191,680|2.9|

Revenue as increased 5% YoY, it is pretty solid, for a company this large that has been around for as long as it has double digit growth is definitely not expected. Earnings has increased \~9% YoY over the decade, outpacing the revenue, this is nice since it is increasing their margins.

Debt has definitely grown at a significant pace, this is largely based off their acquisitions over the recent years. Back in 2015 they acquired Direct TV (gross), and in 2018 Time Warner + HBO. In both 2015 and 2017 you can see the spike in the debt to EBITDA levels above the 3x we would normally like to see, however AT&T has stated they are committed to reducing their debt levels, their stated objective is to bring debt/EDITDA below 2.5x. Already we can see at the end of 2019 that they have managed to bring the ratio down to 2.9, which is a good trend, something that, based on their quarterly earnings this year, they have been continuing.

Let's take a closer look at the cash flow, and their debt payments.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|Debt Payment / Influx|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$34,743|$20,272|$14,833|\+362 Million|
|2013|$34,796|$21,228|$22,706|\+9,138 Billion|
|2015|$35,880|$20,015|$39,792|\+23,927 Billion|
|2017|$38,010|$21,550|$52,342|\+35,882 Billion|
|2018|$43,602|$21,251|$11,023|\-11,328 Billion|
|2019|$48,660|$19,635|$15,430|\-13,603 Billion|

Net cash flow is very strong and growing \~4% average. Their CAPEX line has been steady, but note that it does not include the cost of any mergers, acquisitions or purchases.

Now, the Free Cash Flow to Equity is looking really weird in 2015 and 2017, the reason there is such a spike in FCF/E is because those are the years AT&T loaded up on new debt, note the spike in Long Term Debt in the previous chart, the influx of cash from those loans is simply being added to the FCF/E here.  If they are subtracted the ratio more in line with the $15 Billion they have averaged.

Lastly, the debt payments. After the acquisitions, we can see that in 2018 and 2019 they have been making substantial debt payments. Based on the recent quarterly earning they have continued to pay down the debt load.

So, thus far we have seen increasing revenues and earnings, strong free cash flow, and an increase in debt repayments. Good trends, yes the company is still leveraged, but not as leveraged as some other companies we have recently looked at (Looking at you IBM - they are currently approx 4x debt/EBITDA)

Anyways, let's now take a look at the acquisitions before discussing the dividend.

# Direct TV:

AT&T acquired DirectTV in 2015 for \~$67 Billion dollars. Since then (and even before the acquisition), It has YoY decreasing profits as more and more people move away from traditional expensive cable in favor of streaming. Already they are looking to action off Direct TV, with optimistic guesses it'll likely sell for around $20B Billion. There is no doubt that this was an absolute failure and questionable decision, even in 2015, given the trends. This is one of the largest factors causing the former CEO Stephenson to be replaced.

Selling Direct TV would allow AT&T to continue off-loading legacy, and capital intensive segments to boost free cash flow to focus on growth of more profitable (and not declining) company segments. It does come with a stinging loss of over $40 Billion just from the sale alone. The new CEO, Stankey, seems more than ready to just offload Direct TV, use the cash to invest back into the company, and move on.

# Time Warner (Warner Media) and HBO:

These acquisitions were incredibly expensive for AT&T, however, unlike Direct TV, they are becoming significantly more profitable. The profits for Warner Media in Dec 2019 was \~9.5Billion, these numbers are down for 2020, however much of the loss is attributed to the impacts COVID has had to the entertainment industry. Now, the introduction of HBO Max streaming was botched and delayed, this gave significant ground to Disney and Apple as they released their streaming services, however, HBO Max is reported to have \~38 Million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. Their stated goals are to have over 50 Million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 Billion by that time.

In addition to this, Warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on HBO Max. This move is definitely putting AT&T on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from Netflix and Disney will be. Warner does still have agreements with AMC, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. This just highlights how significant the move into streaming by Disney and AT&T have been. Yes AT&T was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and Warner Media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable.

There is a lot more to the Time Warner and HBO piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

The AT&T is a dividend Aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$29.54|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|19.44|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.08|
|Yield|7.04% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|Current Payout Ratio (Based on Earnings)|58.26%|

The payout ratio may seem lower here, however, using the Cash flow from the chart above, in 2019 their total cash flow from operations was $48 Billion, minus the CAPEX of \~$20 Billion leaves around $28 Billion in free cash. According to their 2019 10K the amount paid out in dividend distributions was \~$14.8 Billion. So just about half of the free cash, leaving the rest to be paid towards short/long term debt, or whatever other financing activities.

However, AT&T under their new leadership has several ways to go about increasing their margins here. Firstly, they could pay down debt to decrease future debt payments, this is one route they have mentioned they are committed to. Another is they could cut their dividend payment. The new CEO and management have stated they are committed to the dividend, however, this is a route that could be taken to further increase the cash flow for the company which could be used for more aggressive debt payments, and reinvestment back into the company to further stimulate growth and increase the profitability of their Media segment.

Note though, AT&T has not been buying back shares at this time, in fact the number of outstanding shares has increased from 5,926 to 7,305. This does dilute the value of the stock, however, over the short term (especially if you are holding more long term), this isn't necessarily bad. You will see less price appreciation, but because they are paying out a dividend it will allow you to accumulate more shares through DRIP, so later on when the company can afford to buy back shares in addition to payout a dividend distribution you will see the benefits from the compounding effect of accumulating shares, and stock price appreciation. This ofcourse assumes that the company will move itself in a position to afford this. So the question you'd have to ask yourself here is whether or not you believe AT&T can manage their debt, whether their telecommunication services will remain relevant, and whether their Media services can turn more a profit.

# Closing Thoughts:

This stock is definitely more controversial but hopefully this post helped highlight some key points. With the new CEO in management it will be interesting to see how AT&Ts current position changes. They have been trending towards completing their stated goals like bringing down debt, and investing into their media services.

If you're not sure if you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, please supplement this with your own research.

A quick disclosure, I do own AT&T stock, but that says nothing! Do your own research! There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion. Thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!",2020-12-05 20:46:06

83,A Beginners question,"Hi!  


Im  a newcommer to the stock market and just doing it for hobbies/funsies and of course money if everything comes together. Im using revolut app for this and just a few dollars every month from the money im not going to spend and would just put it into a piggy bank. When i started i saw that AMC stock have dropped a lot and since it was just at 4,5$ i bought 11.1. then it dropped to 4,32$ and bought 12.1 shares again it dropped to 3,98$ and bought 8.7 shares. Now its at 2,47$/shares. I know its a High risk stock right now but every stock new website lists it either a guaranteed lose or a possibly high gain investment. I mean i know if it survives the pandemic then opens the theaters/cinemas then it will rise pretty high but the company lives on debts and forecast websites list it dead within Q2 2021 or uder 1$. What do you think. Should I sell it now and aknowledge my loss then try it with another Stable rise stock or should i stay with it and wait for a miracle?  


Sorry if my question is stupid, i just had to ask from people who know their stuff :D",2020-12-29 04:22:30
84,AMC Stock,"I am curious to know what everyone thinks of AMC stock. It’s currently sitting at $2.32 per share, near its 52-week low. Can AMC make a comeback? Kinda like how gamespot did.

I hate to see AMC go bankrupt cause I go to that theater a lot.",2020-12-30 07:34:35
85,AMC will be back.,"AMC had a rough year just like everyone else. Except they may not come back. But you only think that if you have a small brain. AMC will be back because of the power of Hollywood. They will either call for a bailout for movie theaters or force producers to stop sending their movies to streaming. They need movie theaters to feed into their ego. Box offices numbers, Oscar's, and other stupid awards are still needed to validate their work. Every actor was calling you to vote for the new administration and they think they have help him win. Now they will want a favor in return, Bobby Axelrod style. Bailout the movie theaters and keep them alive.

I wanted to post this on WSB but they don't like penny stocks so here you go.

Edit: I did a bad job of explaining. Let's try this. AMC is at it near lows. I do see the movie industry going extinct but not in 2021. All year their stock has been at 7 then 2 then 7 then 2. When movies start getting released in theaters, I see the stock going back to 5s or even 7s. This would be a 100% to 250% return. Now 5 years down the line is a different story. I see this has a swing trade for a few months. Not a long term hold.

Edit 2: oh look it's at 4.50...",2020-12-31 20:08:50
86,1971 Javelin VIN Decode Question,"So I have been slowly gathering stock of what I need to tidy up my car and I was just looking at my title for it which made me think back to when I first bought the car and thought, Hey, the previous owner said he has changed a bunch of things about the car since hes owned it. He said that the 360 motor & 4 speed manual transmission are not original to the car since he got them out of a 1973 Javelin that he was also parting out.

The vin is A1C7978117078, which means it originally had the console mounted Shift Command automatic in it instead of the 4 on the floor. I have done a little bit of googling and every site that I have found so far with a vin breakdown only lists engines that are tied to letters, not numbers. So example, the 360 4V from 1970-76 allegedly has the code 'P' or the 360 2V from 1970-78 has the code 'N'. Now unless AMC just said ""Fuck it, 8 means it had a V8 in it"", it would be cool to know if it had the 304 or another 360 in it originally.

One of the sites I found that was accurate for everything but the engine.

87,Bubble protection,"Hi everyone, by now I'm sure most of you think we're in a bubble. The only question is when, not if, it pops. The purpose of this thread is not to try and time it, but to figure out the best possible hedge that covers as many scenarios as possible. I'll be writing a few scenarios on how these next 1-2 years might go and the best hedge is of course the hedge which will print the most in as many scenarios as possible.

Looking back at the '00 bubble, the pop started towards the end of March and stocks suffered a 20-30% correction in just 2 months. Then they started trading sideways for a few more months until September of the same year and from there on and the bubble completely burst and went down straight to hell, finally reaching a bottom some time in 2001 and 2002. Many stocks lost 70-90% of value and I'm talking big ones like CSCO. SPY itself lost almost 50%. Freaking SPY man, which is not composed of only tech stocks. Some stocks, like CSCO, reached a bottom in april of 2001 and then traded sideways, while others took a little longer. If you look at SPY, it only bottomed out in the summer/fall of 2002. This is what happened in the 2000s. Doesn't mean it will happen exactly the same way, but let's say this is our first potential scenario and that it plays out the same way.

&#x200B;

The following scenarios may play out over 01/2021 to 01/2023.

**First scenario**

Mimicking the dot com bubble, the market has a correction, then stagnation and then a long bear market that lasts a year or more.

**Second scenario**

The bubble continues to grow, with or without corrections. This is an important one, because this is just as likely, if not more, than the other scenarios. The best hedge should print in this scenario as well. This is why you can't just simply buy some tesla leap puts because, unless tesla pops some time in the next few months, those leap puts you bought won't be worth much. Try out the options profit calculator to see.

**Third scenario**

Flash crash, followed by stagnation. Imagine the market losing 50%+ or more in the course of 3 months before finding a bottom any time in the next 2 years. The closer to our date it happens, the more your puts will print. But if it happens towards the end of 2022, yours puts will probably be near worthless by then. So the hedge has to answer this scenario as well.

**Bonus scenario**

We're straight flat for 2 years. Only play here is theta gang.

&#x200B;

Now there are a bunch of ways to hedge in a bull market. So let's proceed by elimination. ^(Note that this all assumes that our calls and shares were bought or puts were written at or near the top of the bubble. If you still got shares that you brought months or years ago, you'll have a much easier time to get out.)

Shorting: As a retailer, you'd have to have a death wish to short stocks in this market. I think it's obvious why, so this one's out.

Cash: Keeping a large amount of cash in your portfolio, 30-50% is not a bad idea on the surface. However consider this. If you look at the CSCO chart in the 2000s, it fell from 80$ to 55$ from March to May. Even assuming you use your cash to 'buy the dip' at the very bottom in April, CSCO never reached the same evaluation it had in March. From here you have 2 possibilities. You've kept your shares that you brought at the top and you averaged down at the bottom. You now exit at no loss or profit on the rebound. Or, you wait and hope the bubble goes back up. It never does and your portfolio is gone. So realistically the only way you'll get out of this bubble is by losing anywhere between 0 and 100% of your portfolio depending on skill, luck and patience.

VXX calls: Not bad, but will fail the second scenario.

Short term puts: This hedge is the most profitable one if we're going to be in the third scenario. But the third scenario has such a low probability of occurring due to what happened in March last year. Plus you have to time it and in this thread we're assuming we can't do that. Another thing you can do is buy short term puts every few weeks on overvalued stocks until the bubble pops. Then again, you'll lose a ton of money in the second scenario or if the bubble pops very late from now.

Leap puts: This hedge would probably be the best one if bought in the right company.  Consider AMC from 2018 (or even 2016) to today. This stock went from 20$ to 2$ over the course of 2 years. When the covid crash came, AMC only accelerated going down. When the markets rebounded on stimuluses, this stock still kept going down. Just a few days ago it reached a new all time low. And this is no joke of a company. It's the largest movie theater chain in the world. This company's stock bled money for over 5 years. A leap put in a company like this one, that's projected to go down in all 3 scenarios, is the best hedge.

Leap puts will however not bring you a lot of money if the bubble pops late or we enter in a drawn out bear market in which case you might even lose you money. That is why, given our lack of insider knowledge and inability to time the market and the risk that shorting brings, our only realistic way to hedge in this market is to buy leap puts on a failing company. A company that will go downwards whether the bubble pops or not, or whether it pops fast or slow. A company that's not something like NKLA. Because even though I strongly believe NKLA to be a huge pile of bs, the current EV euphoria might just be enough to make your puts worthless. So companies with 'potential' shouldn't be good candidates.

&#x200B;

I guess in the end, what I'm asking you, reddit people of higher intellect, is the following:

1. How are you hedging in these conditions?
2. Do you have any ticker in mind that fits the situation that AMC went through and if so, how would you justify it?",2021-01-08 15:44:12

“With the S&P 500 just 0.6% below its recent all-time closing high, investors have largely looked through the recent political turmoil in Washington, D.C. The House of Representatives is preparing to vote as soon as Wednesday over whether to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time during his presidency for “incitement of insurrection” after last week’s riots at the U.S. Capitol. Any impeachment proceedings, however, could pull focus away from President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda in his first days in office – and importantly for markets, potentially impact the timeline for the passage of another stimulus package, some strategists noted.

Strategists and traders have overwhelmingly assumed that another large stimulus package will come about under the Biden administration and unified Democratic government. These prospects, along with the Federal Reserve’s still very easy accommodative monetary policy posturing, have helped buoy equities even given the ongoing pandemic and slow vaccine roll-out to date.

$TRVN - Direct sympathy mover ACRX jumped 60% today on over 37 million shares traded. TRVN and ACRX are known to move together as they were going for FDA approval on the same day and both are opioid companies. TRVN is also sitting between support and resistance getting squeezed with a breakout target date of either tomorrow or Thursday. Target $3.30

$TMBR - Currently within 10% of its 52 week low, trading 5 times its average daily volume, and in a CLEAR cup and handle formation. First measured move target price is $2.10 followed by $2.57. Sympathy Play: #NOAV

$WEI - started catching some momentum intraday. Social media is beginning to find this swing. Break of 1.54 resistance should result in a continuation for another leg up.

$SALM - complete bull mode since breaking 1.30 resistance. 1.69 HOD can easily see 2+

$ADMP - this biotech has been working towards recovering from CRL on their FDA approval in recent months. Finally reaching prior levels. And ready to reach 1+

$IZEA - this has been a HODL and has more growth in the bag. 3+ to return to june 2020 levels. And see where this thing can really go

$OPTT looking to gap up premarket breaking $3.50 is key for run over $4.25 and $5. This is an alt energy play that’s been lagging Sabby Management no longer has a position. This company rarely PR’s this play is based on pure technicals more reward than risk. Low float of 30m on clear uptrend, ran after hours with strong close looking for premarket continuation

$PLIN – Chart play, long swing. Turning super bullish on all the daily indicators. Today tested the for a second time the $1. But the company bough back stock for $1.50, so my PT is $1.50

$AMC - Daily SAR turned green yesterday. Looking like a double bottom with first conservative target at $3.35, breakout target at $5.70. Over 41 million shares traded today and stock was up 4%. Looking for this to finally turn around now that life may begin to normalize, and as the new administration may be preparing another large stimulus.

90,Question about SEC filings?,"I am trying to read some of the SEC filings for AMC. When browsing through the SEC filing Form 4, Table I is pretty straightforward. But Table II is a little confusing. In column 5, it states that a member has (D) ""Disposed"" of shares. However in column 7, it shows that the number of shares that they have are increasing. How can their share value be increasing if they are ""disposing"" of their stock?

94,AMC,"Let's talk AMC Full disclosure I own some AMC stocks. AMC is currently down to $2.60 from $30 before the pandemic. The bad news -AMC announced they will need $750M to remain in business thru January 2021. -Warner Brothers made a deal to release its movies in theaters and HBO Max on the same day -Tue pandemic is still on-going. -AMC plan to sale 180M shares which is nearly double the outstanding market shares. So the stock has to go down some more at least in the near future. The Good news -AMC secured $100M in loan and another $100 in converted share -Wonder Woman opening was terrible and couple with pirates downloading high quality version of the movie the day it releases made Warner Brothers realized they made a mistake and will open their movie in theaters first as before come 2023. I myself downloaded a 1080P version of the movie just for market research purposes. -As vaccine for COVID-19 become readily available, people will return to the movie again. IF AMC can survive the short-term they will prevail in long run. Because there's nothing wrong with their business model aside from the pandemic. I for one is looking forward to return to the movies with my son. -Mulan didn't do well either because no one wanted to pay $30 for a movie unless you have a big family with translate to saving streaming vise going onto the movie. For instance, my son and I could go to the movie and even if we paid $10 each, I'll still save $10 and gave him a better experience. -As the pandemic nears an end, people are looking forward getting out of their home and go do stuffs, going to the movie is one of them.

Returner to the watchlist, and I am still holding my swing position in full. With the inaguration of president elect Biden coming up very soon, I'm expecting some sort of unrest to be documented or talked about on the media.

Chart wise we are primed. Currently testing the resistance of the current volume shelf at $3.06, looking for a daily close on top of the shelf over $3.22.

***$SRNE:***

Lots of health + therapeautics companies have been heating up recently, Sorrento being one of them. On Friday we saw Sorento break through 6 month resistance, and continuing in the pre-market today. Volume by price has already begun to thin out at these levels, so the stock could move pretty quickly.

By measuring the base of the wedge, we can likely assume that the stock has the potential to reach $16 in the near future. A close over $10.20 on the daily chart today would be bullish.

SAN DIEGO ,  Jan. 18, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.  (Nasdaq: SRNE, ""Sorrento""), announced today that Dr.  Henry Ji , Chairman and CEO, will participate in the following upcoming conference:

***$AMC:***

Strictly a technical play for me, as I do not have an optimistic outlook for the future of the cinema industry.

Heavy short interest on this stock caused it to rip a bit last Friday, showing relative strength on a day where the overall market was selling off. We are steadily approaching a multi-month resistance zone around $3.30, a daily close above this would be bullish IMO. Huge accumulation volume last week.

99,Looks like AMC is going to survive pandemic,"tl;dr AMC got renewed financing today which is not yet priced in.

I see a lot of questions on this sub and other related ones about what's going on with AMC pump. Unfortunately it's a banned ticker on at least one high volume sub, so there isn't a lot of information out there. What's going on is they [got $100M from US Bank on the 15th](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210119/A3BZSQ2C8222NZZA22252ZZZKRKUZ2U2ZB32/). I haven't seen any posts from those that seek alpha, reddit, or even in Google news about this (edit: There's now a [fool post](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/19/why-amc-entertainment-stock-rocketed-25-at-the-ope/)). The [latest news](https://nypost.com/2021/01/07/amc-getting-closer-to-avoiding-bankruptcy-until-summer/) is from the 7th of this month, and it's about how they're close to selling enough debt to survive the summer, and that's _before_ they restructured last Friday.

By way of full disclosure I'll tell you all how I got into this position. My investing style is very relaxed, I generally assume prices revert to the mean. So when AMC missed earnings last year, I bought in assuming Wall Street overreacted, an assumption that turned out to be wrong. Since then I've doubled down and their hedge fund lenders urged them to go bankrupt. I also diversified into CNK which has done well. I followed last week as the price inexplicably went up, but stayed on the sidelines as there was still a good chance of bankruptcy. 

US Bank is _not_ one of the hedge funds that urged them to go bankrupt. That said, AMC might _still_ go bankrupt, especially if vaccine woes continue. The bear case is that the shares are [dilluted](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/shares_outstanding) and that long term movie goers have adapted to watching titles from their home. For me, I loaded up on June 3c this Morning.

I have no opinion on whether it's primed for a short squeeze.

Commentator /u/youngbutgood in said in another thread yesterday [If the news about financing comes out tomorrow, the price is going to soar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l09fxj/why_was_the_amc_stock_up_big_in_the_frankfurt/gjsd6f3/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Covid Stocks

$SRNE - Shares of Sorrento are trading higher today after the company said it would present preliminary data from an ongoing SARS-CoV2 mutation surveillance program for its neutralizing antibodies currently in clinical and pre-clinical development for treatment of patients with Covid-19 disease. 4 hour ultimate moving average just crossed the golden cross moving average and printed a ""long"" today. This company is going to be relevant for its STI-2020 antibody which is currently in clinical trials, especially if it behaves the same way toward the new virus variant expected to be the dominant virus by March. Price Target $12.80

$HUGE - Company is testing FSD201 COVID-19 Trial which will test length of time of fever, oxygen saturation, clinical progression, time to mechanical ventilation or hospitalization, and length of hospital stay. The exploratory endpoint is cytokine clearance as measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. The treatment period is 14 days and the primary endpoint is determined at 28 days. That means we are expecting this company to drop news about their trial any day now. The chart looks primed for a ""HUGE"" run and there is excellent volume entering the stock. With good results this can run hard to $9. With mediocre results it can go to $3.80.

$HTBX - Currently focused on treating multiple oncology product candidates and a novel COVID-19 vaccine. Yesterday they announced they transferred its gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine cell line to Waisman Biomanufacturing to initiate a manufacturing process for ZVX-60 (the vaccine cell line). It is being developed for either a standalone vaccine or a combination vaccine to enhance prophylactic protection against COVID-19. This manufacturing news is big! It means they already know there is demand for their product. A daily buy arrow was printed on supertrend and the 2 hour ultimate moving average is about to cross the golden cross average line. Just broke through major resistance. This is going to run soon. Price Target $11

102,Stocks to buy now... AMC and ZNGA Stock analysis,,2021-01-20 23:25:22
103,EPR Properties,"Hello!

The Experimental Reit EPR Properties got punished hard during corona. However, from what i can see, they are doing better than the current stock price makes it look like. It had a run the last couple of weeks, so I assume it till come down a bit the coming week.

I just want to point your eyes towards EPR, since I think it is a very good opportunity - for the long term. I myself have been buying shares every now and then, during corona. I am now up to a total of 200, and this is where i feel my risk-tolerance limits me. However, I will very likely keep these 200 EPR until the day I die. I just see it as a too good of an entry.

&#x200B;

*Risk, you say?*

\-Yes, there is still risk to buying EPR. They are not out of the woods yet. But things do look a lot better now.

*A good moment to invest?*

Well, that is up to you. I just feel like the stock has not gotten as much love as i, personally feel that it should have.

&#x200B;

**Ofc, do your own DD.** I have done a very extensive DD, but I will point out what I feel are the big points.

&#x200B;

\-The dividend is currently halted (since  2020-04-29, used to be **$0,3825 a month**)

\-Very well managed company.

\-At the current burn-rate they will nog go bankrupt any time soon.

\-Theatres are a big income stream for EPR, whome are not doing so well atm. AMC is the biggest single tenant. And they are on the verge of surviving. AMC seems to be very close to have gathered the needed funds, not sure if this is confirmed yet.

If people are interested i can keep going. But this is what i feel is the most important.

&#x200B;

I do not want anyone to buy the stock because of my post. I just feel like ppl has forgotten about this stock, maybe the people who originally are interested in EPR just forgot that it exists.

Also, a tip for everyone - if a stock that you really like is very low/high and you would like to own it one day some brokers has the option to ""remind you later"". For example to send you an email when the stock hits a selected price. Very useful imo.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: forgot to mention that it is a monthly dividend",2021-01-21 07:01:09
104,Azu's Best Dividend Pennies,"Disclaimer: I own none of these. This is not financial advice. This meant to be a thought-provoking post and open for discussion. I just research different things when my BP is tied up. 

What's a dividend? 

 ""A sum of money paid regularly (typically quarterly) by a company to its shareholders out of its profits."" Gains are a little slower than active trading but are more steady. If you keep losing your ass trading, you may want to consider buying stocks with dividends. You usually get the dividend payout once per quarter. 

Three things to look for when looking for dividend stocks:

1. Find an actual dividend stock

Check multiple sources. Sometimes one site will say one thing and one will say another. If in doubt, contact the company's investor relations.

2.  Compare it to peers

Is it a fair percentage? Are other companies paying more or less? What are the financials of those companies? You may come across one that has an 80% dividend return! That's gotta be great right? Wrong. That's a huge red flag. That mean's most of that companies income is going into paying out dividends. This could easily send a company into debt just to pay out the dividend. 4% is generally good and 10% is the start of being risky

3. Amount of time paying dividends

Did they just start? Give that one 10 years before you trust it. Lots of companies start out extremely optimistic and great hopes for the future. But even poor people have hope, that should tell you something. 

&#x200B;

> ""GAMCO Investors, Inc. is a well-known diversified asset manager and financial services company. The company's investment services are primarily offered through its subsidiary GAMCO Asset Managment Inc, which manages separate accounts for high net worth individuals, institutions, and qualified pension plans, and through the Company's role as advisor to a family of Mutual Funds."" -From their website

&#x200B;

Price: 3.530

2. MITT -  [**AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc.**](http://www.agmit.com/)

Its Credit Investments include Residential Investments and Commercial Investments. AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc. is externally managed and advised by AG REIT Management, LLC, a subsidiary of Angelo, Gordon & Co., L.P., an SEC-registered investment adviser that specializes in alternative investment activities. -Their website

Its most previous dividend was rather low ($.03) but that's actually a healthy sign that they aren't bending over backwards collapsing the company paying a dividend on a shitty year for their market. Previous dividend per stock range from $.10 - $.80.

Price: $3.085

(current) dividend: Estimated $.12 (4%)

Time Paying Dividends: 10 years

&#x200B;

   3. NCMI -  [**National CineMedia, Inc.**](http://www.ncm.com/) 

 

>National CineMedia (NCM) is America’s Movie Network. As the largest cinema advertising network in the U.S., we unite brands with the power of movies and engage movie fans anytime and anywhere.

(NYSE:CNK) and Regal Entertainment Group (a subsidiary of Cineworld Group PLC, LON: CINE). NCM’s cinema advertising network offers broad reach and unparalleled audience engagement with over 21,100 screens in over 1,700 theaters in 190 Designated Market Areas® (all of the top 50).

(NASDAQ:NCMI) owns a 48.0% interest in, and is the managing member of, National CineMedia, LLC. - Their website.

This one is a little out there because you're thinking ""Cinema? no one can go to the movies!"" No one can go now, but they will be able to eventually. Plus, they have moved in online and mobile marketing programs to reach a broader audience. However, the fact that should pique the most interest in this company is looking at who owns it. There has been a 222% increase in insider buying in the past 6-months and this company is a whopping 81.8% institutionally owned. Those institution guys usually like making money.

Price: $3.685

(current) Dividend: Estimated .28 (8%)

Investors have been closely monitoring the first moves of the Biden administration.

107,AMC 📈 or 📉?,"after doing my own research and what I noticed is not to many people are on board with this AMC stock. Some say risk to high and China no good, but if AMC is 48% owned by Wanda group with ceo wang jianlin. He has a net worth of 14.4b :| made up of 3 things real estate, China movies, half American movies. Wouldn’t that mean he’s making lots of money off those box office tickets? He is in China with control of American studios. I don’t think he would want to lose that American money? There’s more to it?

108,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

109,I need some clarification on Options.,"I understand Calling and Putting, but my question is:

&#x200B;

1. If the stock is at 3.510 & you buy a call at strike 1.5, what stock price has been met to break even and then profit?
2. Why would anyone buy a strike on the money instead of in the money?
3. (let's say I can predict the future & the stock price is going to $6 1/29/21. Aren't you better off getting the lowest strike call? 

Screenshot of AMC for example [https://ibb.co/C8wX19Y](https://ibb.co/C8wX19Y)

Any additional videos/tips are greatly appreciated.",2021-01-24 11:01:01
110,AMC stock looks great in two ways ...,"First, it's on an uptrend that is putting serious pressure on Short Sellers. We could see it jump 200% in the next couple of weeks as Shorts try to cover their positions.

Second, all AMC has to do, is survive the next few months for the stock to be profitable down the road. I've never been so bored watching Netflix/ Amazon Prime/ Disney+/ Apple TV/ HBO Max/ YouTube on the small screen (with a current attention span of about 10 minutes before I start shuffling between these different options). I'm ready to get back to the real movies and I think most of America feels the same. 

Give us a semi-vaccinated existence and AMC Theaters (and all post-apocalypse theaters still in existence) will come roaring back to life.",2021-01-24 15:48:13
111,Hedging Long Term Calls with Short Term Puts??,"Hi Everyone,

\*\* THIS HAS nothing to do with AMC or GME just FYI!

I wanted to get some opinions on whether this makes sense.  I am going to try to paint a clear and detailed picture in hopes of getting some meaningful responses.

Let's say you are holding 100 call options Expiring April 17 which are deep in the money, up a few hundred percent and let's say earnings is let's say February 11.

So you are making $10,000 every time the stock goes up $1.00 

You want to hedge your longer term call options gains just for a small window going into earnings... nothing longer....

So you buy 100 cheap puts that expire let's say a week after earnings...

Buy owning the exact same amount of calls and puts... would your downside be capped at the time you took the position?  Because for every time the stock goes down $1.00 you are losing $10,000 off your calls but increasing your puts by $10,000?  Essentially this would be a zero sum trade to the downside... but your upside would be uncapped correct?  

I say upside would be uncapped because if the stock rallies hard... your puts expire worthless... but you protected against the downside.

The idea here is i can buy insurance for cheap because you are buying super short term puts to protect your calls which are up hundreds of percent.  I see this working because you are protecting only against a tight window and you are getting the puts cheap.

Thoughts?

My logic sound or flawed?

Thanks in advance...",2021-01-24 16:34:12
112,My Watchlist for the week - Jan 25th 2021,"Here is my watchlist for this weeks for stocks which I am going to be investing in.  


# Catalyst based stocks

1. **ATOS** is my strong focus for this week since it is supposed to provide data from Phase II sometime this week. I had written [a detailed post on this some time back](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/l10ja6/atos_worth_watching_due_to_their_nasal_spray_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2. **WTRH** \-With an increasing focus on lockdowns and  new covid strains, WTRH is a good one to watch this week
3. **ITRM** \- This is supposed to gain compliance on Monday and I know they are expecting news soon for 3 pivotal phase 3 drugs for which SPA received as shown below (approval is supposed to be sometime this month). RA Capital also had a recent 18% Stake

&#x200B;

# Pure chart  and momentum  based  plays

These are basically based upon the chart plays from last week which had momentum after hours and most likely will continue momentum this week. Please note, **this is not guaranteed and hence check if momentum has continued before buying in**  


1. **CETX** : This had a small spike in after hours on friday and was dragged down but there were more buyers than sellers at close. The float is low and any momentum on this can send  it parabolic ( float : 16M as per yahoo). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4rcotxtntcd61.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=933ab7221bde2965e2cf6f4a137ee46265939d50

2.  **SYN** \- This stock has been super interesting in terms of there have  been spikes but they have been nicely constrained over the last few days in terms of price not going overboard. Sooner or later, this will go and the low float makes it even more attractive ( float : 18M)

This is the five day chart and you can see a gradual uptrend with some strong pullbacks as people have tried to get in at lower prices for some reason   


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d2s47q09ucd61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=866a2c7c1e276eb754491f71f473151f9c8739e2

  
3. **AMC** \- This one needs no introduction since its running on pure hype and WSB stuff but it is heavily shorted and they did have good news recently, just something I am watching for fun :) 

# Other stocks I'll be watching (not penny stocks) 

1. **$CLOV** which has a lot of catalysts this week and hopefully wake up
2. **$KODK** \- this to be honest is a bit of a hail mary based upon the fact that heavily shorted stocks are running like crazy (25% short volume on this) . There were also some large buys on Friday afternoon before close which could either be an indicator of something big coming soon or just an attempt to cash in on the WSB craze of GME. The chart also looks interesting

Obviously, i'll also also look to take a position [in the stocks that will come in my scanner](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/l36uwg/a_scanner_which_has_got_me_a_pretty_good_success/) but these are the main  swing ones.

$PLL DJ Piedmont Lithium Price Target Announced at $64.00/Share by Loop Capital

$TRCH this company has merger news coming up with Meta. When this company mergers TRCH shareholders will receive 20% of the combined company. This stock is on a high watch for me personally and any dips this stocks presents it’s a buy imo. Anything under $2 is a steal. When this company mergers it will be trading under $META. The market sentiment towards merger news is extremely bullish. This company is already have partnerships with major corporations like Samsung and Sony.

$OPTT this stock has been on a strong uptrend right along with $OEG. This stock may retest $4.50 with the 1st target at $7+, many traders are expecting this to run to $10. Any dips this stock provides are buying opportunities as it has been moving in this extremely hot solar energy sector. The same applies for $OEG

$BLNK inverted hammer on the daily. price seems to consistently bounce off of the uptrending support of the rising channel. lower bollinger band has found support at the EMA40 which appears to be the pivot bottom. current price level is back testing neckline for support on what appears to be an inverse head an shoulder. $45 to 54 would make for a 20% move. 52WH is 57.85. approx 30% from current price. the top of the rising channel, or uptrending resistance is currently around $68.50 which is a 50%+ move from current price level. stockinvest continues to raise their price predictions and now is predicting with a 90% probability that within the next 3 months BLNK could rise to $320.24-408.83!!! insane.

$MDGS strong close on Friday staying above the ema 20 stock is still entirely undervalued. The company have many catalyst with it being an EV as its leading catalyst. When the stock heads over $3.20 it will begin to break out. The stock is said to be mirroring price action movements of $SGBX and $AYRO with the ability to double with its first target within the $4 range with potential for $5+. This stock is heavily pumped on social media. Recently had an offering and closed it. This company loves to PR

Covid Related Plays

$SGBX symmetrical triangle with break point coming soon. may prove to be a good swing idea. i believe this is a covid vaccine distribution play.

$AMPE broke out of a bullish pennant for a leg up. def worth watching. they’re making a covid related medication

$ITP $NBY Biden signs order requiring masks on planes, buses, trains and at airports. These are mask plays and will catch some hits as more news becomes available. Masks are also mandated on federal property as well. These executed orders come as close to a national mask mandate as his federal powers may allow, leaving it to states and municipalities to require residents to wear masks at a local level.

TECHNICALS:

$SFET - Teacup with handle being formed right now. Curling off the bottom of the daily chart, room to go to $4 from here

$JE 3 white soldiers on the 4 hr. This may be the next one to go double digits.

$JMIA knowing your stocks price history is important. Seeing this stock making ATHs indicates a key breakout and most likely will continue until it finds its new pivot too aka new resistance.

$KIRK 3 white soldiers on the daily.

Continuation Plays/Swing Ideas

$NEXT cup and handle breakout off the EMA200 on the daily.

$MKD spiked to test EMA200 pivot top on the daily. the start of a bullish move back up. this stock has seen ATHs of $11. good to keep eyes on to see what it does next. may present a scalp opportunity premarket or at the bell.

$ITRM under atlas radar now. Charter 1 has been quite familiar with this stock. timestamps never lie. this stock should present great swing opportunity. keeps close watch.

$PACK on mad mike friday afternoon. and was getting alot of attention. this is a box making company. has anyone ever seen the tv series lost? where the big guy was rich from his financial advisor investing his money in a box making company that took off. and the most likely to survive the island was the guy who worked for the box company. hmmmm

$IZEA this stock is on a huge run. and imho i think this stock could end up triple digits one day in the future. for now it appears to have established support above $4 range. AH on friday broke out to new 52WHs. 3 white soldier on 4 hr.

$TRVN - 3 white soldiers on the 4hr. bullish engulfing bullish 2 candlestick reversal pattern on the daily.

$EQOS - one white soldier pattern with a 2 candlestick ema bounce pattern. notice the green candles lower wick cuts the previous candles lower wick and both cut thru the ema20. mondays candle we want to see a confirmation candle. keep in mind the confirmation candle sometimes is a large green candle where pull back may occur after wards to shake out weak hands. before continuation may happen. or itll just keep on going leaving behind everyone who just watches whats going on.

$SOS - one white soldier on the daily. bounce off downtrending resistance after breakout out and backtest for support. bounce off EMA50 to breakout of EMA200 pivot on the daily at 2.30. this can easily run to 3.50+ china based company that deals with PST and ADT thru their subsidiaries. they look to have double digit potential in this market and their sector being a hot topic. automated desicioning technology.

$AMGN The FDA is scheduled to rule on Amgen, Inc.'sBLA for Nplate, a protein that raises and sustains platelet counts, as a treatment option for hematopoietic subsyndrome of acute radiation syndrome.

$NVIV - Compliance was reached at close Friday. News should come this week. This easily could be $4-$5 by end of week if news hits. Regardless even without news this likely gets to $3 by end of week. A market cap of $60mm with $25mm cash on hand and an advancing 2nd trial after a successful first one is still silly. $3 minimum, $5+ possible THIS week.

$HSTO - HST 001 Androgenic Alopecia - Phase 1/2 - Final data due 1Q 2021. Chart is bottomed and curling here, great swing entry.

114,CBD stocks are the new EV stocks in 2021🚀,,2021-01-25 03:58:50
115,Good news from AMC,"As I'm sure most of you have heard, AMC stocks soared today, based on news that AMC has acquired enough funds to stay afloat ""deep into 2021"" according to an article. They've acquired ""917 million in debt and equity financing."" During the short interval that the market has been open, I've seen AMC fluctuate from 4.60-something to 4.13. Last time it got this high, it ended up hemorrhaging. That was based on the news of a vaccine, if I recall. But perhaps this rise isn't quite as much a mirage, as it's actually on the strength not merely of expectations and hopes, but an actual, tangible financial development.

So, what do you all think? Is AMC stock going to soar or at least make a steady turn around? One thing I'll say is, they need to actually start putting out movies that bring people to the theaters. And hopefully hammer out exclusive deals that don't involve sharing with streaming platforms. Godzilla vs Kong is on the horizon and perhaps that can rake in some old-fashioned blockbuster numbers. But they need to start putting tushes in seats somehow.",2021-01-25 10:01:02

119,Nokia pump (by hedgefunds I think),"So today all of a sudden Nokia reaches every reddit front page, even multiple posts. What makes me even more suspicious is the amount of awards they got, we know how rare they are here, but every Nokia post here got them and even got mostly the same.

It is really scarry, I think hedges realised the amount of money floating around these subs and now want to take it from us or just benefit from it. Look at the Nokia Chart, went parabolic last friday with high volume. The accounts of the posters also look super suspicious.

Maybe this is testing the water for them and the worst is yet to come, but this is a good reminder to never trust someone blindly. I hope mods can do something about it.


Edit: Thanks for the awards (am I suspicous now? :D)

I did not want to say that Nokia has to be a bad investment, just that this pump was very suspicious. If you want to buy Nokia listen to some counter points in the comments and compare them to other 5G players like Ericsson.",2021-01-25 20:30:52

121,SPCE,"Okay so currently the three highest shorted stocks are: GME, SPCE, and AMC.

Now unlike GME, SPCE has a TON of legitimate potential. They're vying to become the future of fast long-distance transportation, and are one of the most future oriented companies. Now that said they're still an extremely risky play, but they're no where near as risky as GME is. 

Could SPCE be ripe for a short-squeeze? 

What do you guys think of this play?

122,Unusual options opportunity in AMC,"As you may know, a positive expected value on an options trade is generally a desirable position to get into. I was somehow able to get into a decent call debit spread and wanted to get some opinions on the trade:

Closing price today: $4.42

AMC $5/$6 call debit spread, Feb 5th, 2021 expiration for $0.12

Probability of max profit: 20.6%

Probability to break even: 37.6%

The bid-ask spread was relatively low, because trading volume on AMC today was huge today (most in its history, I believe.) If volume drops, it may be difficult for me to get out of this trade without taking a substantial hit on profits.

Other than that, what's the catch? Was this just an unusual options trade that comes along during periods of very high volatility? I'm curious to know, in case there are hallmark features that can be used to try to identify these opportunities in the future. Looking forward to your insights!",2021-01-25 22:43:06

This is unnerving and the company representative admitted to this YouTuber that he was already working with (and paying) dozens of popular investing channels. This is clearly a pump and dump scheme by this company in a effort to raise the penny stock’s price, only for it to crash down later. Everyone wins except the audience tuning into these videos to learn and get some investment tips.

I know AMC has a relatively high SI % float, but with the unfolding of a certain stock ,

1. Can large hedge funds/shorters /MMs somehow take a certain course of action to ensure a suppressed squeeze? Is there any possibility ?

2. Also, what are the potential downsides of going into AMC? 

I read the DDs on a certain subreddit about their consistent revenue growth etc. , but they plummeted abit before COVID started and went all the way down during COVID. I can only think of AMC declining if WANDA decides to bail out but given 20% ownership I don’t think so...

Look, we all know what's going on with GameStop. We know there are others out there. There are lots of stocks that have been heavily shorted for years and yes, a lot of them will squeeze, especially now with WSB getting so much attention. 

Along with those opportunities has come an influx of hundreds of thousands of subscribers to this sub, over 100k within just the last few days. With those new subscribers comes a slew of charlatans trying to sell shitty investment services/courses, promote their YouTube channels, get you to follow their Twitter, etc. **First, this is a warning that we will ban first and ask questions later for self-promotional posts, anything that is obviously designed to pump low volume stocks or manipulate the market, or in general is just a low effort, shitty post.**

**Second, and more importantly, I see this time period - with a lot of new growth incoming - as a great opportunity to vastly improve the content of this sub.** These shenanigans that have been going on with GameStop are proving to us that there are real opportunities out there, but we need quality content and quality contributions to find them. That means not filling the front page of this sub with bullshit posts that are two sentences long pumping your penny stock that trades 50,000 shares a day. It also means not posting ideas that are solely based around fucking manipulative hedge funds, short sellers, and the like. That's not because we agree with what they do or because we want to promote their ability to continue to screw over retail traders, but because doing this will bring unwanted attention to this community and potentially get us banned from Reddit.

So, sure you can post about stocks that have high short interest and that might present opportunities for short squeezes, but don't make your post ""lol let's manipulate stonk ABCD cuz it has 14743% short interest YOLO!!1!"" Instead, put some actual effort into your posts and let's find some real opportunities.

We'll be removing low effort posts and banning people who post repeatedly without putting any effort into it. At the same time, let us all look for real opportunities, post legitimate due diligence and share real reasons that these opportunities can materialize into money for everyone.

Let's use this 15 min of fame as an opportunity to work together to improve our community, make more money, and improve the quality of the content for everyone!

We are ***BACK***

***$AMC:***

We all are aware of what's going on with $GME Gamestop and one of the most epic short squeezes in history, and $AMC is next on WSB menu.

\-Short float was 36% yesterday

\-Beautiful chart to compliment thesis

\-Falling wedge multi-year breakout

\-Increasing volume last few days

AMC already has gapped up to $14 in the pre-market, but with the amount of eyes on this stock, I think it is worth putting this on your watchlist for today. I will only be partaking in this if the volume is there, like gamestop has had the last few days, and I only plan to scalp shares and options.

This kind of thing can be incredibly dangerous with a low r/r, trade your plan.

***$OXBR:***

Adding this one to the list of small caps with decently size short floats. With nearly 25% of the float short, and having a massive spike to $5.88 yesterday, if the WSB brigade continues to flood the market with volume on these stocks, we could go much higher.

Massive volume influx yesterday and not much price x volume holding the price down above these levels. Watching for continuation going into today. Scalps and day trades only for me on this one.

If you're not catching on to the theme yet, we are looking at squeezable stocks, and IVR is one of the few who hasn't seen massive gains yet.

IVR has a short float of roughly 24% as of yesterday, and has been bottomed out since the dip back in March of last year. It was trading at almost $16 prior to the pandemic, and has still not found a way to make it back up.

Daily candle close well above the prominent volume shelf at $3.56, on increased volume this stock could be sent into the gap zone and move quickly. Watch for that $4.71 b/o.

**Gap Ups:** AMC, BB, BBY, GSX, KOSS, MSFT, PBI, REV, UVXY, WBA

**Gap Downs:** ACTC, BA, BILI, EH, ENPH, GM, ICLN, LAC, OZON, PACB, PINS, PLL, POLA, PNSL, PTON, RCL, SBUX, SOL, TTCF

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Market is gapping down, likely in anticipation of many earnings reports being released soon. Hundreds of gappers on the list, as I always say, these are usually the hardest days to trade. The markets could use a nice pullback but every time the market  gaps down, it recovers. Not sure if that's the case this time or not, eventually we will get a decent pullback though so it's something we have to keep in mind that one day the sell off will not get bought up so easily. My plan is to be patient today and only take grade A setups if they present themselves, if not, no trades. Good luck out there.

**Notes:** 2nd Day of FOMC meeting today

138,Stocks to Watch 27/01/2021,"Good Morning,

Another really odd day yesterday with stocks fluctuating like crazy. The whole market is irrationally strong which can be good, but incredibly risky. If you're new to trading I'd really recommend trading in a simulator in conditions like these. Here is my watchlist for today. A lot of the names here are still experiencing momentum from yesterday - be wary for reversals. 

1. **$AMC (AMC Entertainment) -** Highest gapper today. This has been a heavily shorted stock for a while since the start of COVID but has just announced new funding which is driving AMC this morning. Yesterday provided some opportunities for AMC but I missed this, unfortunately. With NYSE listed stocks like this, we need to be wary of stock halts and so risk management plays an important role. Premarket high is at $17.90 at the moment so I'll be watching for a breakout over 18.
2. **$GME (Gamestop)** \- I'm trying to work out if GME will break out again today and, given the past week, anything could happen. I try to just focus on the intraday charts for stocks like these and looking purely for technical patterns I recognise. It's currently below the VWAP (VWAP at 255 at time of writing). If it can get over the VWAP, I'll be looking for a move up to 277.
3. **$EXPR (Express) -** This is our second highest gapper right now, most likely due to some sympathy momentum from social media. I really hate trading stocks with no significant catalyst, but if this follows a similar pattern to GME, I will try to ride the momentum.
4. **$KOSS (Koss Corp)** \- 43% short interest here so we are seeing a lot of short-sellers get squeezed out. Similar situation to yesterday. 

Momentum today will be quite scattered I believe so it's important to watch multiple stocks and set alerts at points of interest. There is a lot of stuff going on today and a lot of people will be watching different stocks. 

Other stocks I will be watching: UONE, OXBR, KODK.

As a reminder, trading is risky, make sure you put stops in place and follow your initial plan regardless.

Thanks all.

140,#save_amc Save our Theaters,"Removed from /r/wallstreetbets for reasons unknown:

I've been following AMC since I bought in after their last Earning Report on November 02, which in WSB terms is lifetime ago. We haven't been able to post about it since it was shorted to the tits and had an almost nothing market cap, but some smooth brains from /r/pennystocks pumped the price to the point that we can now talk about it what with its 1.7B market cap.

Since the foretold GME squeeze has come to pass, there are some out there looking for the ""next GME"". It's true AMC is one of the most shorted stocks on the market, and their story is remarkably similar and happened for a lot of the same reasons reasons. Like GME, AMC suffered vastly from the pandemic. Like GME, AMC was shorted by hedge funds, targeted by them in the press, and [told to go bankrupt](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/14/amc-entertainment-lenders-urge-it-to-declare-bankr/), which would have left shareholders with $0. Instead, CEO Adam Aron fought off creditors, raised capital, and [secured loans to ensure they'd make it through the summer](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-raises-917-million-fresh-113500190.html)

History
-------

AMC got completely and royally fucked during pandemic, as you might expect. Last August, they reported zero revenue, meaning they didn't sell _anything_ during that time. Their following earnings report wasn't much better, doing only 100M. For context, they did 1.3B the previous year, a loss of 92%. They were getting hit hard, just like CNK and RGC, but investors, expecting modest gains as states reopened, were pissed and punished the share price as a result. 

Then Warner Brothers announced [Wonder Woman](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/wonder-woman-1984-hbo-max-release-1234804411/) to come out on HBO at the same time as in theaters. This news was a surprise to theater chains, and after a metric shit ton of hand wringing, Warner finally relented and agreed to shorten the length of time they spent on HBO. It was around this time that CEO Aron sacked up and admitted they needed $750M to squeak through this pandemic.

They went on a tear, fighting creditors, [issuing shares](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/AMC-ENTERTAINMENT-HOLDING-15231781/news/AMC-Entertainment-Files-Securities-Shelf-Registration-to-Sell-up-to-200-Million-Shares-Shares-Fall-31928568/), and [leveraging it's European holdings](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amc-in-talks-to-leverage-european-assets-for-another-lifeline-11609950048). As of now, it [looks like](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-raises-917-million-fresh-113500190.html) they will survive pandemic.

Bull Case
---

""So what?"" I hear you saying. ""I get all my media via a Plex stream from my wife's boyfriends PC in the guest house"". That may be true for _you_, but there are plenty of people that don't want to be condemned to watching all movies hunched over staring at their phones. People want to go _out_ again. I want to go _out_ again, and I'd gladly get fucked over at $20 a ticket just to be safe and forget I was formerly in the midst of a God damn killer virus that's kept me indoors for the better part of a year. Really I can't explain this better than /u/Djperks123/, so I'll just [leave this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxir4n/movie_theater_industry_plays/). 

I hear a lot of arguments about how AMC was on it's way out, that people will continue streaming and stop going to theaters. That may be true, but you have to remember that there was significant sell pressure on the stock to bring them to the negotiating table. When it was $2 a share, it was priced with a 50% chance of it going to zero. Either you'd make some money, or you'd lose it all. Once the news broke that this wasn't the case, it jumped up.

I think we're going to recover more quickly from Pandemic than most assume. We're already [reopening in California](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/us/california-covid-restrictions.html). Vaccine rollouts, while slower than we'd like, are happening and will meaningfully reduce transmission. Also, as the weather gets warmer and people go outside, we'll see a reduction in transmission similar to what we saw last year. News about new strains is overblown, and so far every new strain tested is covered by current vaccines.

As I write this we're sitting pretty at about $17 a share. What will Aron do with his shares at this price point? It's hard to know for sure, but if he was willing to sell and dilute the shares when they were $2, I don't know why he wouldn't at this price. With the new money he could immediately buy back all the debt he sold, and bring back profitability even quicker. This would be a _good_ thing for long term investors, as it removes a significant weight on the balance sheet.

For those in it for the short term, AMC was the target of shorts. It is possible that these shorts will get squeezed the way Melvin has. Instead of Melvin, Citron, and Citadel, those pressuring AMC are Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), Canyon Capital Advisors, and Davidson Kempner Capital Management.  Unfortunately, I can't find a reliable short interest calculation on the web, so I'll have to rely on the word of all you degenrates on WSB that they're over shorted. If short interest increases with the valuation, the shorts will find themselves in a dangerous position. Every retail investor is looking for the next GME, and depending on the shorts and whether we have diamond hands, they just might find it.",2021-01-27 09:07:28

But these shortsellers are getting scared and shitting their shorts (pun intended) cuz of the recent mega squeezes that we've witnessed in GME, BB, AMC etc. But also cuz **Biden/Kamala administration is in talks of legalizing it on fed level**. So GME, BB (which i bought at $4.10 and wrote a DD on it back in November) and other stocks have **these key things in common with SNDL** when they were about to pop :

1. **GOLDEN Cross  2. Highly Shorted  3. Positive PR 4. Expanding Market 5. Under $10 stock 6. Actively traded by young traders**

After manually testing this on stocks that have recently triggered halts (AMC,GME,EXPR,etc) it seems like this could be a fun strategy to backtest. The only thing keeping me from doing so is the following:

180,What stock brokers are willing to sell short on stocks (e.g. GME)?,"I attempted to sell short some shares of GME (Game Stop). Trade details below, but the point is my order was immediately rejected because ""Shares of this security are currently not available to short sell"".

I would like to ask any redditors who were able to short GME today, what stock brokers or trading platforms were used, so that I can switch brokers to be in a position to short the next time an opportunity like this comes along.

I wondered if this error was a result of trading being stopped on GME (which apparently has happened the last few days). However, I tried to execute the trade multiple times, and the one time I forgot to select ""Sell Short"" I immediately \*bought\* shares at $318/share so seems like the stock was trading at the time of my test. I'm left to conclude my stock broker is trying to ""protect"" me from my own ignorance.

Trade details:

$9,573.83 Portfolio account value

$2,742.79 available for trading

$9,142.60 stock buying power

$  345.00 = Sell Short 1 share GME at market at time of trade

Update: This banner just appeared on the stock broker's web page:

>In  the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have  put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and  other securities. We made these decisions out of an abundance of  caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors.

185,My thoughts on some good future stocks - give me your opinions,"With all the madness surrounding GME, BB, AMC, NOK, EXPR, KOSS and other  potential short squeezes (disclosure: I'm in on AMC and BB), I thought  it might be nice to take a step back and look at stocks that would be  good to hold for longer than a week. I'm relatively new to investing,  but browsing forums, reading charts, and doing (somewhat amateur) DD, I  think I have a list of some good investments that can be held for a year  or longer. I'm not posting a full DD for each company, just some points  I find interesting, mostly the values and projections for each. For  disclosure's sake, I am NOT currently invested in any of these companies  except for MRNA and RVP.

FLGT:

If  hearing ""sales growth of 880%"" doesn't perk up your ears I don't know  what will, the last 12 months have been booming for Fulgent Genetics.  They have exceeded analysts projected earnings estimates by 501% and  277% the last two quarters. This fella is undervalued with those  numbers, even with the stock price up 60% in January alone. Currently  going for about $83 but valued around $140. If you buy now you would be  buying at the top, but it's still projected to go higher.

MRNA:

This  is one of the two stocks on this list that I am currently invested in  (approx 9% of my portfolio). While not \*quite\* as impressive as FLGT's  880% sales growth, Moderna's 826% sales growth over the last year is  still fantastic. One of the most undervalued stocks on this list with  the current price only about 53% of it's current value, Moderna has a  lot of potential. MRNA is up 55% already in 2021. Moderna reported only  $60 million in sales in 2019, but are projected to have between 1.5 to  15 billion in 2021. That's a huge window, but even if they hit the  lowest projection it will be fantastic for the company. Again, you would  be buying high if you went in now, but it looks like right now is the  lowest it will be for the foreseeable future.

NVAX:

This  company fascinates me the most on this list. The current price is less  than half of the current value. Phenomenal upside potential, with unreal  sales growth in the last 12 months at 999%. Novavax stock has rocketed  1302% in the last year. Reported 2019 sales of 18.7 million with 2021  sales projections ranging from 1.2 to 4.7 billion. While 999% sales  growth was impressive, the projected annual sales growth is an  astounding 2,815%. I almost wonder if this one is too good to be true,  which is why I haven't invested yet, but I am beyond tempted.

HZO:

Up  34% this month. Reported earnings the last two quarters exceeded  analyst projections by 120% and 177%. Undervalued with excellent sales  growth. The current quarter looks like it might be mediocre for  MarineMax, but the year-long forecasts look great. Undervalued by about  33%, the potential upside for MarineMax is solid.

DQ:

Daqo  New Energy's stock has been exploding, up 910% in the past year. It's  slightly undervalued, currently selling for around $100 but valued  closer to $118. They have had sales growth of 51% over the last year  with projected rates going much, much higher. One to keep an eye on.

MKSI:

MKS  Instruments is the first stock listed that offers a dividend. At $0.80  annually per share with a dividend growth of 10%, it's a nice cherry on  top to what looks like a good investment. Up 13% this year, MKSI has a  median projected growth of 17% for the next 12 months. Their earnings  exceeded projections all of the last four quarters each between 8% and  36%. MKSI has been in a dip the last week, down about 10%. If you're  thinking about buying, now would be a good time.

RVP:

The  second stock I am invested in on this list (approx 16% of my  portfolio), Retractable Technologies stock is up 50% in January. I see  an earnings growth rate around 40% after they had 133% sales growth over  the last 12 months. Like all these other picks, RVP is undervalued,  presently going for $16 with a current value closer to $26.

LRCX:

Up  12% this month, Lam Research doesn't have numbers quite as sexy as the  others on this list but it's worth looking at. Earnings exceeded  forecasts by 9% and 17% the last two quarters. Undervalued by about  $170, I see LRCX having plenty of room to grow, especially with their  earnings projected to grow by 45%.

WILD CARD: PLTR

Palantir  Tech isn't really a wild card, but it breaks from the rest of the list  by being massively OVERvalued at $38, when the current value is much  closer to $3. It's up 61% in January, but 12 months projections look  grim, with even the best outlooks predicting a 20% decrease in stock  price. The reason I put it on this list is because I do think it will  grow years from now, mostly from what happened earlier this week. Lots  of people, especially software developers, were amazed with Palantir's  Gotham presentation, many of them saying it could be a major player in  the future. I think the stock price will definitely decline, which is  why I'm not buying in now, but it will be worth revisiting when it  drops.

Like I said, very amateur  DD done for these guys, primarily looking at past and projected sales  and stock price vs value, with some consideration given to price  volatility, price decline resistance, dividends, and timing price  trends. Let me know what you think.",2021-01-27 13:26:54

190,Trading Inquiries,"Hi all, in the midst of all the excitement on r/wallstreetbets, and now being a seemingly good time to invest, I have decided to finally fund my investment account. I have some general questions though. 

1. How come different places show different stock prices, for example, my AMC stock comes in at 16.60 on ameritrade, but 18 and 17.70 on yahoo and google. Is this normal? If i sell what is the value I get per share?
2. Are there limits on how many trades i can do per day? I am investing with my own money, no margins. I have read that if you trade with margins you can only do 3 trades every 5 days. Does this apply to me? Does this apply to both buying and selling? Does this apply to after hours trading?

I'm sure ill have more questions in the future, but for now these are my main inquiries. Thanks!",2021-01-27 14:24:35
191,Not laughing,"I think what is happening on Wall Street Bets is just getting out of hand.

It's great normal people are making money, but imo more people are going to lose big time out of this.

I know I am losing. I wasn't willing to take a bet on AMC, Gamestop etc which in my opinion are failing companies.

It's a shame because people who enjoy investing in their favorite companies will suffer if the way forward is just to buy meme stock. Look at the penny stocks today and the stocks of more established and pretty decent companies. 

Sure it is great to laugh at Wall St losing money, but it's not so good when I look at the profits I had bleeding out. I didn't invest a lot, I couldn't afford to, but the little I did is slowly disappearing. 

I just hope it doesn’t continue as it’ll make investing at all one big joke.

195,Improvise and Adapt #2,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, but of course I am a retail investor which means today was a bit unpleasant for me. 

There isn't going to be a DD or a technical analysis below. This is just me putting my thoughts out here because I do believe they are very relevant, and I would like to know your thoughts as well.

So here we go:

&#x200B;

* **MMs are pissed at us** and they are out for revenge after the bloodbath they were subjected to by WSB. Whether you like it or not, at this point, you and I are a part of this war; so instead of being in denial, it is time to connect the dots and keep your eyes and ears open.

&#x200B;

* *CNBC says that NASDAQ tanked 3% because the fed thinks that the pace of economic recovery has ""moderated""*; **Honestly, wtf?** You are saying that this market, which slashed ATHs while the death toll and case numbers were increasing exponentially, decides to tank 3% because of what's happening with the economy? STOP feeding us false narratives. 

&#x200B;

* What's clearly happening is that **MMs are trying to recoup their GME, AMC, BB, PLTR, and SPCE losses by trying to short high volume stocks with very low clout surrounding them**. This very much includes SPACs because they are a retail investor's wet dream right now. They were the ones who made the market frothy so now they want to cash in these profits, short the same stocks, and cash in more profits while doing so. 

&#x200B;

* Few important things I did today: made a list of SPACs where any kind of announcement is imminent (CCIV, THCB, etc) and then the SPACs in which I got in at NAV and have been flat ever since (+-10%). You gotta diamond hand the ones where the anticipation of an announcement is strong but for the ones which have been flat, start slicing your positions temporarily. 
* why? because you do not know what their next trick is going to be and in this environment, cash is king. If you have the cash you will be able to buy the dips on the diamond hand SPACs while saving yourself from volatility. Using the same cash you can now also get into some other SPACs which are available at big discounts. 
* While doing so, try to invest in SPACs which have been out for a few months rather than the ones which were only recently listed. why? because the clocks are ticking on their management teams so there is a better chance of them finding a target than a relatively new one.

&#x200B;

* If this is an evil game, which I think it is, the SPACs associated with big names (especially Chamath) are going to suffer the most. 

Here are a few SPACs that are available at good discounts right now:

RTP, QELL, SNPR, PSTH, FTOC, PDAC, AJAX, EQD, IPOF, FUSE, AACQ

&#x200B;

Few of you asked me in the previous post how to keep track of new SPACs: here it is

198,"AMC is the new GME: cousins, not competitors, AMC is the next big short squeeze, and outperformed GME today by 165% with a price still under $20","AMC is the new GME, with better fundamentals and outlook. Before you autists get all frothy at me, I'm not telling anyone to give up their 💎🙌. The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.

AMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.

GME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.

If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing ""Safe & Clean"" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

Their debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

In the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

**My Notable Picks Today:**

**$NOK - +28.5%**

**$AMC- +275%**

In case you haven't noticed, I am making these picks before the huge gains.

It was a tough day for my portfolio. My portfolio is down 10%, or $70,000. This is why I said to play carefully with the 3x. While they can go up by 3x, they also go down by that much. Overall, I'm satisfied to keep holding them as I can stomach the temporary loss. I've been in crypto since 2011 so I'd like to think I'm use to these kind of losses (and more).

**Adding to Watchlist:**

**$NOK** \- This has been added to my watchlist since I saw it start trending on the internet as of recently. I picked this one just like I did AMC before they exploded. This one still has room to grow, and it will be in the news now. Tread carefully; this is the higher risk level play. I'd put a couple hundred, or thousand on some short term OTM calls. Or, sell covered calls on the way up.

* Target Price: $10
* Entry: <$6
* Risk: 5
* Timeframe: 1-2 weeks

**$CSTA.U** \- Constellation Acquisition Corp is a SPAC that is planning on acquiring a innovative company in one of the segments of the rapidly changing global economy. ""The company is led by **CEO and Chairman Klaus Kleinfeld**, who previously served as CEO of NEOM, Arconic, and Alcoa. He is joined by **CFO Thomas Stapp**, whose previous roles include serving as an Associate Partner at Bain & Company and a Principal at Oliver Wyman."" I see this SPAC doubling when some rumors start emerging of who they will be merging with. Hold some commons.

* Target Price: $20
* Entry: $10
* Risk: 4
* Timeframe: 1-2 months

211,"I have $120,000 sitting in my savings account and curious how to get my financial life back on track after divorce","I recently went through a divorce and I'm trying to get my life on track — starting with my financial life.

I currently have about $120,000 in my savings account.

**What is the smartest way to use this money for investing? Should I:**

* Dump a large lump sum (like $70,000) into something like VTSAX now?
* Invest smaller amounts each month over the next 6-12 months and then dump a lump sum if there is a big dip in the market?

**My Financial Stats:**

* Salary of $85,000/yr
* Side business income will be around $20,000-$25,000 in 2021 (most of which will fund my solo 401k)
* Mid/late 30s
* No debt
* No children
* I rent an apartment. I don't see myself buying a house any time soon as I live in NYC and prices/taxes are very high.
* $120,000 in checking/savings
* $30,000 emergency fund (separate from other funds)
* $190,000 in 401k
* $55,000 in taxable brokerage
* Business checking has around $25,000 but I don't want to touch that.

At this point, I don't really have any financial goals other than saving for retirement and building wealth. I live in NYC so I doubt I'll ever buy an apartment here (at least not within 5 years) but I might consider it if I boost my salary or if I ever move.",2021-01-27 21:50:00

*What does this info mean?*

It means these stocks are behaving with more volume and/or price swings than normal. These stocks are likely due for huge up or down swings. However, they may have already experienced them. I wouldn't invest in any of these without proper DD. You want to make sure you know what you're getting into. If a stock hasn't risen a lot but is seeing large anomaly, it may be due for a huge rise or drop. No guarantee here. To emphasize: this list won't guarantee you get rich or go broke - it just means the odds of extreme change are higher if you invest in these stocks. You have been warned.

Note: There may be slight discrepancies in data compared to true trade values simply due to when the actual data sample takes place.

214,I LOVE THE MOVIES: Part 1,"TLDR: buy AMC shares. My position: 7600 shares at $14.78 cost basis.

How many people have you heard talking desperately about getting out of the house? About how “I just wish I could go to the movies again!” People are FED UP with being cooped up inside. As soon as spring/summer rolls around AMC is going to sell out every single showing. 

But people will be scared to go out still!!? But they will be careful!!!?

Bullshit. I’ve seen soccer moms and dads cut off locks from Chicago city playgrounds during the height of the pandemic just to get some playtime in for their kids. People are tired AF of waiting around at home and are desperate to go to the movies, buy some overpriced popcorn, and get 5 hours of sugar sweats from pounding a pound of sour patch kids.

I REALLY LIKE THE AMC STOCK.

What happens when movies sell out over and over again? Price hikes! What happens when prices get hiked on a product that has zero marginal cost like a movie license? Huge profits! What happens when you buy a coke for $15 that cost $0.30 cents? Huge profits! What happens when your labor cost is minimum wage because everyone is unemployed (ok nevermind they always paid minimum wage)? Huge profits! What happens when a year of huge profits allows you to reinvest in a new and better movie experience and drive further growth? Huge profits! What happens when the stock is immensely oversold short? Huge profits! 

I REALLY LIKE THE AMC STOCK.

I don’t know about you, but I grew up as a kid salivating at GameStop and thrilled to go to AMC. Let’s bring back the good ole days.

215,Why GameStop & AMC Are Down After Hours,"Why GameStop & AMC Are Down After Hours

Hedge fund managers are scared. They’ve never seen anything like what happened over the last few days. A single subreddit and its users created one of the greatest stock rallies in history. GameStop shares have more than 5 X-ed and AMC shares have gone up almost 200% in one day. 

They are shorting these stocks like crazy because they want to scare off investors. They are thinking it’s a classic pump and dump and they want to get rich.

Here’s the thing. We the people have a voice. We can choose to buy in again at market open. If we all do so, then the stocks will have another stellar day. 

Keep buying. Day after day and week after week.

216,"A word of CAUTION about HOT Stocks (GME, AMC, BB< NOK et all)","Folks,

Although the temperature here isn't as high as WSB, I urge you to stay **VERY VERY VERY** cautious. We all are reading posts online that are highly concerning and outright dangerous.

# DO NOT INVEST WHAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE!

I cannot stress enough on this. It's okay to dabble couple of hundred/thousands as you see fit depending on your financial worth but do not be desperate and cut corners from the routine investments/stocks you have in other areas. This is detrimental in every way and will likely eventually lead to major losses. You **cannot** time the market and by the time you understand the situation, you will have lost a lot. Not to mention we Canadians are on the mercy of brokerage which charge FX 1.5-3.0% for every US transaction (buy/sell) and some platforms take 2-5 days to settle deposits which are a barrier in themselves.

# MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE MARKET WILL CORRECT ITSELF, EVENTUALLY!

It's only a matter of time, but things will go back to normal eventually. Please do not keep pumping with all your life savings. Many fellow Canadians have lost jobs in this pandemic and are on welfare of some sort. Please double triple think your priorities/emergency savings. Students especially, who need to pay for tuition deposits among other expenses are delaying payments in lieu of investments, I urge you to be **very very prudent.** If you're making large $$$ investments, please speak with your confidant/SO who would help you think through this.

**I AM NOT DISCOURAGING YOU, but please do your DD and do not jump into this bloodbath if you don't need to. It's completely OKAY to be a spectator and not lose any than sit in some corner over lost $$$'s.**

If you're a pro trader and understand what's going on, more power to you my friend, send us a selfie from the moon and we will be glad.

P.S: I'm in this game on a very small level that I feel comfortable with and can stomach the losses.

Some posts that concerned me and I decided to write this.

217,The Great Migration,"If after-hours movement is any indication of the future of the ""meme"" stocks, we are going to see a massive selloff in the very near future. As WSB becomes a cesspool of P&D clones looking for the next big hit, the smart ones in the bunch will naturally look for something else to invest in that is safer yet still speculative enough to bring them good returns, like SPACs! Personally, I welcome the responsible ones and wish them the best of luck on their journey through to SPACs.

&#x200B;

While we should definitely moderate the obvious P&D morons, I think there is a silver lining to all of this that you are all overlooking. Assuming that enough get out on time, the traders that are coming off of $BB, $GME, $AMC, $BBBY, and $NOK will be loaded to the brim of their hats with Citron's money. This can offer us an opportunity to welcome newfound or renewed interest in the sector, bringing in fresh investment, possibly some good DD's, and hopefully some respectable capital gains, which is what we are all here for.

&#x200B;

Use these red days as an opportunity to load up before people being turning their heads back to SPACs rather than complaining. There are plenty of great management teams out there that have dropped from $13-$14 all the way down to a tantalizing $11. And the near-NAV SPACs that were under $11 to begin with are now REAAAAALLY near NAV at $10.15 for some of them!",2021-01-28 00:55:55

219,AMC borrowing fees,"I got this from browsing WSB.  It is a pretty good post about AMC.  Of course it is risky but it has the chance for people to make a bit of money from it.  Again, this is high risk, high reward if something similar happens to it like what happened to GME.  The difference is AMC has less short interest.

Thanks to the WSB poster who provided this info:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing\_discussion/comments/l6mpwl/hold\_your\_investments/gl21n74?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/l6mpwl/hold_your_investments/gl21n74?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet:

Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme)

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.",2021-01-28 05:32:30

Honestly, as per all the shorters, I wouldn't like to be in their shoes when the Eversense 180 days device is going to be approved by the FDA at the end of Q1. The craze about $GME or $AMC short squeeze have brought away attention from this one, but I think that those who sold $SENS to start a position in GameStop or AMC will soon be back for a squeeze in this pennystock. This sell-off has happened all over the pennystocks that I follow, people chasing quick gains. And since those gains will be redistributed, I genuinely hope the next one set up for a run up is $SENS.

 [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=sens&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=sens&submit=Short+Quote) 

Polls over the internet suggest it could probably happen. For the sake of healthy discussions, please let me know your thoughts, why is it so heavily shorted? A potential life changing company?

230,Stocks to Watch 28/01/2021,"Good Morning,

Market conditions are hugely volatile at the moment. Some great opportunities, but carrying some of the highest risk simultaneously. GME, KOSS and AMC made some tremendous moves during the day, with GME/KOSS continuing to soar in pre-market. Here are some of my watchlisted stocks today:

1. **$JAN (JanOne) -** Highest gapper today with seemingly no catalyst. Looks as though we're in a similar irrational position GME. I don't like trading stocks with no news and so I will watch this one with caution. Right now, I'll be looking for it to cross $32.73 for a push up through $36. Right now though it seems to be trending down towards the VWAP.
2. **$ACY (Aerocentury) -** Other leading gapper today. Looks as though we may have had a short squeeze in the last hour, with it now testing and rebounding the VWAP multiple times.
3. **KOSS and GME -** These are currently both pulling back together and moving in unison. The trouble with stocks like these where they are so irrationally exuberant, people's emotions change from greed to fear at the switch of a candle, which is one of the many reasons we are seeing such quick, sharp movements here. I'll be watching these both on open. 

A lot of brokers are putting restrictions in place (for a good reason too). My broker has restricted margin on GME, and whether you agree with it or not, they're doing it to protect traders from potentially blowing up their accounts and are protecting them from people's inability to meet the obligations of a margin call. 

Other stocks I will be watching: AG, RHE, SNDL, AAL.

As a reminder, trading is risky, make sure you put stops in place and follow your initial plan regardless.

Thanks all.

235,"PSA: Please be extremely careful with your holdings, especially meme stocks. There’s a lot of stuff going on that can go south any moment.","I think that we can finally say that there is a pretty clear bubble, more or less in different  areas. The market has been acting absolutely wild as everyone can clearly see. People are pumping stocks for fun and that is worrying me a lot. If things go south, how big of a reaction will there be in the entire stock market?

Gamestop, Blackberry, AMC, Nokia have been pumped really heavily and seeing 100% gains in a single day for no reason should warn us to be alert at all times. Especially now, when many of us haven’t experienced this ever before in this big of a scale. 

While I’m really liking how the retail investors are kicking the hedge fund managers’ asses, we all should be prepared for the worst. Once people start to realize their gains and start to sell, we’re in for a wild show. And that moment will come sooner or later. That’s just a fact. People will want money at some point. When that point comes, you should have probably sold and gotten out already.

I don’t like to be bearish, but I’d say that there’s a some kind of a bubble now and it will affect all areas more or less.

Fundamentals are literally trash for people. Microsoft and Apple released some staggering all time high results yesterday and only few people seemed to give a damn about it, at least in this sub. I wonder when we’re gonna go to a different direction and pivot towards a more fundamental orientated market. It could take a long time, or it could happen next month.

Because in the end, the companies with solid fundamentals and consistant long term growth will be the ones that will perform in the long term... 

...But this is a different topic which needs to be discussed on a later date.



The saddest part of this is that the ones who suffer from this, will be us, retail investors. People will think that Gamestop, AMC & Co will only go up. That is unfortunately, not the case. 

And I’m fearing that some of us will realize that too late. Some people have bought stocks with debt and this will bite heavily in the ass, when these meme stocks go down hill. And trust me, they go down quicker than up.

People’s mental health will be on the line, when they see their brokerage accounts heavily in the cold. This is my biggest worry. How will people react to this when things go south and GME drops from their current levels.

So all I’m asking is for people to be wise with their money and put in an amount that they’re comfortable losing with. Stocks do go down. GME goes down. And everyone should be ready for it at all times.

I encourage EVERYONE to wait out this absolute shit storm.

HOWEVER, AFTERWARDS, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO LEAVE. Every single person with an account needs to withdraw their funds and close their account. MAKE THEM SUFFER. There are plenty of other platforms who don’t crash during volatility and don’t prevent us from trading like Robinhood has. Fidelity for example is free and I think you can even import assets from another brokerage directly without selling / re-buying. Ive heard TD-Ameritrade is decent as well. 

THIS IS A MATTER OF PRINCIPAL. This is incredibly important to me. Every day I see more freedoms and liberties stripped from us. Manipulation, censorship, and control. We as people cannot continue to let things slide. You have to make a stance and you have to push the issue.

Shares of GameStop, AMC and others jumped in extended trading on Thursday after Robinhood said it will resume limited trading.

“Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed,” Robinhood said in a statement.

GameStop shares rebounded in after hours trading following the Robinhood decision. The shares gained 28% to $247 in extended trading after closing down 44% to $193.60 during regular hours Thursday.

Robinhood, in addition to other retail brokerages, restricted trading on Thursday in GameStop and other stocks caught in a retail trading frenzy.

272,1/29 GME (and others) Gamma Squeeze,"One possibility is that the infinity squeeze was in full effect this morning and the brokers had to stop trades because they were going to run out of shares to deliver. This was the bullish scenario that we were banking on. 



Per spotgamma:



Not to defend 

@robinhood

but its likely the decision to remove $GME wasn't theirs. Here is a rough theory: Best guess $delta for MM's was $5bn = 15mm shares w/stock @ $350. GME float ~46mm much of which locked up by HODL'ers. Simply not enough stock.

50% of the gamma in the name was tied to 320 strike and 1/29 expiration. With 50-65k contracts in the money set to expire on 1/29, the potential share delivery may have mean ""failure to deliver"" as there aren't enough shares to settle. That creates a whole mess. 

To stop the squeeze and prevent larger systemic problem, the SEC tells brokers no more trading in $GME. $AMC and the stocks flop.

276,"Billionaire Hedge Fund Bailouts - January 28, 2021","What we saw today is something that I've never seen in my career before. It was a indirect way of giving the Hedge Funds a bailout by changing the rules of trading in order to force the price down. It all started when Robinhood decided to cease the trading of GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath & Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more. These are the popular ""meme"" stocks on the sub reddit (WSB). After Robinhood did this act that none of us saw coming, other Brokers followed suit. Even Webull was ""forced"" to do the same.

[https://preview.redd.it/lg3mw5oee6e61.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c0df75569f1e53a6bccc1f1415f6f06e8523303](https://preview.redd.it/lg3mw5oee6e61.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c0df75569f1e53a6bccc1f1415f6f06e8523303)

The CEO of Webull said, ""It wasn't our choice... this has to do with settlement mechanics in the market."" The irony of it all is that Robinhood, an broker name after a vigilantly that stole from the rich to give to the poor, did the exact opposite. In fact, Robinhood stole from the poor retail traders and gave to their billionaire hedge fund friends.

I personally will not be using Robinhood anytime soon. I advise everyone to boycott them for manipulating the markets. Maybe a class action is soon to follow?

277,The bullish case for Tanger Outlets (SKT),"After witnessing the GME explosion, I went looking last week for other stocks with high short %, and ideally low volume.  One in particular stood out to me -- SKT, Tanger Outlets.

[The average volume over the past 3 months is 3.55m](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/key-statistics?p=SKT), and has been slowly building -- the avg volume over the past 10 days is 10.82m, so some scouting and positioning has clearly already been done.  

The float for this stock is only 89.64m shares.  That's way less than other recent meme stocks like NOK (5.6 **billion**), BB (508 million), and comparable to AMC (102m).  

Given that AMC has a similar float, I then checked out the short % of the float -- for SKT it's **75.26%**.  AMC is 38.12%.

Furthering the case for SKT, [the open interest in puts has been dropping drastically](https://twitter.com/TeresaTrades/status/1354865732748599296/photo/1).  4th largest OI put decrease.

SKT recently reinstated their dividend, and being a dividend/real estate stock, this seems to be one that is safer to hold, and that current holders are less likely to try to exit on a pop.  I live right near one of their outlets, and you wouldn't think we were in a pandemic with all the traffic it has.  Even if malls begin to shutter their stores, outlet stores generally stay open as the stores relocate their inventory to the outlets for clearance, figuring bargain hunters will go scoop them up.

At the start of this year, a new CEO was installed - Stephen Yalof, who previously headed up Simon Property Group (SPG).  He was CEO of SPG starting July 2014, when SPG stock was at 168.19, and hit a high of 227 a few years later.  He ended up departing SPG in April 2020, obviously after the pandemic/crash.

Melvin Capital, as of 9/2020, [was short 1 million shares of SKT](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354162604311261189/photo/1).

This seems like an extremely attractive target for a short squeeze to me and I ended up buying shares and leaps last week, and intend on holding for a while.  The charts the past couple days have been following other meme stocks, but not as drastic -- up 10%, down 8%, etc.  Twice today the stock bounced off the 14.50-15.00 range, and it seems like the [AH orders showed that as well](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_279693951.png)

There's certainly some resistance at $20, but given the low volume and high % of float, OI put interest dropping sharply, I think it's a matter of time before this one hits the radar of more traders looking for the next thing.  Good risk/reward play.",2021-01-28 20:57:49

279,"Actual Reason You can't buy GME, AMC and etc.","Hello Everyone, so first of all, I just listened to the interview that was done by the Webull CEO, which provided a much better explanation on why the stocks are temporarily unable to trade. Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM)

The regular trading process:

1. A customer buys a stock/option from a brokerage (which is the platform/customer side of the market)
2. The brokerage sends the information to DTC (basically the custodian and the clearinghouse) DTCC usually requires a collateral of 1-3% of the transaction. This means that if you buy a stock worth $100, your brokerage buys the stock from DTCC for $3 (as a long), since it takes about 1-3 days for the cash to settle.
3. Once the transacation is completed you obtain your shares instantly, but the brokerage will have to send the remaining money 97-99% within 2 business days.

What happened to GME, AMC, and etc.

1. The trade volume skyrocketed and volatility skyrocketed.
2. DTCC became scared and raised the collateral requirement to 100%, basically 33x the capital to DTCC.
3. Assuming the trade volume as of 1/28/2021, 177.8 million shares, that means that the brokerage must now send hundreds of billions of dollars to DTCC every single large trades. DTCC does not have the capital to support it. Melvin Capital does not have the capital to support this.
4. What happens when Melvin Capital goes bankrupt and can't pay for the shorts? Answer: DTCC is obligated to pay for it. Basically making DTCC go bankrupt. What happens when DTCC goes bankrupt, that means the entire US stock market trading goes to a standstill. DTCC has a monopoly of 95% of total US stock trading (according to Webull CEO).
5. That doesn't even take into account the options.

What does this mean: the current market system does not allow such a large number of financial transactions to occur in such a short period and time. In addition, there is a conflict of interest, since DTCC does not want Melvin Capital to go completely bankrupt, since then DTCC might go bankrupt.

1st question you might have: Why does DTCC exist? Answer: when you buy a stock, you buy the street price and not the person quoted price. Otherwise, we could see volatility in the 50%+ forever with the transactions of stocks, since buying would raise the price and selling would lower the price even with a small transactions.

2nd question: What would happen if they don't raise collateral cost? In 2008, Lehman Brothers was like DTCC, they did not raise it fast enough. Basically, the hedge funds that used Lehman Brothers could not sell/buy, since Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. This causes a complete market breakdown.

3rd question: Why was Robinhood only allowing selling and not buying? Selling does not require collateral, so that would have been fine. Problem is that it only benefits the shirt-sellers, so they probably should have followed Webull and just halted trading completely.

4th question: What is the worst case scenario? GME keeps rising and it takes a hedge fund completely down, say Melvin Capital. Clearing House DTC will now liquidate the backstop, which is an insurance policy Melvin Capital must buy from another bank or investor firm. If the investment firm goes bankrupt, DTC is expected to pay. If DTC also goes bankrupt, most likely it's taxpayers to prevent trading halt.

**TDLR:** WSB + social media + other hedge funds (definitely some players got into this) almost caused the entire US stock market to halt ALL trading, so the clearinghouse basically changed the rules to prevent that from happening. Basically, they sided with the ""suits""/""wallstreet"", since they could have caused a financial meltdown..........LMAO",2021-01-28 22:18:58

281,Help me understand this $GME $AMC gamma squeeze. Haven’t the hedge funds all covered their shorts and switched to the bull side to recoup their losses? Isn’t making the stock go up giving them the money we took back va leaving them with a huge $GME bag,"Ok so I am going to be the huckleberry cousin who pretends to not understand why GME purchases were blocked for so many retail traders today.  

Who are you making rich by buying shares at elevated price? Institutional investors were not blocked from buying GME today at $120. 

Isn’t it simply giving money back to the people that we are trying to take money from? 

I am going to be straight up and say I am getting confused. Is the purpose to blow up the entire stock market and slaughter the accounts of every hard working American that is just trying to make it with a domino effect. Or was the purpose to hurt the hedge funds that have been manipulating the system bankrupting retail investors through shady tactics.  

$55 billion+ is truly hurting them.  Not buying back the shares that we sold to them at elevated prices will even leave them holding a hell of a GME bag. 

Help me understand because the secondary affects of a gamma squeeze because it will cause a major crash, correct? 

Is that the purpose of all of this? 

Hurt the rich and slaughter the poor? 

Is that the goal because this is now sounding like a suicide mission.",2021-01-28 22:57:44
282,IM URGING YOU TO READ IF YOU OWN AMC,"Guys, first off i’ve been part of this community for only a short time, a little bit before this whole short interest craze but I seriously love the amazing things we’ve done for peoples lives. I’ve read about college kids paying off their student loans, people being able to afford to pay for family members cancer treatment, pet owners being able to afford their pups surgery. It’s incredible and I couldn’t be more proud to know I have a stake in this historical moment in time with all of you. 


You see those headlines? That pushback from the big suits of wall street? WE did that. Together. If today was any indication at all, they are shitting their pants right now. I urge all of you to hold AMC and take advantage of dips if you’re inclined to do so. Please do not fall for hedge funds manipulating the market to send you into a panic sell frenzy. 


The squeeze may not be tomorrow, and maybe not Monday, but it’s coming. I was DEEP in the red today and in any other scenario, I’d be panicking but this is bigger than me. It’s bigger than you, yes you reading this. This is a chance for us to come together as a collective and revolutionize the economy for better.

283,$UMC Semiconductor: Bargain Compared to Peer Group,"I am not sure why this stock has not caught the attention of most traders (besides everyone being hooked on AMC, GME, etc.) but this is one of the best financially sound companies, in a growing sector, at a bargain price compared to their peer group.

Look at the following ratios alone (vs. Peer Group below):

P/E: 34.48 vs 55.56

P/CF: 14.48 vs. 181.67

P/S: 4.09 vs 12.58

P/B: 3.26 vs 13.56

Earnings Growth: 383.33 vs 7474

Quick Ratio: 2.33

TTM Net Sales: 6,073.53

*What does this info mean?*

It means these stocks are behaving with more volume and/or price swings than normal. These stocks are likely due for huge up or down swings. However, they may have already experienced them. I wouldn't invest in any of these without proper DD. You want to make sure you know what you're getting into. If a stock hasn't risen a lot but is seeing large anomaly, it may be due for a huge rise or drop. No guarantee here. To emphasize: this list won't guarantee you get rich or go broke - it just means the odds of extreme change are higher if you invest in these stocks. You have been warned.

Note: There may be slight discrepancies in data compared to true trade values simply due to when the actual data sample takes place.

Thank you everyone for the comments and questions on the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/) and [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6xc8l/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_2/) post on this topic.

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language). The last two posts might be impressive, but you should follow it in chronological order and pay attention to the evolution of sentiment in the comments to experience [true enlightenment](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/posts/).

Anyway, I apologize, but this post will be very long--there's just a lot to unpack.

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

**edit** *so while I was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot, /u/piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this: https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu

Ok, so I guess my in-the-moment mental math was off by about 10%. Man, that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade.*

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Friday, 1/22/21|197,157,196|$65.01|
|Monday, 1/25/21|177,874,00|$76.79|
|Tuesday, 1/26/21|178,587,974|$147.98|
|Wednesday, 1/27/21|93,396,666|$347.51|
|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

290,"Can't ""the rich"" just buy GME or AMC?","For disclaimer, I at the moment have no tangible ownership of any stocks and am just holding fake AMC stocks

I was wanting to ask, can't the rich simply stop shorting GME and invest in it? I understand Melvin capital lost billions but it's not like they are suddenly the only rich dude on Wall Street. Everyone is saying they are holding their GME to ""stick it"" to the hedge funds but now that Melvin capital is in extreme losses, can't wall street just invest in GME or AMC and get rich alongside Redditors?

Am I missing something in the mix?

Edit: just to expand and clarify, I'm not saying GME and AMC are suddenly guaranteed cash printers, I'm trying to understand how in wsb they are saying wall street is paying up for 2008 and AOC and others jumping in against the wall street ""elites"" when these wall street elites can just find a way to buy in and short on their way out and get money nonetheless.

There's a ton of posts filling up the front page all about GME and AMC and other stocks that are, or are potentially going to squeeze. Let's consolidate all discussion on these names into this thread and keep the individual posts outside to a minimum. 

I'll leave the existing posts up but I think we need to all work together to make sure this sub stays orderly as we have grown over 175k subscribers in just the last two days. There are a lot of bots and spam and we're doing our best to remove them but I think consolidating all these legitimate posts about this stuff into a a daily thread will help a lot.

293,Why BDRBF could be ready to explode (DD on Bombardier)," This is going to be a bit long but I don’t think you want your DD’s to be short. TLDR at the bottom.

Just a little background. BDRBF, or Bombardier, is one of 4 major airlines manufacturers in the world. Boeing and Airbus make the big planes, Bombardier and Embraer make the smaller planes (think private planes). Okay so a lot of people have been looking at COVID recovery stokes and as a result hotel stocks like MGM are already trading at 90% of their precovid levels (having recovered from a \~75% fall) and I won’t even get started on things like AMC. Most of the potential COVID recoviery plays are priced as if covid is almost gone, when the reality is things won’t return to ‘normal’ for at least 6 months. But then we have BDRBF, it’s still sitting at less than half of it’s pre covid numbers, and here are 9 reasons it’s massively underpriced and the stock price is likely going to the stratosphere alongside the planes they make.

1. First and probably most important, it’s undervalued compared to its competitors. Boeing and Airbus both have EPS (earnings per share) of -8, and Embraer an EPS of -22. Obviously these numbers aren’t good but what can you expect from a plane manufacturer during a global pandemic/ Meanwhile Bombardier’s EPS is only -1, much cheaper than its competitors. EPS obviously isn’t the perfect number for comparisons with different share prices and different number of shares but the 3 competitors have all had 4 quarters in a row of negative earnings, BDRBF is the only to have one positive earning quarter, and it is the most recent quarter (signaling their return to profitability). And if you look up the earnings misses/beats and earnings/revenue for the 4 companies BDRBF is the strongest. Part of this is because the private jet sector has been less impacted than the public aviation sector as discussed below.
2. BDRBF has around 8-9 billions dollars in debt. Yea i know this is bad, but let me tell you why it’s actually not. The large amount of debt they have compared to their 1.5 bill market cap might seem bad, and it’s a big reason the stock has stayed depressed for years, but after this week their debt will be cut in half as they sell off their train division for \~4.5 billion, cutting their debt in half. On top of this they have $12 billion dollars of back orders. That means with the new capita they have coming in from the sale they can significantly reduce debt and have cash to expand their production capabilities to meet their backorder demand (which they are doing).
3. BDRBF is Canada’s version of too big too fail. Although they are not at risk of bankruptcy, if they ever get in trouble Canada will likely bail them out (as they have done in the past). BDRBF is a very large company in Canada and has international footing.
4. Short volume is at 39%. While this isn’t too important, it’s a possible benefit with all of the short busting that’s been going on, and a potential for an immediate boost as hedge funds have been trimming their shorts across the market.
5. They’ve been cutting their less profitable divisions for years and after the sale of their train division, will be left with their high end jet travel division. These are the $70-100 million dollar private jets that have good margin and are (and have been) less susceptible to market turndowns. For example, covid decreased high end private jet orders only half as much as they decreased plane orders overal. The rich really aren’t affected by this stock as much as normal aviation travel has been.
6. BDRBF has entered into partnerships with companies like MHI which have transferred the risk of maintenance of aircraft to them, while still allowing BDRBF to supply the parts for those repairs. This derisks the company so you won’t have to worry about 1 plane crash tanking the stock like what sometimes happens with airline stocks.
7. Revenue from the business aircraft activities (the division they are focusing on as they’ve sold off their other divisions) actually grew 10% last year.
8. The volume of shares traded is at an all time high. This is something we see a lot with turn around stocks as people flood to but the stock before a sudden and sharp rise in price.
9. After a rush to buy pre owned jets in Q4 of 2020, pre-owned jet inventory has dropped to just 8% this month, the lowest number in more than 2 decades. An unavailability of pre-owned jets does (and has in the past) pushed/forced people to buy new jets, which will lead to more business for BDRBF.

TLDR: Don’t let the low share price or recent struggles fool you, Bombardier is set for an amazing bounce back as they raise billions in capital to increase production capabilities to fulfill their BILLIONS in back orders

297,Some stocks you should check out! 2 long term and 1 short term holding ( post and if you want youtube video),"  

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential. I’m holding about 200/300 shares in each company and I’m planning to buy more because in my opinion these have some very strong catalyst and plans for the future. If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! This company is literally the trend of the future and they have a very great management with very good plans.",2021-01-29 16:31:07
298,Need help picking a new trading platform,"I'm a small trader.

*What does this info mean?*

It means these stocks are behaving with more volume and/or price swings than normal. These stocks are likely due for huge up or down swings. However, they may have already experienced them. I wouldn't invest in any of these without proper DD. You want to make sure you know what you're getting into. If a stock hasn't risen a lot but is seeing large anomaly, it may be due for a huge rise or drop. No guarantee here. To emphasize: this list won't guarantee you get rich or go broke - it just means the odds of extreme change are higher if you invest in these stocks. You have been warned.

303,"Theory: Citadel is shorting all 50 stocks RH restricted, and therefore the market, and will try to hold on for one last stand","Citadel and co. restricted AMC and GME buying on RH in order to make a quick buck covering their losses by buying shorts immediately before the crash on Thursday. That much is true.

And now we have 50 stocks with restricted buying, and SPY is down significantly.

My theory? **They're shorting all 50 stocks, therefore the market, and will use that to try to hold on for perhaps as long as one more week before it's all over.**

306,Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds.,"As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

>It’s been a wild ride for the nation’s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

This is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds.",2021-01-30 00:06:52

309,My prediciton on what will happen,"TLDR: this will fade out and nothing will change at all.

\----

First of all, I am by no means a financial expert or claim to be one. I am successful at doing stuff with my money (avg return / year of well over 15%) and think I can handle myself.

I also am 45 years old and have seen a few things here and there.

I was also something you could call ""an early adopter"" when it comes to the internet, social media, etc etc.

My predictions (or rather, opinions) are more or less based upon the latter two.

&#x200B;

So here we go.

**The current situation**

From what I gathered, there´s different types of people involved. And I am solely talking about the retailers here. The side of the whole thing that THINK, they got all the leverage.

&#x200B;

1. **the Believers**

those make up the people that pake part because they believe they finally have some say , some kind of leverage, some kind of power to force real change. whether it is changes to market rules, legal oversight, changes of law... you name it. those people have real conviction and are willing to see it through.

&#x200B;

**2. the investors**

there might be overlap to group 1., yet these people have actual believe , not only in the message being sent, but the company as well. you can argue all you want, but the fact is that GME brought in new, extremely committed and experienced management and was / is in the phase of a corporate change. it might take them years and it might fail, but there is a chance they might pull it off. group 2 believes in this, hence the investment into it.

&#x200B;

**3. the traders**

they see this purely as a chance of having one of the best chance of high yield return of their lifetime (which is not wrong at all). they might also believe that they help the world become a better place to justify their behavior, which is also ok. yet they are mainly in for the gains. they are rather rational about the situation and simply wait for thee right moment. the only thing that sets them apart from 4, is their actual rational response to the situation

&#x200B;

**4. the hyper.**

those people jump on the bandwagon simply because it is happening. the same people will spread their money around, buying AMC, doge or even silver right now. they lack the understanding or they lack interest and patience to really try to understand the situation at all.

they want clout, ganis, or- the best - they want both. some are even stupid enough to sell all they have, luquidate whatever available and pour everything into one stock, if the hype is big enough.

&#x200B;

**Prediction**

**group 4:**

trends change, sentiments and rationales change. they were never so easy to manipulate as well.

most people will get bored , or simply jump on the next bandwagon. this means, 4 will skip the train as soon as the holding battle simply takes too long for their attention span. if you do not have the cashflow to actively be involved in regards to buying more when the price warrants it, you got nothing to do but wait and be patient. which is a concept very hard to grasp when you are trying to keep up with ery single hypetrain out there.

and since they all over sudden realize that they got all their assets into one thing thats not doing anything, they will simply pull out sooner rather than later.

at one point in the normal market fluctuation they will set their limits lower than anticipated and just jump ship.

**group 3**

will eventually do the same, just a little later, simply because they understand the situation better and have much smarter goals. they are in it for the returns. right now they might not be 100% sure what target that is, but they will form a decision really soon. remember, they were never in it for the long run...

**group 2**  
remember, they are in it for the long run anyways. but as said before, patient and REAL investors that see long term potential are kinda rare these days. and not enough are in it right now.

**group 1:**

they are saying they will ride it out until the end. which is great.

&#x200B;

so what does all this mean:

people underestimate how markets work, what strings will and can be pulled. they overestimate patience and conviction.

also, people TOTALLY and utterly fail to understand the core principle of greed, which drives most of the groups mentioned here.

&#x200B;

once the price of each individual involved is reached, the cookie WILL start to crumble.

for some its 500, for most it might be 750, 1000 dollars.

who knows. but this is no situation that will be going on for weeks. this will fade out. simply because most people lose interest or see their chances of high returns dwindling. or they need their money for other investments. or they suddenly realize that putting all this money into something that doesnt pan out wasn´t so smart afterall.

&#x200B;

**OVERALL**

I sincerely hope changes will come- and they probably will.

The current situation clearly exposed how markets are worked and how they operate on a level of transparency, that only happened in 2008.

so how did things change after 2008 ? now think about the ramifications of 2008 compared to this. now try to think - rationaly - how realistic it is that actual , FUNDAMENTAL changes are being established and put into action ?

do you really think they will make short sales illegal ? do you really think they will make naked sales illegal ? do you think they will make fundamental changes to what the SEC actually controls and how they do it ? seriously ?

the only thing that will come from this, MIGHT be:

\- better(harsher) regulations for retail trading platforms

&#x200B;

\- harsher regulations regarding market manupilations through means of social media

&#x200B;

\- a wealth tax for the super rich.

&#x200B;

why this ? because it is easy to sell to the public, build hype and support upon it. will it change anything ? of course not. Oh wait, yes it will. it will make it harder for retail traders. it will make it harder for us.

&#x200B;

more regulations for trade providers means more costs at providing services means no free trading apps anymore. hard to make a buck for trading apps when you cannot sell trade information of your customers to market makers anymore.

&#x200B;

we already are being censored more and more. words are flagged, opinions are flagged, and sooner or later, forums, and whole platforms will be flagged. and then closed and called illegal. its already happening in regards to other platforms. Not that I really care or support anyone using sovial media for dusgusting and absurd poilitical reasons and opinions, but censoring and de-legalizing it is still censorship. thats not something that can be good any democracy.

&#x200B;

and a wealth tax for the super rich? that´s like revers trickle down ecomomics. instead of thinking when they have all their money it will trickle down, we just make sure they pay for it once they have it.

it disregards the fact that simply ba having money, they also have the means to pay lawyers a few millions to find ways they do not have to pay even more millions to pay their taxes. its what´s already happening. this will not help the small , average Joe",2021-01-30 07:50:05
310,Should I get into dividends as an 18 year old?,"TLDR: is it a good idea to start investing young or is this better suited for older people? 

I am a complete beginner to all this unfortunately, I'm part of the new wave brought in by GME. I want to start taking this seriously but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything at the moment. I impulsively bought ~£200 of GME, AMC, and NOK stock. I have no idea if I will lose that money or not, hopefully not but it's not the end of the world if I do. I do have 12 shares of NOK, and I realise now that it may be better to keep them as a long term investment due to 5G etc.

Anyway, regarding dividends: right now I am 18 and put £35,500 into premium bonds. I usually make £25-50 per month, sometimes nothing, sometimes £100+. It guess it's pretty decent. But I feel dividends might be better to invest in over time? In my normal bank account I have about £4.5k spare money to play with.

Would it be worth it to put in say £300-1000 in a dividend portfolio to get started? I can then invest about £20 a month consistently, plus whatever else I can put in at the time. So far I've just been dumping spare cash into my premium bonds, like a few weeks ago I put in 1k, and I was planning on doing the same in a few days but now I'm debating if I should start focusing on dividends instead.

Forget the chance that the stock does reach the targets because Wall Street feels they can last longer and there is still 100%+ shares shorted. 

People donate to charities, churches, gamble on sports etc. so even if it’s just 2 shares of GME or 5 of AMC just buy it and hold. If it goes away write it off but this is the biggest impact you can make with your money to support a chance in the system. 

It’s 2030 wallstreetbets will be the largest hedge fund and everyone can be a part of the club. Stonks are made only to go up!

You may be thinking. Well the can outlast us, BUT MATH. If you are 90% down you need almost 1000% gain to break even again. These clowns are several 1000% down, what will it take to break even? They would have to double down at $300ish and it would take the stock dropping to sub $10 before any calls etc. 

Then there is margin calls and borrow interest to factor in. Also options that will be exercised or the cost basic lost on every Friday.  

There are many people out there that deserve to be filthy rich, and it’s not these hedge funds. The strat now is to buy and hold. Every day we hold, they loose millions then on the close, billions.

Let's use this thread to discuss the GameStop situation this weekend, please don't open new threads about it unless it is a unique perspective or brings very valuable information.

Do note, posts and comments are still restricted to users with a higher Karma and account age.

##Important information

First, let's get some things out of the way:

* The short squeeze has not squoze yet, short interest estimates are still extremely high, I won't post the sources and encourage you to search for it yourself.
* The gamma squeeze has not happened, it may happen Monday, it may happen gradually, it may not happen (if their positions have already been covered), it isn't necessary for anything to happen, however.
* The establishment is still lying about many things for the purpose of market manipulation (Jim Cramer, CNBC, etc.). These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding the situation, they are much less biased! 
* Google and Apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores, put a calendar reminder in 2-6 weeks to add your review at that time, instead of now.

##Let's make a list of the Brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers

The worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers. This, obviously, affected the stock market, tanked those tickers, and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand.

Now, I'm aware the reasons for this are complicated, we know that for many of them, they were forced to restrict these tickers by their Clearing Houses (Apex being the main one), we don't exactly know why, or whether that is legal or not, however.

**One thing for certain, the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very, very, very bad. This, in turns, significantly harmed the public's trust in them, as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this.**

Here is my list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:

### Horrible Brokers - Restricted purchasing of certain tickets and lied/gloated about it

### Note regarding the clearing houses

The first step is to know why brokers restricted the trading. The second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses. Currently, the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues:

* Apex Clearing
* Barclays
* IKBR

We don't know if these firms acted maliciously (protecting themselves before protecting the free market), or because they literally had no choice. If the former, they need to be punished. If the later, then laws need to change. EITHER WAY, something needs to change, this post is merely here to put attention on the problem, I don't claim to have the solution.

Additionally, there needs to be open communication about this issue, currently, they are not saying anything on social media regarding this. Once they do, I'll update this post with it.

Note: /r/ THICC_DICC_PRICC tried to explain this in some detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/). I cannot attest to the accuracy/validity of his explanation, feel free to discuss that on his post.

We might keep this information on the sidebar...forever. Please help me build this list to completion. If you are using a broker in the bad list, even if you are not invested in the tickers that have been restricted, please consider moving to a better broker.

I hope you will make a similar video or tweet if you feel the same way. 

I also wrote my reps to let them know how we can protect the free market. Feel free to reuse for your rep!

Dear Senator Warren,
I hope that you take this opportunity to level the playing field when it comes to the free market.
The definition of the free market is speculation. Every investment vehicle in the market explicitly states that you are at risk of losing value. We do not need further restrictions under the guise of “protection” as retail investors, we instead should be allowed to be on the same playing field. Day trading restrictions should be removed as it grants a distinct advantage to those that can take advantage of momentum swings. Trading certain stocks should never be restricted, regardless of portfolio size.

There instead needs to be more institutional regulation in place to prevent destabilization of the markets and to ensure that the market is truly free. Hedge funds should be required to be fully transparent to allow for better scrutiny to prevent market collapse which almost happened on Jan 28, 2021 when clearing houses lacked the liquidity to cover transactions and margin calls from the meteoric rise of Gamestop’s stock. This volatility was only possible due to the stock being shorted at a 128% rate. This mathematical impossibility will create an infinite short squeeze if the shareholders continue to hold without selling. Had another hedge fund made this contrarian move, it would have been hailed as a genius strategy and be commended. Because it was made by retail, it was instead punished by shutting down trading and allowing institutional transactions only, whose trading was able to drive down the price of this and many other stocks.

There has been immeasurable damage done to any shareholder of $BB, $AMC, $NOK, $GME, $BBBY and any other stocks that were prevented from being purchased during yesterday’s shutdown. This week’s ending option strikes are not true indicators of what the free market would have determined for this week as purchasing has continued to be restricted to miniscule positions.

To make it worse, there is collusion within the media and financial markets to ostracize retail investors and to protect the institutional actors from the consequences of their actions. There needs to be massive institutional changes that should be prioritized over a wealth tax.

Thank You",2021-01-30 13:50:15

I know in my gut it is risky, but it seems like there might be a fair amount of opportunity to avoid losses and see potential large gains.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: Am I crazy for considering timing the stock market in a time of uncertainty and moving my TSP funds from CSI to G?",2021-01-30 14:12:17
319,Robinhood Limitations,"So I just saw that Robinhood opened up the Gamestop, AMC, and Nokia stocks again so I rushed to throw $1K into AMC before we blew it up. However, I think Robinhood has put up a limitation. They're only allowing 1 share in those stocks to be bought by one person at a time. This is total BS and its completely illegal. Is this happening for everybody?",2021-01-30 15:06:33
320,You can get a ticket on a 🚀 to the 🌑 for the same price as a ticket to the movies! $AMC breakout coming.,"I've been over this a couple times, and I'm sure I will again, but I want to make sure you smooth brained autists get the message!

Friday AMC stock close: $13.26. Basically, the same price as a movie ticket.

Here's the data:

1. Stock float (Shares available to be traded): **106.60M**
2. Short float (percent of shorted shares): **41.91%**
3. Average trading volume (Shares traded in a day) including this week's activity: **84.62M**
4. Friday's trading volume (with buy restrictions in place): **594,653,177**
5. Short price **$2.15**

Now you have the data, here's the point...

Short ration is still well over 0.5! That means these bastards aren't giving up. They want to see the stock drop below $3.00, crush the company, and kill the largest employer of high school deadbeats in the country. Some short positions are moving out, but not many. Even with platforms buy restrictions in place the daily volume was 7x the average. 

Aside from the financials, people will be flooding movie theaters soon! People who haven't been to a theater in years will be piling in to see Top Gun 2, The Matrix 4, etc. **BECAUSE THEY CAN!** Movie theaters were taken away from all of us and people will be going back simply because there was a time they couldn't! 

The stronger you 💎🙌 the harder you can squeeze!

I like the stock. I am autist ape, not a financial advisor. Not financial advise. Just my opinion, blah blah blah...
Ape strong together!

tl/dr: AMC to $50! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑",2021-01-30 16:03:33
321,"Concern/questions about the economy if GME, AMC, etc. reach endgame (posted in r/economy too)","Hi everyone, I've already posted this in r/economy but I thought I'd drop it in here too. I've been on Reddit for a while but I never posted until today. I wanted to post on WSB but I did't have enough karma. 

After about a week of following the WSB movement fairly closely a few friends and I started discussing what would happen if GME actually reaches a ridiculously high price of $5k or $10k...or even if it doesn't. Even if these hedge funds were forced to cover at the current price ($325 as I'm typing this), the current market cap is $22.67B. Considering that these corrupt assholes shorted around 140% of the GME stock, there is just no way that they'd be able to cover. Right? Which leads me to believe that even if these giant hedge funds go bust and liquidate to cover, there would still be an outstanding amount of shares that would have to be covered. At that point would the federal government have to step in and cover the rest of the shares? Who's going to pay the people holding shares? I can only think back to 2008 where the federal government bailed out these large hedge funds after they defaulted. The thing that worries me here is that we're only talking about GME. That's not even factoring in AMC, BB or anything else. With that being said, if my assumption is correct (which there is a high chance it isn't), given the current status of the American economy: the trillions of dollars we've spend to deal with the pandemic and the huge unemployment hurdle we have to face, could this possibly be the straw that broke the camel's back? Could we have a big problem brewing here? Again I have no clue if any of this is accurate, that's why I'm here. I've tried searching this up online but I couldn't find anything on this topic. My goal isn't to try to scare anyone, I just genuinely don't know as I'm still trying to understand the monstrous complexity of the stock market and economy in general. I know a lot of you are extremely knowledgeable when it comes to this stuff so I'm asking a helping hand. (Also sorry if some of the terminology I used is incorrect)",2021-01-30 16:42:19

324,"Why Triggering the GameStop ""Infinite Gamma Squeeze"" is a terrible idea.","I'll probably be called a billionaire bootlicker or suits simp by wsb fans for this, but please read and consider all the factors I will lay out here:

(Disclaimer: if you have participated in the GameStop squeeze, some of this may offend you -- but my point is not to shame anyone for having participated, but to those CONTINUING to participate.)

7 Reasons why you should not continue to participate in the GameStop Short Squeeze (or partake in ""hive mind pump and dump schemes"".

#1 Initial Overview

This GameStop short squeeze has to stop, it's currrently collapsing consumer confidence in the market and creating market volatility, and if the infinite squeeze is triggered -- the hedge funds will be forced to liquidate all their positions from the market. What do you think the market will look like after $10-$100+ billion gets liquidated out of the market?

Now you're messing with people's retirement money -- your own family's even, if they have 401k's or Roth IRA's. Don't get me wrong, I invested in GME back in December because I liked where the company was going, their revenue was increasing rapidly, and I heard it could go through a short squeeze. (I didnt realize it would be Worldwide News) I took my profits, but now you have hundreds of thousands of people flooding into the investing market looking to make a quick buck off of GME and AMC -- if you want to gamble, go to a casino.

#2 The Justice Has Already Been Delivered

GameStop and AMC now have raised PLENTY of capital to pull themselves away from bankruptcy, (yay we saved two great companies looking to turn themselves around!) and the hedge funds have been bled of 10-25% of their capital for trying to borderline bankrupt these two companies. I'm pretty sure they've learned their lesson. Government and the SEC have stated that they are heavily monitoring the situation, they will likely have a Congressional Hearing, and punishment will be handed down to those Hegde Funds. 

Now we just need to hold the SEC and Government accountable for implementing regulations against hedge funds. No ""slaps on the wrist"" or warnings. Be aware though -- there are connections in the current administration with Citadel -- the Hedge Fund behind this chaos. This is why we need to watch the SEC and Government closely to see how they handle this.

#3: Making a Mockery of the Stock Market will only hurt Retail Investors and Increase the Wealth Gap.

Personally, I'm just a lower-class normal dude who decided to learn how investing works in April after the market crashed. I saw it as a good time to get in and learn. I've been able to grow my account by over 700%. It has been life changing for me.

So many lower-income investors who have been slowly learning and enjoying making steady gains on the market this past year are growing frustrated with this new ""hive mind"" of retail investors running around ""wHaT wE gOnNa pUmP nExT gUyS?!?!""

This trend has now spilled over into other stocks. Some of them have ""high short interest"" like AMC, Bed Bath and Beyond, sure. But others like Nokia, or (NOK), aren't even being shorted! (15% short interest). So people are now riding this hive mind retail swarm into pumping and dumping on rookie investors. (ie. Dogecoin)

That's not how this stuff works. It's not ""our turn"" to manipulate the market. Play by the rules like everyone else that has respect for the market. Not like every hedge fund that has abused the market. You don't ""pump"" stocks or securities. That's market manipulation.

Research and invest in companies with good momentum, financials, or companies you believe in and want to see do better. Not something someone on the internet told you to buy.

Commonfolk now have the ability to invest and learn -- make money and improve their lives just like all the rich people who have had easy access to the market for a hundred years! We just have to play by the rules!

#5: Triggering the Infinite Gamme Squeeze will bankrupt a couple hedge funds, but also make even bigger Hedge Funds MUCH richer.

One key point the wsb crowd has not even considered is: Look at who the ""long investors"" who are on GameStop. There are some ugly names that stand to profit WAYYYY more than any retail investors will. Is that what we want to do? Bankrupt a few hedge funds and flow more money into bigger ones? Not me.

On top of that, if you don't understand how ""whales"" move markets, what do you think will happen if GameStop shoots to some epic number? Do you think you'll be able to sell and collect your profits before the billion dollar investment groups with fancy ass computers (and algorithms programmed to lock in an exit strategy) sell before you? Doubt it.

#6: We are literally recreating history... Bad History

The people treating the market like a pump and dump casino have no respect for history. Remember the financial collapse of Germany's Weimar Republic back in the 1920's? Read the book ""When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany""

Here are a couple excerpts from that book:

""Gambling on the stock exchange had became the fashion-- the only way to avoid losing all one's money and perhaps to add to it. Many new bankers were giving people advice, the flight from the krone governing all transactions.""

""the large numbers of unemployed, their passions fermented by the Communists, are seething with discontent ... a mob has attempted to set the Parliament building on fire.""

Sound a little familiar...? the Weimar Republic at the time was also going through a stretch of partisan political extremism. We've also been printing money like crazy. I dont know about you, but I don't want to see our country's financial system collapse.

#7: Hypothetical Conspiracy Theory (Put on your tinfoil thinking cap)

Lastly, the CEO of Citadel, the hedge fund overlooking all of this chaos. Look him up -- I would NOT be surprised if the GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze was a foreign adversary's psy-op to get us to collapse our entire stock market. I know that sounds like a conspiracy theory, but just consider it.

We've already had our health system collapsed by this foreign adversary, we've already had our government, universities, and businesses infiltrated by this foreign adversary all in the last 10 yearrs. (Plenty of Department of Justice links I can share with you if you need proof of that) Why wouldn't they coordinate a stock market crash as well?

If you really wanna ""stick it to the hedge funds"" -- Learn how to invest, research good stocks/cryptos/investments, make money the honest way, and SHRINK THE WEALTH GAP through dedicated reading and learning. Not by following stupid hive mind retail pump and dumps.

TL:DR - To the people trying to trigger an infinite squeeze so they can bleed the entire market dry into their pockets -- this makes you NO better than the hedge funds who did it to our country in 2008-2009. You're just putting our financial system on the brink of collapse. Just gonna end up one side of the same ugly coin -- the same paradigm we hate about our government.

I just want to close this by saying thank you if you made it through this novel of an essay. If there are any people who would like to provide counter opinions to anything I said, please feel free -- I am not a financial expert and have only been reading about this stuff since March.

(I am also not your financial advisor)",2021-01-30 18:26:22
325,AMC next phase:,"Hey all! Copying the text from poster since I cant post images here. 

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30Jan2021): AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target on 1/29 was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.39! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday) 

So Monday when they're forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. Their are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (Wed) 3.2 days (Thurs) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover. 

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short  at $13. The percentage is significantly higher and there's a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

I am just an ape and you do what you want with your money, I am not a financial advisor. I hope this helped some of you understand what's going on.",2021-01-30 20:32:25

What are your thoughts on AMC?

What are your favorite stocks? I like TSLA, SPCE, FLGT, and VSTO. They've been my money makers. The travel companies, being the main airlines and cruises, have been good investments as they all dropped heavily after the shutdowns and been creeping back up. A few started to drop again though with talks of possible shutdowns and travel restrictions.

FYI, Fidelity has been a good app to use for trading. What's your app of choice?",2021-01-30 23:42:52
329,Does AMC actually have legitimate potential to grow as high as people claim?,"My first experience with the stock market was a bit of a warped one with GME shooting from 10-20 up to like 400 in a matter of days. This actually got my interested in the stock market and I've done my best to understand the reasons behind why that happened and just try grasp some basic fundamentals.

Seeing AMC being hyped up by the same group of people that hyped GME I placed an order for a bunch at 10 dollars when the pre market was still at 6-8 and then it skyrocketed to a pre market of 20 dollars. I got scared and thoughts I'd miss the bus if I didn't buy right then and there and so I bought at about 18 and the value instantly tanked. 

Obviously AMC is a side show to the main event GME but based off what I've been able to find the market seems to be incredibly shorted. I see this site being thrown around a lot [https://www.highshortinterest.com](https://www.highshortinterest.com) and again I'm really not sure how credible it is. There are lots of claims that this is the week AMC is gonna sky rocket and as much as I want to believe them I want to know just how credible/likely it is that we could see AMC hit 30/40 or even 50 this week.

Even if the value tanks I suppose I've learnt my lesson about buying in to hyped stocks and to do actual legitimate research before hand. AMC's peaks pre covid were hitting upwards of 30 as well so really this isn't a complete loss.",2021-01-30 23:43:55

333,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

I ran this calculation after seeing different AMC short interest figures on various websites. ***I believe true AMC short interest is actually 10-15%***, which is significantly lower than what Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, etc. are saying (79% on Market Watch, 38% on Yahoo Finance, at the time of writing this post).

**Since AMC's Q3’20 filing which was released on 11/05/20, they’ve issued a shit ton of shares through the below means, which I don't think these finance websites are accounting for:**

1. Raising $917mm in debt and equity through December and January; in a 1/22/201 filing they stated they had 287.3mm Class A shares outstanding ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html))
2. Silver Lake Partners (a now past investor) converting their debt to equity and selling out last week, represented 44.2mm new Class A shares hitting the market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E))
3. Upcoming automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares held by Dalian Wanda, a Chinese investor, represents 46.1mm new Class A shares that will hit the market soon (page S-18, [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf)).
4. Additionally, last week AMC filed to sell an additional 50mm Class A shares into the market ([https://deadline.com/2020/12/struggling-amc-entertainment-files-to-sell-50-million-more-shares-1234662800/](https://deadline.com/2020/12/struggling-amc-entertainment-files-to-sell-50-million-more-shares-1234662800/))

**Here is my calculation for short interest, including links to filings from the Company for reference:**

1. (A) 287,276,558 Class A Common Stock Outstanding as of 1/22/2021 + (B) 51,796,784 Class B Common Stock will automatically convert to Class A Common Stock at 1:1 ratio because on 12/14/2020 Dalian Wanda Group's holdings of Class B Common Stock fell to 30% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock + (C) AMC filed to sell an additional 50,000,00 Class A Common Stock into the market -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf), page 1 and page S-18
2. Silver Lake Group converted $600mm of Convertible Senior Secured Notes into 44,422,860 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Silver Lake then sold all those shares into the market last week. 5,666,000 of the Class B Common Stock outstanding then got cancelled as part of this conversion -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf), page 2 || [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf), page 12
3. Looks like \~44.7mm shares are sold short
4. Total shares outstanding (excl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing) = 287,276,558 + 44,422,860 = 331,699,418
5. Total shares outstanding (incl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing (which they will probably complete given the high stock price)) = 331,699,418 + 51,796,784 - 5,666,000 + 50,000,000 = 427,830,202
6. Looks like \~3.0 shares are held by management / insiders, so float and short interest on #4 above = 328,704,636 / 13.6% short interest; and on #5 above = 424,835,420 / 10.5% short interest

***In summary, I think AMC is way overhyped and those looking for a short squeeze may still realize one, but at a much lower magnitude than they might believe. Focus should be on forcing the GME short squeeze, which still looks to have +100% short interest.***

Appreciate any and all discussion. My thoughts are my own, this is not financial advice, yada yada yada...",2021-01-31 08:44:48
336,Kinepolis DD (EBR:KIN),"I decided to write a small DD-piece on Kinepolis (**EBR:KIN**) since I’ve seen commenters on this subreddit, and other stock market-related subs, wanting to diversify their portfolio with European stocks, but being unsure what exactly to invest in. Coupled with the current hype around AMC, I thought this would be a fun little DD to write up as well.

Before the pandemic, KIN was worth around €60 ($72.8). It fell to €30 ($36.4) when COVID-19 reached Europe and, later, North-America. It took another hit in October when it became clear current COVID-19 measures would last into 2021. For the last couple of months, KIN has been hovering around €35 ($42.5). I believe Kinepolis has significantly more potential than its North-American competitors and will quickly reach €60 again once the economy opens up again. Before the pandemic, its worth was almost double that of Cinemark Holdings, INC (CNK) and triple that of AMC and IMAX.

The Kinepolis Group operates 111 cinemas: 10 in the US, 45 in Canada, and 56 in Europe - this amounts to a total of 1,081 screens. Its core businesses consists of box office-movies, cultural events (think theater, art movies, film festivals, etc.), B2B (Kinepolis provides for conferences, premieres, and other corporate events), film distribution, and advertising. So far, pretty ordinary stuff for a cinema chain. 

Kinepolis distinguishes itself from its competitors through its real estate business (similar to McDonald’s strategy). They own the majority of their real estate and they rent out venues to shops, restaurants, and cafes in their cineplexes. Basically, what this means is that Kinepolis is not burdened with enormous rents while having little revenue during the pandemic. It recently also got approved for an €80 million loan. All-in-all, the company is in good shape despite the pandemic. Considering the company’s financial stability (and future prospects), I could possibly see Kinepolis win ground in the US with the other cinema groups struggling financially. It already acquired the American group MJR Digital Cinemas in 2019 and bought Canada’s Landmark Cinemas in 2017, for example.

The group is also quick to pick up on innovations within the industry like adopting new sound systems and laser technologies. In 2018, Kinepolis adopted Cinionic’s world’s first 4K smart laser. This was about 1-2 years earlier than its competitors. Fun fact: it built the world’s first megaplex in Brussels.

Like others have pointed out before me, I genuinely believe people are yearning to go back to the movies. Cinema-going is very much ingrained in Western culture and will, moreover, be one of the more affordable outing-options as well (a huge plus considering the economic situation). Once the vaccination process picks up and restrictions loosen people will be going to the movies again. Personally speaking, I’m an avid movie-goer and Kinepolis’ cinemas are some of the best out there (with a wide range of snacks and drinks, not always common in European cinemas).

The bearish take on this is of course people staying hesitant to go to the movies again (although Kinepolis takes its COVID-19 precautions seriously, at least in Belgium) and that the movie industry doesn’t pick as quickly. Although they did some re-runs of old movies when they were briefly allowed to open again during the summer, it didn’t pull as many people as they had hoped. New movies like Tenet were successful, however.

On 25 February, Kinepolis will publish its annual results of 2020 which will be interesting to follow.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. As has been mentioned ad nauseam: do your own DD. But I do believe in the possibilities of this company because of my research coupled with my personal feelings about this industry and Kinepolis.

337,Short term investing next week in the volatile meme stocks,"You can ignore the $GME explanation unless you feel strongly about it, I’m not as interested In that case as I am the others, I’ve read countless articles on it and still don’t feel like I understand it very well so I’m wary of getting involved. 

I’m more interested in the short/medium term possible outcomes of the other stocks like AMC, BB, NOK, etc. I realize their situations are different where their floats are considerably less, etc. I feel they are safer because I’m not looking for “+1800%” gains or anything of the sort and in the event of a dip or “crash” their price is not expected to tank to the same extent as GME which is astronomically inflated due to what’s currently going on. As I see it there’s less risk and less reward and there’s also the potential long on these stocks if there is not satisfactory short term gains. 

So my question is, I already have a few hundred in AMC stock from around $13/share buy in. At opening Monday if/when some of these stocks take a dip from the weekend orders I plan to potentially invest up to another $1000. Where might this money best be spent? I’m not part of the group that believes GMB $1000+ or AMC $40+ etc. My optimistic expectations are probably half that. For someone wanting to turn say 120-150% profit ideally and “minimize risk” (I’m fully aware I can lose all of this money and that’s okay, but I’d rather lose some and have to go long on a lesser stock than lose every penny on GMB) which of the others is likely my best bet?",2021-01-31 11:04:36

SoFi has been fighting to keep meme stock buying open and unrestricted. When a back end provider moved to turn it off, SoFi protested and got the stocks opened back up. No purchase limits.

SoFi Members were able to purchase GME and AMC every day of the week!

SoFi's CEO declared ""[GME and AMC are NOT restricted \[at\] SoFi](https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/status/1354879252303286273)"" and has vowed to do everything SoFi can to prevent buying limitations.

SoFi is embracing the flood of new Member interest. They have launched a Twitter ad blitz. Targeting appears to include Dave Portnoy and Chamath's audiences.

SoFi's app started last week ranked around 100 on the app store's Finance ladder. They jumped to \~50 in a day, then \~20, and are now ranked 13th! All within the space of a week. Once they break the top-10, the app will appear on first page.

SoFi's CEO was previously the COO of Twitter. SoFi knows how to scale for this moment!

347,AMC Leaps- Any ideas on fundamentals?,"I believe there's a fairly sound case for AMC to bounce back in a significant way beyond the current short squeeze or meme bump. I'm very interested in getting some Leaps on AMC if the IV comes down a bit. Here's my thoughts:

1) Upside: Vaccine rollout. We are probably 3-6 months from normalcy and full reopening. Many studios have been holding back releases from covid-19, and plan to release them after reopening. This could be a recipe for a huge summer box office take, especially considering the desire of my folks to get out and get back to normal.

2) Streaming replacing theaters may not happen as quickly as anticipated. Take a look at the box office of wonder woman 1984. Although it drove a huge bump in subscriptions for hbo, it only grossed $150 million in box office take. The original grossed over $800 million. This seems like a huge incentive for studios to continue to work with theaters. Hard to imagine even Disney doing a streaming only release for a marvel movie and leaving money on the table. Perhaps the studios will raise the value of theaters and form strategic partnerships.

3) Finance: Amc has been able to convert is stock price into a real financial lifeline. They've already raised $300 million and closed out over $600 million in existing debt by selling equity. Considering they had less than $700 million in assets in q2 2020, this is a huge cash infusion and should definitely help them weather the storm door the next few months until business picks back up.

4) Negatives : Real estate value. Theatres are purpose built and hard to offload to raise cash. With few alternative land uses, the value of underperforming theaters in malls, etc could be a liability. Minimum wage is also a big potential threat in the next year, but could be offset with automation.

Any other thoughts? I think calls dated at least 6-12 months out could be a solid play after this squeeze cools off.",2021-01-31 18:07:41

Markets Look Like They’re in a Bubble. What Do Investors Do Now?

For once, everyone seems to agree: Much of the market looks like it’s in a bubble.

Shares of unprofitable companies like GameStop Corp. GME 67.87% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC 53.65% are rising at a breakneck pace, propelled by a growing army of individual investors. Options activity is surging, bitcoin prices are near records and businesses are rushing to opportunistically sell stock through a flurry of initial public offerings, listings of blank-check companies and follow-on share sales.

To many, valuations look stretched as they hover at levels similar to the highflying days of 2000. That said, high valuations alone don’t necessarily mean the rally is near its end, investors say. History has shown that markets have often been able to climb far longer than thought possible, be it the dot-com boom in the late 1990s or the dizzying rise in Japanese stocks in the 1980s.

And recently, the broader stock market has been on the decline. The S&P 500 dropped 3.3% last week, though it remains up 66% from its March low. The bubblelike behavior there has mostly been contained to a handful of individual stocks, not larger indexes.

Single-Stock Bubbles

Fast-moving stocks such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings and BlackBerry have raised concerns of excessive exuberance in pockets of the market, while the S&P 500 largely remains unchanged.

An even bigger issue arguing against a marketwide bubble is simple math. With interest rates at rock bottom and further stimulus on the table, many investors are being handsomely rewarded by putting their money into riskier, higher-yielding assets. What’s more, in many cases earnings have held up or been robust, despite a global pandemic.

That combination of factors has helped push investor optimism. Bullishness on stocks among money managers is at a three-year high, according to a recent Bank of America survey of 194 money managers who oversee $561 billion in assets. Meanwhile, the average share of cash in portfolios—typically a safeguard against market turmoil—is at the lowest level since May 2013.

Nonetheless, investors are trying to identify what could cause bubbles among individual stocks to pop and whether any of the bursts will spread to the wider market. Next week, investors will get a look at fresh data on the manufacturing sector, earnings from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -0.97% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG -1.47% and the January employment report.

“You know, this one has checked off all the boxes from a history book,” said Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of Boston money manager Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co., who predicted the market crashes of 2000 and 2008. Mr. Grantham has been calling the current market overheated since last year.

But even he concedes the timing of a market top is difficult.

“We know each bubble is a little bit different and, with the help of new trading platforms and the internet, it could set more records,” he said.

Mr. Grantham isn’t alone in his worries. Nearly 90% of some 627 market professionals think some financial markets are in a bubble, according to a recent Deutsche Bank survey. Meanwhile, Google searches for the term “stock market bubble” reached an all-time high in January.

Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust, says his company, concerned about stretched valuations in the U.S., has been gradually shifting more money into stocks elsewhere.

Lately, “the market has not been correlated to the macro picture,” he said.

New Year Anxieties

Google searches for 'stock market bubble' reached an all-time high in January.

While the moves of some stocks and assets have been jarring, analysts and investors say they aren’t surprised by the freewheeling, speculative activity in the financial markets.

A super-accommodative Federal Reserve, low interest rates and, more recently, optimism on the coronavirus vaccine and economy have underpinned much of the buying by investors during the past 11 months. Many Americans built up their savings during the pandemic—and stand to gain even more if Congress follows through on another stimulus package. And the prospect of low returns in most other assets has driven investors to buy stocks more aggressively.

Add to that, more individual investors are trading than ever before. Those investors threw their weight around last year by shocking Wall Street veterans with a rash of irrational stock picks, including Hertz Global Holdings Inc., HTZGQ 7.36% which spiked nearly 900% from its low to its high in the wake of filing for bankruptcy protection.

This year’s encores have been even more stunning. On Wednesday alone, 24.5 billion shares and 57.1 million options contracts changed hands, a record driven by individual investors, according to Rich Repetto, a managing director in Piper Sandler & Co. GameStop shares more than doubled that day, briefly giving shares of the beleaguered videogame retailer a more than 1,700% gain since the year’s start.

“This is merely one example of what’s becoming dozens of dozens,” Mr. Grantham said. Other retail darlings include AMC, which jumped more than 300% Wednesday, and BlackBerry Ltd. , whose stock the same day notched its biggest gain in more than 17 years.

The Blank-Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

The Blank-Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

Private companies are flooding to special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, to bypass the traditional IPO process and gain a public listing. WSJ explains why some critics say investing in these so-called blank-check companies isn’t worth the risk. Illustration: Zoë Soriano/WSJ

Companies are rushing to get in on the action.

Companies have raised $13.4 billion through 24 IPOs so far this year, a 300% jump in listings from the same period last year, according to Renaissance Capital data. Blank-check companies continued to flood the market, with 91 gathering about $25 billion, nearly a third of the value raised throughout all of last year, according to SPACinsider.com. And there have been 111 offerings of additional shares by U.S.-listed companies, doubling the number from the same period a year earlier, Dealogic data show.

Usually, such frenzied activity would lead big money managers to pull back from stocks. But many argue that shares of GameStop, AMC and other highflying stocks represent their own bubbles—and don’t pose a threat to the entire financial ecosystem. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.40% say the run-up in unprofitable stocks, which they say make up about 5% of the overall market, poses little risk of contagion.

“These stocks don’t make up the bulk of the stock market,” said Samantha McLemore, a portfolio manager at $3.5 billion money-manager Miller Value Partners. “There are so many areas of the market that we’re finding attractively valued.”

At first glance, investors’ go-to for measuring valuations, price-to-earnings ratios, suggests the market looks expensive.

The S&P 500 currently trades at 22 times projected earnings during the next 12 months, not far off from the 25 times the index traded at in 2000, just before the dot-com crash, according to FactSet.

But that’s only part of the picture. That level looks less concerning once low interest rates and earnings, which are expected to grow, are factored in, several investors and analysts said.

One simple explanation for why investors haven’t pulled back more?

“We’ve seen it in the past—if you think you have a bubble and sell too soon, that can be a very costly trade,” said Mr. Braakman of First American Trust.

350,Another thread about next week,"So I'm another noob who is lurking the stock subs because of the GME frenzy. It's been really interesting seeing the different takes on what's been going down and what's going to happen next week. r/wallstreetbets has some really great info but also lots of 12 year olds and bots, so it's hard to know what's real or have a real conversation. So I'm hoping yall can help me out and give me your opinions on the following:

1) r/wallstreetbets is convinced that next week GME will rise to at least $1000. I know enough to know thats pretty crazy, but with all the unnatural enthusiasm and attention, plus retail buying was throttled last week. Theres also the short stock percentage, which is being debated on. What are yalls opinions on the likelihood of it reaching $1000? What do you think will be the peak?

2) they're also heavily stoked about AMC. They aren't pretending it's the new GME, but they think it will rise to $50-$100 next week. They think there will be a squeeze plus massive retail buying. There definitely seems to be enthusiasm for it. What do yall think will happen with AMC? And what will it peak be?

3) S3 just came out saying the short stock percentage is a lot lower than last week. r/wallstreetbets doesn't believe the numbers, and honestly they seem to have a decent argument. S3s update contradicted their info from earlier and Friday. Also the amount of shorted stock cleared doesn't seem possible with the amount of volume traded Friday (30m short covered out of 50m). Do you think r/wallstreetbets are kidding themselves? Or do they have a point? Also, call me cynical but I have no problem believing the hedge funds would bribe S3 to give out false information on a Sunday night.

Full disclosure, I bought one GME share just to be part of the fun. I'm not expecting any kind of return and I'm cool with losing it. I'm just interested and would like some honest opinions.",2021-01-31 21:10:01

355,WSJ: GameStop Day Traders Are Moving Into SPACs,"Well, here they come hold on to your seats girls. Even CCIV has a mention. Chamath too. 

ARTICLE (abbreviated):

[WSJ:  GameStop Day Traders Are Moving Into SPACs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-day-traders-are-moving-into-spacs-11612175401)

Day traders fueling enormous gains in popular stocks such as GameStop Corp. GME 67.87% are also powering big swings for another suddenly hot investment: so-called blank-check companies. 

Special-purpose acquisition companies—shell companies planning to merge with private firms to take them public—are rising more than 6% on average on their first day of trading in 2021, up from last year’s figure of 1.6%, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. Before 2020, trading in SPACs was muted when they made their debut on public markets. 

Now, shares of blank-check companies almost always go up. The last 140 SPACs to go public have either logged gains or ended flat on their opening day of trading, per a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of trading in blank-check companies through Thursday. One hundred and seventeen in a row have risen in their first week. The gains tend to continue, on average generating bigger returns going out to a few months. 

The gains in companies that don’t yet have any underlying business underscore the wave of speculation in today’s markets. Merging with a SPAC has become a popular way for startups in buzzy sectors to go public and take advantage of investor enthusiasm for futuristic themes.

But lately, day traders are even putting money into SPACs before they have revealed what company they are buying. At that stage, they are pools of cash, so investors are wagering that the company will eventually complete an attractive deal. 

Despite the risks, many are embracing the trade, underscoring how online investing platforms and social-media groups now send individuals flocking to new corners of markets, including shares of unprofitable companies such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC 53.65% That trend also is playing out in everything from shares of silver miners to SPACs, which were relatively rare before last year but are suddenly ubiquitous in finance. “I would just have a bad case of FOMO if I wasn’t in SPACs,” said Marco Prieto, a 23-year-old real-estate agent living in Tucson, Ariz., referring to the fear of missing out that is driving many individuals to put money into markets.

He has a roughly $50,000 portfolio and about 60% of his holdings tied to blank-check companies. Some of his positions are early on in shell firms such as Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. VI, while others are based on rumors tied to possible deals by companies including Churchill Capital Corp. IV.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/05bjlwom0ve61.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=7df4064e2799ed07d29f21944c621d77fb6f8c1a

Shares of that company have more than doubled since Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 11 that it is in talks to combine with electric-car firm Lucid Motors Inc. Trading got so frenzied that the SPAC put out a statement a week later saying it wouldn’t comment on the report and that it is always evaluating a number of possible deals. The stock has still been gyrating in the days since. Investors betting on SPACs even before such reports is extraordinary because the underlying value of a blank-check firm before it pursues a deal is the amount of money it raises for a public listing. That figure is typically pegged at $10 a share. 

Still, it has become common for investors to buy at higher prices such as $11 or $12 to back big-name SPAC founders such as venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya and former Citigroup Inc. deal maker Michael Klein. In another sign blank-check firms are now frequently traded by individuals, several SPACs and companies that have merged with them recently joined GameStop and AMC on a list of stocks that have position limits on Robinhood Markets Inc., a popular brokerage for day traders. Those restricted include Mr. Klein’s Churchill Capital IV and a few of Mr. Palihapitiya’s SPACs in the Social Capital Hedosophia SPCE 2.74% franchise.

Mods: thanks for allowing this to be posted, it clearly is not pumping any of the companies that have recently gone up by 3000%",2021-02-01 07:28:07
356,"Emotional involvement has never been this high, please understand the risk involved.","First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. 

I'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. 

And a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.

To the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.

So let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): 

>Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect—I certainly expected—to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.

>But here’s what Citadel Securities’ retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1

>[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)


>Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.

>What do you make of that? One reading would be: “Retail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they’re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.” Or as one Twitter user put it, “past the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.”



So, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  

**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  
You, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  

This thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    

**Emotions**
The problem with this whole ""strike back at wall street"" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. 

Want to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.

TLDR: 

1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. 

2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.

3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  

Lastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole ""fight the hedge funds"" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.

358,AMC: A Different Kind of Investing,"AMC holds sentimental value to me. I grew up going to movie theaters with friends, and I think it holds sentimental value with plenty of you as well. It’s one thing for a company to fail due to bad business, and it's another for it to fail due to a random, unexpected, unpreventable pandemic.

These last few weeks have taught the retail investor, and everyone, a valuable lesson. It was really only a matter of time until something like this occurred: that the internet would form a substantial community of ongoing communication large enough to eventually take on larger financial institutions. The retail investor has never had this much buying power ever before, and because of the nature of the internet, I see that as being unlikely to change. Thus the stock market has become, and will become, more reflective of a democracy. Middle class individuals, when working together, have the power to make the changes we want to see in the stock market. We can save the companies we want to save.

Now, none of this is to say that fundamentals don't matter. Fundamentals matter. But, not only do fundamentals affect stock prices, but stock prices (can) affect fundamentals. A projected growth for a corporation can be self fulfilling. An increasing stock price (which has been suppressed by short sellers), can open many new opportunities for AMC and truly be a game changer for their business.

America’s entertainment industry is the largest in the world and an integral piece of our economy. Do we the people want to allow movie theaters to become a thing of the past? I don't. And with a Democratic Spirit, I will vote with my money for a future I'd like to see.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Of course, this strategy, of creating value vs finding value, is not for every investor. But I think there is a paradigm shift occurring, where there is a new possibility of helping companies we like. Feel free to disagree with any of this, I'd just like to hear your thoughts.",2021-02-01 10:05:31

Do not fear and panic sell. If you pay attention to most stocks trending on WSB, they were moving up and down simultaneously. When GME was down like 100 points AMC was down 10 points and BB 7 points. When GME moved up a little bit AMC, BB would also move up. Wall Street is trying to get you to Sell after a big dip and a little recovery. Psychologically they WANT TO. Scare you

since last week being manipulated by Wall Street. 

With the restriction of how much you can buy is restricting your gains and causing you manipulated losses. YOU ONLY LOSE IF YOU SELL!

TIME is the enemy for Wall Street because they can continue restricting purchase and manipulating the price down but they still have to cover and pay interest

Been supporting the WSB fight against the Hedge Funds since I found out about it around a week ago. Then I found this information a few hours ago, and it has me worried for the people indefinitely holding, with the expectation of a squeeze coming soon. I'm new to the stock market but have learned a bit in the last week. Am I reading this wrong, or have the percentage of shorted shares dropped to 49.21%?

If the squeeze already happened last ~~friday~~ thursday, how is lying about it or hiding this information to keep people buying/holding GME stock, to increase personal profits, ANY different then the bullshit that Hedge Funds do? That is active manipulation and deception for personal gain, not an altruistic attempt to 'take down Goliath', which is why many people (myself included) supported/support the GME/AMC fight.

Even ASKING for people to explain this information to me has resulted in mass downvotes, ZERO direct responses explaining why I am wrong, and a post I made about it on WSB, was deleted within 30 seconds by mods.

Is this a ""David vs. Goliath"" type of fight, or essentially a Ponzi scheme for people who invested early and/or with large funds?

Am I crazy/wrong, or is ignorance and greed now fueling this 'movement'? ***ANY*** explanation is greatly appreciated.

edit- Shoutout to the mods here for reinstating this post after it was initially removed. The mods over at WSB shadowbanned me after I asked the same question.

363,WALLSTREET DIRTY TACTICS- Price of a stock goes up or down based on supply and demand. READ to see why AMC and GME have not yet 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 because of the illegal fraud Wallstreet and brokers like RH are doing,"A stock price goes up or down based on demand and supply. When there’s a great supply (selling) and low demand (people not interested in purchasing) the price of the stock goes down. 

When there’s high demand (people interested in buying) and low supply (low selling) the price of the stock goes up because people are willing to pay higher prices making the stock goes up 

The ILLEGAL MANIPULATION Wall Street is doing is that there’s HIGH DEMAND around the world to PURCHASE stock BUT by RESTRICTING how much you purchase WALLSTREET is illegally creating a LOW DEMAND of the stock MAKING IT GO DOWN IN PRICE!

if there were no restrictions you can see ppl around the world want to get in and buy. Therefore these BIG DIPS  MAKE NO SENSE unless there’s MANIPULATION. 

If walstreet wasn’t manipulating the stock, with the high demand there is. AMC AND GME WOULDVE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 by now. 


Thus, COMPLAIN, HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕. We will reach the moon. It may take a while LONGER due to ILLEGAL PLAY by wallstreet but they WILL JOT BE ABLE TO STOP AND STEAL FROM US",2021-02-01 15:38:24
364,"TD ""news"" alert on AMC stock Ticker (clear misinformation tactics)"," 17:22:00 Reddit Users Fuel Rally in Silver -- 4th update.

 

Online investors who spurred a trading frenzy in the shares of GameStop        Corp. and AMC        Entertainment Holdings Inc. have moved onto the global silver        market, powering the precious metal to its biggest one-day advance in        more than a decade.     

Futures prices for silver in New        York on Monday settled at their highest level in eight years,        the latest work by a loosely knit group of speculators who congregate on        social-media platforms including Reddit's WallStreetBets. Some        participants have been contending aggressive buying could power GameStop-like,        quadruple-digit percentage gains in other arenas, with some chatter over        the weekend focusing on the roughly $50 billion market        for silver investments.     

The idea of buying silver in unison was mentioned in the popular Reddit        forum WallStreetBets last week, then quickly spread to other corners of        the internet, even as many Reddit users said they weren't behind the        silver-market advance. Many investors piled into silver bars and coins        online, along with silver-linked exchange traded-funds and shares of        silver producers.     

Many traders with experience in commodities say the trade is highly        speculative. There is more than enough silver to meet industrial demand        for everything from semiconductors to solar panels, and producers can        raise output to take advantage of higher prices. Previous efforts to        corner the market have ultimately preceded crashes, most famously when        the Hunt brothers are alleged to have artificially boosted silver in        1979 and 1980.     

Still, the recent wave of speculation is unlike anything many in        commodities have witnessed in the recent past. Shares of miners like First        Majestic Silver Corp. and Hecla        Mining Co. have been among the stock market's best performers        recently -- each rose more than 20% on Monday -- while the largest        exchange-traded fund tied to silver logged its biggest-ever daily inflow        on Friday. Online silver dealers around the country have even reported        soaring demand from retail buyers.     

""It's become like the GameStop        of commodities,"" said Edward Meir, a consultant        focused on metals at brokerage ED&FMan Capital Markets.        ""It doesn't make any sense...It could be equally ugly on the way down.""     

The most actively traded silver futures advanced 9.3% to $29.42        a troy ounce, ending the day at a nearly eight-year high after briefly        rising above $30 earlier in the trading session. Prices        have risen nearly 15% in the past week, and Monday's climb marked the        metal's biggest advance since 2009.     

Silver's rally echoed the recent leap in GameStop        and AMC, propelled by a phalanx of individual traders gathering online.        Highlighting the risks associated with these trades, GameStop        shares fell more than 30% to $225 on Monday. Shares of        the struggling videogame retailer are still up some 1,100% in the past        month as traders undertake a ""short squeeze,"" forcing investors who had        bet on share-price declines to buy back stock at higher prices to        minimize their losses. That trend can add further fuel to rallies.     

Professional traders are now weighing whether the flurry of demand from        individuals can sustain the climb in silver -- a market where trading is        still concentrated in a small group of banks.     

""They can cause very significant disruption because silver is a market        with a history of very, very high volatility,"" said Tai Wong,        head of metal derivatives trading at BMO Capital Markets.        ""But can they replicate a GameStop?        Unlikely.""     

The acting chairman of the Commodity        Futures Trading Commission, which regulates markets for silver        futures, said the agency is watching the action closely.     

""The commission is communicating with fellow regulators, the exchanges,        and stakeholders to address any potential threats to the integrity of        the derivatives markets for silver, and remains vigilant in surveilling        these markets for fraud and manipulation,"" Rostin Behnam,        the acting chairman, said in a statement Monday.     

Silver's climb to start the week was even more remarkable to market        watchers because gold rose only 0.7% and trading in other commodities        was muted. Gold and silver often trade in similar directions and are        seen as safe-haven investments during times of market turmoil.     

Depositories at CME        Group's Comex -- the biggest marketplace for silver futures -- are        brimming with almost 400 million troy ounces of silver, valued at around $12        billion at Monday's prices. Vaults in London        housed 1.1 billion troy ounces -- worth $29 billion -- at        the end of 2020, according to the London Bullion Market Association.     

Monday's advance followed a weekend rush to buy the physical metal --        which is used in electronics, jewelry and photography. Retail silver        marketplaces including Money Metals and APMEX Inc. had        notices on their websites Sunday saying they were unable to process new        orders until markets opened because of unprecedented demand.     

On Monday, many popular sites for purchasing silver and gold reported        shipping delays or other purchase restrictions.     

""Precious metals have never seen such a sudden surge in new interest,""        said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault.        Over the weekend, openings of new accounts at the online marketplace for        gold and silver rose to almost four times the daily average from 2020,        itself a record year since BullionVault went live in 2005, he said.     

Many traders and analysts are baffled by the moves in silver and said        the logic behind a ""short squeeze"" is also questionable.     

In GameStop's case, hedge        funds that had bet against the stock were forced to buy the retailer's        shares when individual investors drove the price higher to avoid bigger        losses, propelling the shares even more. But for silver, hedge funds and        other speculators actually have a net long position and stand to benefit        from rising prices, Commodity        Futures Trading Commission data show.     

""This is just a speculative boom,"" said Georgette Boele,        senior precious-metals strategist at ABN Amro Bank.     

A broad attempt by day traders to corner the market in silver wouldn't        be the first time someone has tried to dominate the precious metals        market. Analysts have alleged price manipulation in the silver market        going back several decades, including the episode with the Hunt brothers        more than four decades ago.     

Traders are also watching big inflows into the largest ETF tied to        silver, the iShares Silver Trust, and other large funds. These funds and        mining stocks are the easiest ways for individuals to bet on higher        prices. The fact that silver futures themselves are rising shows that        professionals are also trying to profit from the current excitement,        traders say.     

ETF buying can also add to market momentum because the traders who        manage the fund must buy physical silver when investors put more money        into the ETF. As a result, large inflows signal that the metals are in        high demand.     

Still, many professionals warn the silver rally will also end badly.     

""It's devoid of any fundamentals,"" Mr. Meir        said

365,Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies),"I posted this TWNK long thesis in r/stocks, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/), but think it has a home in r/options as well given the 15% short interest, low IV, cheap options, and potential for gamma squeeze. Appreciate any and all thoughts.

# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

[https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue](https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue)


# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won’t see a squeeze of GME’s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call “asymmetric upside” (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I’ll describe below.

**So what’s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can’t make this up)…

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there’s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what’s the thesis?** We think there’s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** – Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we’re aware of (can’t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** – Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If you’re looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** – There’s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing – and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crème wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the “better-for-you” snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess’ existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company’s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company’s largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don’t think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you’re looking for a little diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from other holdings you may have. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***",2021-02-01 17:34:19

368,15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight),"Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national securities exchange -- (2) To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange, any security not so registered, or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades and https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, shall be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction.""

I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Your Average Retail Investor

369,Fubo stock on track to hit $200,"Over the past few weeks, fuboTV has been caught up in the huge short-squeeze rattling through the markets because, well, the stock is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market.

In the first half of December, fuboTV’s stock more than doubled over two weeks on the back of super-strong subscriber numbers. The strength in fuboTV’s subscriber base broadly foreshadows its huge role in the live TV streaming world.

On the heels of that huge rally, multiple short-sellers targeted FUBO. The favored argument amongst bears is that demand for live TV is dying, the streaming platform itself is commoditized and the business model is built on broken economics. Fubo’s short interest currently sits at about 65% of the float.

Then, the Reddit-inspired short-squeeze broke out. It wasn’t just GME stock that went flying. All heavily shorted stocks flew alongside GME stock. FUBO stock, with 65% of its float sold short, was a beneficiary of the rising tide in heavily shorted names.

But, this week, many of these short squeeze stocks have plunged.

Not FUBO stock — and that’s because fuboTV is no GameStop or AMC.

## Unlike GameStop, fuboTV Is Fundamentally Strong

FuboTV — unlike many of the other heavily shorted companies that soared last week — is supported by very strong fundamentals and has a long runway for profitable growth ahead.

Here’s the story.

Media consumption is pivoting from linear TV to streaming TV because the latter is cheaper, more flexible, and more convenient. Yet, even though **Netflix** has reached ubiquity among U.S. households, most households still pay for cable TV, because Netflix doesn’t have live sports, live programming or news — three things which Americans still love to watch.

That’s why a new generation of live TV streaming services has emerged over the past decade. These services take live TV content, and package it into a streaming service — somewhat like a “Netflix for TV”. Because demand for live TV is robust and because streaming TV offers significant advantages over linear TV, these live TV streaming services represent the future of TV and will one day be as commonplace in households as cable TV is today.

fuboTV is one of these live TV streaming services. It’s differentiation is that it is a sports-focused live TV streaming platform. That is, the company is hyper-focused on acquiring exclusive sports content and launching a digital sportsbook to enable dynamic sports betting through its live TV streaming platform.

In other words, fuboTV projects as a live TV streaming service purpose-built for sports super-fans and gamblers.

That’s a large audience. About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.

Thus, fuboTV projects as a streaming platform that will one day have tens of millions of paid subscribers. It has just 500,000 paid subs today.

The runway for growth here is very long — and consequently, the potential upside in FUBO stock is very big.

## FuboTV Stock to $200?

My numbers indicate that FUBO stock will soar to $200 over the next several years.

Here are those numbers.

I broadly assume that fuboTV can scale to \~10 million paid subscribers by 2030. I think that average revenue per subscriber per month can grow to about $70, assisted by ad revenue growth and sports betting revenue growth. That implies around $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.

I see EBITDA margins running towards 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.

Assuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030.

Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.

## Bottom Line on FUBO Stock

Not all short squeeze stocks are created equal. On one hand, you have GME stock and AMC stock, who have tons of short squeeze firepower but very weak fundamentals. On the other hand, you have FUBO stock, who has almost as much short-squeeze firepower and strong fundamentals, too.

That’s a powerful combination which should sustain the current uptrend in FUBO stock not just for the next few days — but for the next few years, as well.",2021-02-01 19:21:44

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, shall be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction.""

I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

371,"Stock goes lower, puts go down","I've written a few posts on GME, AMC et al lately and one of the things I've been trying to point out is how risky long premium trades, especially non-spreads are when the parabolic short squeeze is over. (This post uses GME as an example but this applies to all stocks like it)

TL:DR ... Vol gets crushed, even puts, and even puts when the stock is moving lower.

Today is a perfect example. GME was down 100 dollars to $225 and every put from the 285 strike down *lost value.*

It's a little counter-intuitive but hopefully, it will make sense if you consider a few reasons why. Essentially, in a short squeeze the crashes are to the upside and are very difficult for options to price. Short squeeze stock options are priced more like commodities than stocks (commodities crash to the upside). As the stock flies higher implied vol rises, and when the stock reverses and goes lower, implied vol falls.

Here's an interesting comparison. The first chart is the monthly expected move in GME from last week when the stock was $300, pricing in a move of about 90% and a bullish consensus near $570 and bearish near $40: [chart](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-10.28.26-AM.png)

Now here's the expected move based on today's closing prices in options, about 85%, but with the stock much lower, and a bullish consensus just $369, and bearish near $30:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jl4i6nd1x3f61.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e54379e06e8aebd0e176d9090fd636518ebbe78f

Now obviously, 85% of $200 is a lot less than 90% of $300 in dollar terms. And that's a good starting point to understand what happens when these stocks go lower. In both cases, the at-the-money straddle is trying to price the risk of the stock going higher, or back towards zero.

But options can't price the straddle so that it's *below* zero. So as the stock goes lower, that straddle needs to collapse. The risk to market makers (I'm a former market maker) is getting plugged with a bunch of options premium that needs the stock to go *lower than zero* to make money. (Remember, every option bought or sold by market makers is hedged delta neutral, turning it into a synthetic straddle). Believe me, it's painful getting plugged with collapsing vol.

So what happens is vol gets crushed as the stock goes lower. And the more methodically it goes lower, the worse those puts do. (very similar to buying OTM calls, watching a stock creep up towards your strike and realizing you actually lost money despite getting the direction right.)

There are trade types that can help alleviate the pain of collapsing vol and most of them involve trying to sell options, either as outright credit spreads or at least as vertical debit spreads that lay off some of the high vol.

Like a short squeeze, a vol crush does eventually end as well. Ironically it probably involves a bounce in the stock at some point. I made this point in a post last week at [Learn](https://learn.optionsai.com/how-a-short-squeeze-might-end-and-whats-going-on-in-options-with-gamestop-examples/) with some examples like bearish flies or 1x2s, and of course call spreads rather than calls for what is likely to be much more modest squeezes higher if and when those do happen again.",2021-02-01 19:57:43

374,"Canadian regulators eye Reddit rally, vow to act if manipulation identified","Considering how **weak** Canadian regulators are, I think this is more bark than bite but good to keep an eye on this - because they're probably keeping an eye on us as we speak  * *waves to the Canadian Securities Administrators* *

* * *

Canadian securities regulators are keeping a close eye on the impact of the Reddit-fuelled rally in a slate of stocks.

In a joint statement released Monday, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) said they are closely monitoring any extreme price movements in stocks that may be increasing volatility on Canadian markets.

“With strong market oversight and surveillance infrastructure in place, Canadian regulators are working together closely to protect investors while ensuring that the markets operate in an orderly manner and with integrity,” the regulators said in the release. 

“We are monitoring market activity in real-time to support healthy Canadian capital markets and to protect investors. Canada’s capital markets remain strong.”

The CSA and IIROC said they are in close contact with other regulatory bodies both at home and abroad. The statement comes in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announcement Friday that it was launching a review into recent trading activity that sent shares of the likes of BlackBerry Ltd., GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. skyrocketing over the past week.

That rally was in part due to a group of Reddit users going all-in on those stocks, most of which were heavily shorted by institutional investors, exacerbating the wild price movements.

IIROC and the CSA said investors should be wary of information circulated through online message boards, given the at-times Wild West nature of online platforms.

""Online chat rooms are unregulated and may contain information that is inaccurate or inappropriate for some investors. Investors should always check the registration of any person or business trying to sell them an investment or give them investment advice,” they said.

In addition to monitoring the situation, the regulators added they will not hesitate to take “appropriate regulatory action” if they determine abusive or manipulative trading activity is taking place.

While regulators have the power to intervene in capital markets if unruly trading activity threatens the stability of the markets, the CSA and IIROC have been hesitant to bar investors from executing trades or entering short positions. 

In April, the regulators declined to bar investors from initiating short positions in spite of the massive swoon in stocks, declaring that markets were continuing to operate in a “fair and orderly fashion.”

375,My first post! Options trades initiated TODAY 2/1/21,"Long time trader, first time poster, lol. Went on a bit of an options spree today. Would love to get your feedback:

* **$FVRR** bought Feb 19 '21 210c at $20.86 - this is my strongest conviction trade and largest option position right now. Had previously sold Feb and Mar 200p and 210p. *Finally* started turning around today.
* **$AMTX** bought Feb 19 '21 10c for $0.94 - closed at $1.05
* **$EHTH** bought Mar 19 '21 85c for $1.30 - closed down at 0.90 and Feb 19 '21 65c for 1.10 also closed down at 0.90 but this should rebound in short order.
* **$AMC** closed out most of my remaining Feb and Mar 15c and 3.5c respectively for around 1,000% on a small position.
* **$BCRX** rolled a prior position into Mar 19 '21 10c for 2.53 (closed at 3.30), June '21 12c for 2.88 (closed at 3.45), and Sep '21 16c for 2.55 (closed at 3.00).
* **$IRTC** added more to a position I began last week when the stock unexpectedly dropped 40% on medicare reimbursement rates that the company states strongly is merely an administrative error. So far it seems analysts are in general agreement, though some are holding their breath. Today I bought Mar '21 220c for 25.06 (closed at 30.60)
* **$RIOT** believing that $BTC has about bottomed and will be comin' round the mountain soon, I bought some shares and Feb 05 '21 17c for 3.07 (closed at 3.55). Later in the day I added Feb 05 '21 16c for 4.20 (closed at 4.35) and 20.5c for 1.46 (closed at 1.35)
* **$UNIT** discovering it as a high conviction trade from Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" fame--and he was pretty right about $GME in a big way, was he not?--I bought a spread of Aug '21 15c for 1.00 (closed at 0.85) and Jan '22 15c at 1.55 (closed at 1.35) and Jan '22 20c for 0.65 (closed at 0.45).
* **$NNOX** bought May '21 70c at 17.00 (closed at 17.50) and Aug '21 90c at 17.56 (closed at 30.50 - nice!)
* **$FUBO** bought Apr '21 50c at 16.05 (closed at 17.30). This was an add to a prior stock and option position.
* **$RDFN** added to my position here as well. Bought May '21 80c at 9.26 (closed at 9.70) and Aug '21 90c at 9.46 (closed at 10.00).
* **$PCG** based on some unusual call option activity I noticed, I sold some Mar '21 11p and bought several different calls: Mar '21 12c, 14c; and Jun '21 13c, 15, and 17c. Probably spent too much on commissions here. Whatev. I'm learning the best strategies not just through learning and reviewing theory but also by experimenting with actual trades.
* **$GME** \- and this was my revenge trade. I lost a lot of money on this last week, buying shares on the way up then getting stopped out when IBKR halted my ability to do anything but close out. And close out I did at nearly 50% losses. Plus my whole portfolio suffered as brokers, funds and everyone else was liquidating to cover their shorts. In any case, I did a safe trade and a risky trade:

1. Safe: sold Jan '22 25p for 10.00 and 10p for 2.55. Being so far out they haven't moved.. yet.
2. Risky: bought Feb 05 '21 220p for 53.61 (closed at 52.00) and 190p for 38.59 (closed at 36.20).

377,GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next,"Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question. 

**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.

**EDIT3:** Revolut has set AMC and GME to sell only today. I can’t wrap my head around these moves, but the squeeze is over? Not likely...something simply doesn’t add up here

**EDIT4:** Today’s volume already blows away yesterday’s and Fridays giving more merit to my thesis. Trading restrictions still have complete blocks on GME but RH opened the flood gates an hour ago. My God this stock is exhilarating.

**EDIT5 - 02/03 08:17** I know everyone wants an update to my option and I would love to give one. Sadly the transformer in my building has blown and the power is out on my entire side of they building. This means no heat and no electricity. My dog and I are freezing and worse than that I work from home. 

A quick update on my personal opinion, I’m still bullish. Yesterday was expected, I didn’t think it would go under $100 but we figured it would be bloody. Today is very interesting with T+2 definitely being over that means we are starting to get some Failure To Delivers. GameStop getting listed on the [short restriction list ](ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210202.xls) makes things interesting as well. Apparently Warren is also pushing for an emergency meeting, just speculating but it could result in a 30 day trading halt. Moral of the story, I’m still bullish, Im still holding, this is all speculation, anyone who pretends it isn’t speculation is full of shit. You ultimately have to decide.

379,I’m completely sick of seeing GME and AMC posts,"I’m more interested in basically every other stock available on the market at this point. So I really hope to start seeing some DD posts about new companies or existing ones with potentially bright futures. 

I was in amc at 2.41 a week before they took off fully having researched and believing theatres will make a comeback and that that share price was an absolute steal. I was rewarded for this but only by luck, not by AMC themselves. Luckily I’m able to distinguish that and not consider this pure luck as me being some expert investor in my first week of investing

Right now I’m in sundial. It’s a penny, high risk high reward stock. The ceo is making headway toward profitability and that’s really all we can ask for, a ceo who is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed= good odds of success in my eyes. All anyone can do is try, sundial is up today in a good way. Hoping to see more good results tomorrow

Just saying though, like the people constantly bombarding with GME posts are seeing a lot of fucking new income, getting high off it and are now just as fucking greedy as wallstreet folks.. like lol. It was never about taking on the big guys. If it was, it was only like the first few days of it now it’s just greedy.",2021-02-01 23:25:51

381,Stock Market Data Downloader - Python,"Hey Squad! 

With all the chaos in the stock market lately, I thought now would be a good time to share this stock market data downloader I put together. For someone looking to get access to a ton of data quickly, this script can come in handy and hopefully save a bunch of time which otherwise would be wasted trying to get the yahoo-finance pip package working (which I've always had a hard time with.) 

I'm actually still using the yahoo-finance URL to download historical market data directly for any number of tickers you choose, just in a more direct manner. I've struggled countless times over the years with getting yahoo-finance to cooperate with me, and have finally seems to land on a good solution here. For someone looking for quick and dirty access to data - this script could be your answer! 

**The steps to getting the script running are as follows:** 

* Clone my GitHub repository: [https://github.com/melo-gonzo/StockDataDownload](https://github.com/melo-gonzo/StockDataDownload)
* Install dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Set up a default list of tickers. This can be a blank text file, or a list of tickers each on their own new line saved as a text file. For example: /home/user/Desktop/tickers.txt
* Set up a directory to save csv files to. For example: /home/user/Desktop/CSVFiles
* Optionally, change the default ticker\_location and csv\_location file paths in the script itself.
* Run the script download\_data.py from the command line, or your favorite IDE.

**Examples:**

* Download data using a pre-saved list of tickers
   * `python download_data.py --ticker_location /home/user/Desktop/tickers.txt --csv_location /home/user/Desktop/CSVFiles/`
* Download data using a string of tickers without referencing a tickers.txt file
   * `python download_data.py --csv_location /home/user/Desktop/CSVFiles/ --add_tickers ""GME,AMC,AAPL,TSLA,SPY""`

Once you run the script, you'll find csv files in the specified csv\_location folder containing data for as far back as yahoo finance can see. When or if you run the script again on another day, only the newest data will be pulled down and automatically appended to the existing csv files, if they exist. If there is no csv file to append to, the full history will be re-downloaded.

Let me know if you run into any issues and I'd be happy to help get you up to speed and downloading data to your hearts content.

Best,

=========================================

Funko is a good company with solid performance that is still trading at a reasonable price.

Check out my DD below:

[Funko](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumers-indulged-in-funko-pop-figurines-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-213521995.html) (FNKO)

Share Price (02/01/21) : $12.90

Share Price (09/16/19) : $27.86

Short Interest (1/26/21) : 14%

Next Earnings Release: March 11th, 2021

[Funko Inc.](https://www.funko.com/) is an American company that manufactures licensed pop culture collectibles, best known for its licensed vinyl figurines and bobbleheads. They have over 1,000 licenses across music, video games, film, TV, sports and many other pop culture properties. Some of their most popular licensed brands include Marvel, Disney, Star Wars, Pokemon, Fortnite, NBA, NFL, MLB, DC Comics, and a variety of anime properties.

Several points below support the belief that Funko’s revenue grew during the 2020 holiday season and could continue well into 2021:

· Increasing search traffic for Funko products

· Direct sales growth is driving increased revenue and profitability

· Parents are buying more gifts for their kids due to COVID

· People have more disposable income from staying at home and not going out

· Expansion of new products and licensees continuing through 2021

· Collectible investments like Funko POP! figures are exploding in value and popularity

· Recent analyst commentary, valuation, and financials are positive

**FUNKO’S SEARCH TRAFFIC REACHES AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN Q4 2020**

“Funko” google trends search traffic was up 20-30% in Q4 2020 (vs. Q4 2019)

Searches for “Funko” were up 2x in December vs the beginning of November 2020

After falling in December, “Funko” searches are trending back up to all-time-high levels

**FUNKO’S DIRECT SALES INITIATIVES DRIVING HIGHER REVENUE & MARGIN**

Funko Direct Sales (B2C) grew significantly in Q3 and likely to continue into Q4

· B2C business as a percentage of sales increased to 8% in Q3 2020 from 4% during the prior year.

· Funko’s e-commerce site grew over 150% vs. the prior year in Q3 2020

· The number of SKU’s on Funko’s e-commerce site rose tenfold since June 2020

*“We went from only 200 of our own products \[on our website\] as late as June this year, to now well over 2,000 products available on our website.” – Funko CEO, Brian Mariotti*

Funko’s first ever Selena Pop! sold out online in just 40 minutes.

Funko’s Q3 2020 Gross Profit % and Operating Margin % were near all-time-highs for the company

· Funko’s Q3 Gross Profit Percentage of 38.6% was its second highest ever (behind only Q1 2020)

· Funko’s Q3 Operating Profit Percentage of 10.8% was its second highest ever (behind only Q4 2018)

· As Funko continues to grow it’s B2C e-commerce sales in Q4 and beyond, it is possible that gross profit and operating profit percentages could rise as well

Retail customers were able to shift their Brick & Mortar inventory to their e-commerce channels to Funko unit sales

· Funko resellers who didn’t sell online were severely impacted by Brick & Mortar closures during COVID stay-at-home orders. As 2020 progressed, some of these retailers were able to create online stores (e.g.- Shopify, Amazon, eBay, etc.) through which they could sell their Funko inventory.

· Larger retailers that already had an omni-channel presence were able to shift their sales inventory from their Brick & Mortar stores to online fulfilment.

Funko has also created a mini-Pop! factory at its headquarters where customers can make their own custom Funko at a price of $25 each

· According to Funko, you can customize your Pop! using thousands of combinations. It’s “Think Build-A-Bear meets Funko Pop!” according to CEO Brian Mariotti.

· With a $25 price point, the margins are likely higher than the average Pop! figure that retails for between $10 to $15

**PARENTS BUYING MORE GIFTS FOR THEIR KIDS DUE TO COVID**

Parents likely splurged on their kids out of guilt of having shelter at home because of restrictions and to keep them occupied while they had to work at home.

· “Faced with rising transmission of the virus, state restrictions on retailers and heightened political and economic uncertainty, consumers chose to spend on gifts that lifted the spirits of their families and friends and provided a sense of normalcy given the challenging year. We believe President-elect Biden’s stimulus proposal, with direct payments to families and individuals, and further aid for small businesses and tools to keep businesses open, will keep the economy growing.” NRF President Matthew Shay

· “2020 was an unprecedented year for the U.S. toy industry. The growth we’ve seen in the toy industry speaks to the fact that parents are willing to put their children’s happiness above all else. The industry’s resiliency is very much underpinned by the reality that, in times of hardship, families look to toys to help keep their children engaged, active, and delighted. Put simply, toys are a big part of the happiness equation.” Juli Lennett - VP, U.S. Toys at NPD

Toy sales were strong in 2020 as US retail sales of toys was up 16% vs 2019; driven by pandemic spending

· According to NPD, “Much of the growth in 2020 was directly correlated to the COVID-19 pandemic and the changing consumer behavior associated with widespread lockdowns and school closures, the disposable income diverted from other types of entertainment to toys, as well as the onset of federal stimulus checks.”

Consumer spending on toys increased measurably due to lockdowns; with strong performance continuing through the holidays

· Per NPD, “While toy sales through mid-March 2020 were flat vs. 2019, widespread lockdown measures led to an abrupt increase in sales. This was further amplified by the distribution of stimulus checks beginning in April, resulting in the strongest month of growth for the year in May (+38%). Toy industry growth peaked again in October with an increase of 33% when the holiday season kicked off with Amazon Prime Day along with other retailer deals the same week.”

Key retail sources reporting significant sales growth during Q4 2020 suggest Funko sales performance was strong

· Target Q4 sales were fantastic showing signs of retail strength with a consumer that overlaps well with the Funko

\> Overall comparable sales were up 17.2%

\> Comparable digital sales were up over 100%

\> Store-originated comparable sales were up 4.2%

\> Store traffic was up 4.3%

\> Average ticket size was up 12.3%

· GameStop Q4 sales were solid; showing additional potential for Funko sales

\> Same store sales were up 4.8% in Q4 2020

\> Online sales increased 309% in Q4 2020

· According to the NRF, 2020 Holiday Retail Sales were up 8.3% compared to the prior year despite the pandemic

\> A surge in online shopping drove the increase (rising 32% vs. 2019)

\> The increase of 8.3% was over double the average increase of 3.5% that the industry had seen over the last five years.

**MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME TO SPEND AT HOME BY NOT GOING OUT**

The National Retail Federation (NRF) says that strong retail performance has been driven by consumers with stimulus checks and extra savings from not going out or traveling

· “There was a massive boost to consumer wallets this season. Consumers were able to splurge on holiday gifts because of increased money in their bank accounts from the stimulus payments they received earlier in the year and the money they saved by not traveling, dining out, or attending entertainment events” – NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz.

Spending on “experiences” fell significantly in 2020

· The US Travel Association forecasts that spending on travel fell $500 billion in 2020 from $1.1 trillion in 2019

\> The industry has lost about 40% of its direct travel jobs (about 3.5 million jobs) in 2020; driven by a reduction in business travel

\> Foreign visitors to the US fell about 75% in 2020; driving a $119 billion reduction in travel spending

· Concert spending is down dramatically

\> Live Nation reported a 98% decline in concert revenue in Q2 2020 and a 95% decline in concert revenue in Q3 2020

\> About 5.2 million tickets were refunded in Q3 2020 and 23.3 million tickets had been refunded so far in 2020 (as of the end of Q3)

· Movie theater attendance is down substantially

\> AMC theaters saw a 97% decline in attendance and a 91% decline in revenue in Q3 2020

\> Cinemark saw a 96% decline in revenue

\> Marcus Corporation (which also owns hotels and restaurants) saw a 84% decline in revenue

\> Studio Movie Grill filed for bankruptcy

· Other anecdotal information points to more stay-at-home activity decreasing recreational spending

\> Chuck E Cheese’s declared bankruptcy

\> Dave & Busters is considering bankruptcy and plans layoffs of +1,000

\> CiCi’s Pizza declares bankruptcy

\> Starbucks saw fewer customers, reduced store hours, increased store closures, and a 5% decline in revenues in Q4 2020. This has led them to plan a shift to more “to-go” formats

\> Many Las Vegas Hotels and Casinos have decided to close “part-time” during the week due to lower attendance and travel.

These include Encore, Rio, Linq, Planet Hollywood, Mandalay Bay, Park MGM, and Mirage

The majority of food buffets at the major hotels and casinos have been shuttered for the time being

Stimulus checks and other government programs to support consumer spending provide tailwinds for retail activity

· The US government authorized more than $10,000 per person in stimulus spending in 2020 over the course of five relief bills totaling $3.5 trillion

· More stimulus spending is expected; including a potential $1.9 trillion package that could include an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks

**MORE SKUS / LICENSES ARE GROWING AND EXPECTED TO CONINUE STRONG**

Active properties continue to rise and are expected to grow well into the future

· The number of active properties in Q3 2020 grew 15% over 2019

· Active properties grew from 644 in Q2 to 715 in Q3 2020

· The potential universe for Funko Pops! is limitless as new films, tv shows, musicians, anime characters, sports stars, and other media properties are created every year.

Some of the hot properties for this year and beyond

· Star Wars: Baby Yoda, Mandalorian, Rey, Valentine’s Day, etc.

· Marvel: WandaVision, Deadpool, Lucha Libre, Spiderman, Venom

· Anime: Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Bakugan, My Hero Academia

· Films: Harry Potter, The Goonies, The Mummy, Fast & Furious

· TV: The Office, Umbrella Academy, The Queen’s Gambit, The Simpsons

· Sports: NFL, NBA, MLB, WWE

· Others: Disney, Pokemon, etc.

Retail exclusives can grow the potential universe of licenses and increase retailer buy-in

· For example: A retailer like GameStop could lobby Funko to make a GameStop exclusive of the WallStreetBets Kid like this person suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/l8wdqd/request_a_wallstreetbets_kid_funko_pop_i_think_if/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). (The exclusive Pop! would be made into a limited edition and sold only to GameStop to sell at their stores)

**COLLECTIBLE INVESTMENTS ARE GROWING IN VALUE & POPULARITY**

· Funko: The average Pops! Figure has a retail price from between $10 and $15 which allows most people an affordable entry point into collecting. Over time some Pops! Figures increase substantially in price; from $50 to $100 to even several thousand dollars. While some collectors buy Pops! as primarily an investment, many more buy them as a way to show their fandom. Whether they are avid Star Wars, Harry Potter, Pokemon, Sports, or Anime fans; collectors build large collections and show them off to friends.

· Sports Cards: To those paying attention, sports cards have been on a massive run with some cards worth more than your parent’s house and your sister’s car. Since the pandemic started, the demand for sports collectibles from basketball to football to soccer (and many others) has skyrocketed. Countless videos of box-breaks and pack openings have become the norm on social media. Some of these boxes are being purchased for tens of thousands with “hits” ranging from several hundred to hundreds of thousands.

· Collector’s Universe: This company that grades sports cards and other collectibles has tripled in value since June 2020. The number of sports collectors grading cards has exploded as demand rises. The popularity of grading sports cards is expected to maintain as prices continue to rise and the hobby becomes more mainstream.

**ANALYST COMMENTARY AND FINANCIALS ARE A POSTIVE FOR THE STOCK**

Piper Sandler: Upgraded Funko from “Neutral” to “Overweight” (raising their price target from $6 to $12).

· Analyst Erin Murphy sees evidence of “subsequent revenue pillars” with their recent launch of Snapsies at 800 Target stores; along with an expansion into board games and its digital efforts, which include a newly launched website in six European countries.

Valuation Comparison: Market Cap / Revenue (TTM)

· Funko: MC - $604 million / Rev - $640 million (0.9x sales)

· Mattel: MC - $6.27 billion / Rev - $4.43 billion (1.4x sales)

· Hasbro: MC - $13.13 billion / Rev - $5.17 billion (2.5x sales)

Key Financial Trends For Funko

· Q3 2020 EPS (Adjusted) = $0.31

\> Third highest ever (only Q4 2018 & Q3 2019 were higher)

· Q3 2020 Revenue = $191 million

\> Fourth highest ever (only Q4 2018, Q3 2019, and Q4 2019 were higher)

· Q3 2020 Revenue increase vs prior quarter of 94%

\> Q1 and Q2 2020 saw significant declines due to COVID

\> Q3 2020 only down 14% vs Q3 2019 despite Q2 2020 being down 49%

\> Q3 2020 strength driven by Funko adapting quickly to online in the US market. (Q4 2020 revenue growth could be aided substantially by Funko’s development of their e-commerce shop in Europe.)

· Q3 2020 SG&A was reduced 20% vs. the prior year as Funko rationalizes costs and adjusts to focus more on D2C e-commerce

**TL;DR**

After a tough summer, Funko sales have rocketed back in Q3 to near where they were pre-pandemic; setting up a potentially historic earnings for Q4 2020. Google search activity suggests that Funko is as popular as ever and is set up well for a strong year in 2021. People are spending less on “going out;” instead buying things to use at home and presents for their kids. As time passes, Funko’s status as a popular collectible only continues to gain momentum.

Their direct sales initiative allows Funko to capture additional margin by sidestepping traditional brick and mortar retail to reach their customers. Investments in collectible products like Pops! and sports cards continue to increase in popularity and price. And the company continues to release even more products beyond Pops!; including games and apparel. While some Wall Street Analysts have already begun to take notice, a strong Q4 earnings announcement can drive even more attention to the stock.

384,Just bought yesterday my first AMC stocks and bought today another 20! Germany stays strong! To the moon 💎 🙌 🚀,,2021-02-02 06:14:05
385,Current situation with AMC?,"Let me start by saying r/stocks seems a lot more civilized than WSB - I feel like i'll get an informed answer here.

I'll be honest and admit yesterday i got rather excited around the AMC hype and bought 50 shares at 13.50.

Pre-market is looking fairly bleak however with the constant talk of 'ladder attacks' and the short squeeze, should i be feeling fairly confident? As well as this people keep saying that the shorts have to cover by Thursday, is there any actual documentation that proves this, or this is just speculation?

I knew that the investment wasn't an overnight thing and was always happy to play the long-term game.

Again I have to admit that I am a novice and would love an informed insight into the current climate of AMC, is this just the beginning, or has the ship already sailed?

TIA x

&#x200B;

EDIT: I can't see your comments, how do i fix that?",2021-02-02 08:11:27
386,AMC stock probably would have been worth it even if all of this wasn't happening,"okay take all of this with a grain of salt cause it has tons of speculation and I'm also completely clueless and too ignorant to know whether or not anyone's said anything about this

If any of you cutie pies weren't busy eating crayons and looking at your bedroom wall whilst trying to comprehend the deeper meanings of life, you'd probably have an actual job. The irony here is that I'm going to go about my career in movie production(I know it's not an actual job don't mock me) and what's been going on there for the past few years after Netflix started their expansion. [This](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bOTyoAE6VrRCAZ5GEOg3J?si=Vw4NHRN_TFSsXnCVcleURg) is a really good podcast episode , which I'll TLDR for you cause you retards can't keep your peanut-sized brains concentrated for more than 3 minutes:

Netflix and Amazon have only been gaining profits since covid came to the west and their counterparts - the movie theaters have only been suffering losses. As with any business this creates enormous leverage for both of these companies to  buy off an entire franchise in order to completely monopolize the market.( I don't mean to judge, this is just natural). I guess you could argue that streaming is way more convenient, but if you were to actually read up on that Google Scholar research you'd realize this is not the case for the community and 🦍 just want to look at big screens. The platforms just need more places to display their prepaid Hollywood star-packed productions so that they can earn that sweet sweet money, because you'll all go watch that movie, because of that hot actor/actress (that's right I don't discriminate). And even if that isn't the case(highly doubt it), you'd still watch it because it's Netflix. It's only but natural for them to want to want to buy stocks of movie theaters at a discounted price. Does this remind you of something you should be doing right now? 

All in all this is just some industry insight argumentation that only supports not selling anything be it GME(which hasn't shifted to online only because chairmen didn't want to have to fight with Mr. Bald Headed Smeagle Jeff Bezos(we wouldn't have been in the position we were today if it had)) or AMC, but don't follow it as financial advice, because I, like you, am retarded too.",2021-02-02 08:35:48
387,"A Must-Read for New Traders/Investors - BlackBerry, AMC, and others","I feel compelled to write this post because I am seeing it first hand right now. People everywhere are asking whether GameStop or AMC or Blackberry or even Silver are good buys. Why? Because they are ALL in the news, embedded in culture at this very moment. They are being texted and shared with friends and discussed across the Internet. **I want to write about this to shed light on a really interesting concept in markets related to this and I hope it helps someone.**

First of all, there's an old trader rule that says *""if a stock makes the news, you're late.""* What that means is someone who was more prepared, who had built a long-term plan, was involved before the news became a thing. Before you knew what it was. It's important to remember that people do this for a living -  studying companies, writing about them, reading about them, and building a position over time before the news cycle begins. You need to know this to make better decisions. Otherwise you will chase news headlines and continue to be *""late.""* Now of course, some people do chase headlines for a living, buying on big news announcements, but just remember that someone out there was there long before it happened. The awareness of this will really change your perspective on markets.

The next topic I want to shed some light on is the broad market and all of the ideas available to you if you just look around. **I see WAY TOO many people talking about AMC and Blackberry and others.** There are 3000+ other stocks in the market. That's right... 3000. Add in crypto and that's easily another 1000+ crypto projects. Add in forex and futures and that's easily another 500+ futures and forex trades. The point I am trying to make is - REALLY? You're going to buy AMC or Blackberry just because you saw a headline? There are 5000+ other trades and ideas out there. Take your time. Be patient. Don't chase. Look at the entire market. It's wide open to you.

The final point of this post is the idea that the market is not going anywhere. **Avoid FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) at all costs. My good friend tells me to embrace JOMO (Joy of Missing Out).** The point here, and concluding paragraph, is that the market has been open for 100+ years. It is not going anywhere. No one is telling you to buy or sell. You are talking to yourself and spiraling into a whirlwind of FOMO. You have to take ownership of your portfolio. There is no manipulation or scam going on other than your decision making. The same way you research a car or TV, hours of research, reading reviews, studying your budget, is the same way you should approach markets. There is no rush to do anything. You won't ""miss the move."" As I said, the market has been open 100+ years. Relax. JOMO is a great strategy in certain times.

I hope this post helps and I wrote it because you all mean a lot to me. I have been online talking markets since 2010. I am thankful to the Internet, Reddit, and even Twitter because of the doors they've opened in my life. Especially around markets. So I really write this post to help someone, anyone, who is new or confused about the markets. I also want to say that I write this having done all the above. No joke. I have done ALL of the above and been hosed so many times. So I hope this helps.

Thanks for reading and good luck!",2021-02-02 08:54:30

397,Revolut (DriveWealth) is restricting buying of GME and AMC from 02/02/21. Read the email i just received below. They are essentially doing what Robinhood did last week.,"“Trading Update for GME & AMC
Hi,

From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.

What does this mean for me?
You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.

None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.

For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.

Why is this happening?
When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.

The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.

This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.

When will they be available again to buy?
This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

**Capital at Risk**

404,AMC Profit Opportunity - Comparing CSP vs PCS,"Will AMC moon? The short squeeze is coming, right? RIGHT? 

Sorry, no crystal ball can give you that answer. But in the meantime, there's definitely opportunity in making a quick buck (literally) in the massive volatility in AMC, or any other BANG stocks for that matter.

Decided to jump at an opportunity to collect some juicy option premiums in AMC this morning, as the **IV30 Rank was at 97%**: 

Here's a quick comparison between the oft mentioned options strategies:

**Cash Secured Put (CSP)** 

* Contract: $4 Put expiring Feb 5
* Collateral per contract: 4 x 100 = $400
* Premium collected: 0.18 x 100 = $18
* % Return by Feb 5 if AMC stays above $4 = 18 / 400 =  **4.50%**

**Put Credit Spread (PCS)** 

* Contracts: $2 and $4 Puts expiring Feb 5
* Collateral per spread: (4 - 2 - 0.15) x 100 = $185
* Premium collected: 0.15 x 100 = $15
* % Return by Feb 5 if AMC stays above $4: 15 / 185 = **8.11%**

Prices are as of 12:15pm EST today, when AMC was \~$8. Bid-Ask on $2 was 0.02/0.03, on $4 was 0.18/0.19.

The reason this trade was executed is purely for the following reasons:

* There's residual value left in AMC for the post-COVID recovery. Whatever that number is, it's certainly not less than $4/share right now. PM me to argue lol. 
* Restrictions by a number of brokerages are still in place to BUY shares and options in AMC, suppressing demand. Once uncorked, pricing should balance out better (arguably towards the upside). 

Anyone with a better less than 5 DTE strategy on AMC, please share! Would definitely like some opinions and recommendations.  

Will also definitely be back here after market closes this Friday to update how this trade goes.

405,CGX.TO for the long,"Obviously AMC has shown it’s tremendous upswing with US market removing restrictions and it being a “meme” stock is irrelevant. I bought at 2.88 several weeks back because the writing was on the wall with how vaccinations were increasing in the states.  Now let’s look at the Canadian counterpart. 

Cineplex is the biggest theatre player in Canada by far. Clearly the pandemic has caused issues with the company and they have also made irrational choices with their services (ie. playcentres), however I do strongly think that this stock will rebound in the future (long) once vaccinations reach their target for life to reopen. 

Now I’m not saying this is a get rich overnight stock option however I do believe with it hovering around 10 CDN per share since this pandemic started shows that recovery is in the cards.

413,AMC Straddle Play - March 5th,"Huge opportunity with AMC straddles- March 5th expiration, 7$ strike, 244/305. Implied volatility and relationship to GME make AMC a bargain straddle play. 

Put value: Trading pre-GME sub-3$. While bankruptcy is out of the question, additional stock sales are not. I see this as the major AMC downside argument. 

Call value: While AMC is unlikely to reach peak-GME levels again (20$+), a push to 12-14$ is well within the realm of possibility. AMC is also now set up with a 6$ floor, I see big upside here. 

*Additional Play* Buy AMC sub-6$, sell weekly far-out-of-the-money calls. 

Summary, AMC options are incredibly undervalued right now. Great upside play with limited risk.

Edit: Additional comments. 1. 5% underlying asset move is just my general rule of thumb. It can vary depending on situation. 2. Straddles are a good strategy when the contracts are bargain-priced. If you tried a straddle on AMC when it was trading at 15+ it would be 10x harder to exit because of the volatility premium you paid.",2021-02-02 18:06:22
414,"if you lost a ton of money playing the meme stocks, consider it as tuition","Starting to see people getting regretful and depressed over losing a ton of money or giving up profits when they were up on these meme stocks. If you're serious about trading you would use this experience to learn from it and develop as a trader. We never want to trade what we want to see, we trade what we do see. There are a ton of ways to manage winners, but the best way is to just to just set targets, lock in a %, and set a stop for the rest above your entry.

If you are ever in the future up on a position by a substantial amount, take some off the table. By locking in 70-80% of your positions, you 1) reduce risk, and 2) lock in realized gains. Until you sell, they are purely just numbers on the screen. 

If you purely just bought these things with no plan in mind and expected the moon, you are gambling, not trading. You must figure this out before you take this trade. 

A story I have for people here is that a friend of mine bought into GME, AMC, NOK, BB all because of the hype. The first 2 days he was up a nice chunk of money, but as the brokerages began setting limits and buying pressure began fading, his positions quickly turned red. I asked him about his stop loss and he said he doesn't have one or even knows what that is. Currently he is down $50,000, roughly 70% of his account is gone. In the end, he gambled, didn't see himself losing, and now he lost almost everything.",2021-02-02 19:22:38
415,Story on how you made a fund 113 million dollars richer,"There is this fund called Silver Lake Partners, which was holding AMC convertible debt. Well, it’s not actually a fund, more like a PE firm. Anyway.

Convertible bonds are essentially like normal bonds, except they can converted to stock after the stock reaches a conversion price which is specified in the bond agreement. Essentially, I own 1 bond for 1000 dollars, and if the price reaches 10 dollars per share, I can convert the bond into shares and just dip (sell or hold). Sounds fairly easy, right?


Well, Silver Lake Partners was holding these bonds, probably super depressed knowing that they will be pretty much worthless if AMC goes bankrupt. However, here is where WSB apes come in play. They spike the price so much that the conversion price specified on the bonds is actually reached. Silver Lake can not believe their fucking luck, they convert the bonds into shares and dump it last week at the heigh of the bubble, selling shares for 713 million dollars, and making a profit of 113 million. 
This also triggers a share dilution which eases the chances of any potential short squeeze, and lowers a potential future price per share.

Moral of the story?
These people from San Francisco just got way richer and dumped their bags on retail investors. This is why it is bad to trade on emotions, you will inevitably help some of these people you hate, and be left holding the bag.

416,Why You Should Get Into Long Positions of Cannabis,"This is not a post about GME...Or DOGE...Or AMC

This is my opinion on one of top growth plays of 2021

Cannabis will be one of the top performing markets in 2021 for many reasons:

1) Mexico is set to legalize recreational marijuana this year, becoming the largest country (\~128 million people) in the world to do so. [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSE1N2BP014](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSE1N2BP014)

2) The US voted to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona (7.3 million), Montana (1 million), and New Jersey (\~8.9 million) [https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/04/politics/marijuana-legalization-2020-states/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/04/politics/marijuana-legalization-2020-states/index.html)

3) The US is pushing legislation, (with a Democratic majority in house and senate) to fully decriminalize marijuana in the entire US). there's currently 15 states that still don't allow even medical marijuana...so this is huge.  [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/cannabis-reform-senators-say-they-will-push-pot-bill-in-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/cannabis-reform-senators-say-they-will-push-pot-bill-in-2021.html)

4) Dispensaries are quite profitable, which means more of them will continue to open to serve these markets (will get bogged down by permits, but once things are legalized, the permitting is easy enough). More demand, more need to service the demand, thus more supply from our Cannabis companies.

&#x200B;

So who to invest in?

That's a good question because not all companies are created equally. Some are dumpster fires, and others have incredible growth potential. Here are my recommendations based on their fundamentals and their long term growth potential in the North American continent. Outside companies cannot officially come into the US market until it's legal on a federal level. But once that happens (likely in 2021), look no further than our friends in Canada (a.k.a America's Hat)

APHA  - Canada's top producer, grew 74.4% last year. Merging with TLRY to for the largest marijuana company in the world (by revenue).

CGC - Also Canadian, they are ready to also enter the US market, and have gotten some significant investments ($4 billion) from Constellation Brands (STZ), the parent company of Corona beer. They have some issues with profitability, but they have invested heavily in expansion.

GWPH  - UK based, these guys are using CBD in novel pharma drugs. They are pretty good at losing money, but they seem to be turning things around lately.  Revenues grew 51% year over year. Decent investment outside of just the growers

I am not a financial advisor, and I don't think I'm qualified to give financial advice. I wanted to give you some insights into what I think will be the Long play of 2021. Do your research and let me know what you think

EDIT:
 I wanted to add a few more to the list that also have some great potential. I haven't looked into these in detail, but a quick cursory glance shows they are good to keep an eye on.

$HEXO working with Coors, the banquet beer

$GRWG - hydroponics, machinery for growing and harvesting

$SMG - fertilizer and shit, literally

$MSOS - US based ETF for cannabis and hemp

$SNDL- canadian grower. Can make this a pure options play based on current interest in this stock from WSB

**06:40**  //  *Important Gamestop Talk*

We got to talk a little bit about GameStop here. My thoughts on this stock were that it could go up to $600, but it simply didn't happen. I talk about risk management when trading these meme stocks and how it's important to be more careful than normal when you're trading these extremely volatile stocks. A lot of people lost money when they didn't have to, but I'm happy with my $700 profits between AMC and GME last week.

&#x200B;

**14:35**  //  *General Market Overview*

For the stock market, I was bearish last week as the S&P 500 finished down on the week. But now, with talks of stimulus money, I am bullish again on SPY until it hits 390. My analysis still remains the same that its always been, in that I expect a drop to 350 once spy hits 390.

&#x200B;

**16:55**  //  *My Current Positions*

 In this section, we talked about my current positions. I am holding AMTX, TEDU, and TMBR. All of these stocks look great for various reasons, and I expect further bullish movement on all three. Just a reminder that AMTX still hasn't released PR about selling hand sanitizer on Amazon, and it should be able to ship starting February 13th (i think, cant remember the date from the screenshot, either the 13th or the 22nd)

&#x200B;

**33:15**  //  *CRSR*

Not a pennystock. But geez does this company look good. Currently in a triangle pattern waiting to break out. I would honestly be cool with YOLOing all my money into this one at these prices. SIR\_JACKS\_A\_LOT on reddit yolo'ed with $1.7mil at $37.17 a share..

Check this part out if you want to see my indicator that labels ALL candle formations on the chart. It's honestly dope. Bullish haramis, Dojis, Long Upper Shadows, I love it. The stock looks good though. Cant' really see any patterns forming, but overall its a bullish trend.

**41:20**  //  *TMDI*

 current spot that tmdi is in looks great for a buying opportunity. Good price action, solid price structure, great potential. 5:1 risk-reward ratio on this Trade. Stop last $2.41, take profit $3.85

418,Finding my investment compass again after being sucked into WSB,"With all of the GME/AMC craze over at WSB, I got kind of sucked into it.  They're a crazy and funny bunch, but after spending some time there, my investment compass started spinning and I started to seriously question my sanity.  It's like going to a wild party, coming home and then waking up with a huge headache in the morning, not knowing what the hell happened last night.  I needed to remind myself about various investment theses and I am looking to rebalance.  I thought I would share these thoughts in case it might help someone else as much as it helped me to put all my thoughts down on.

20% - Canadian REITs.  These got hit hard in March 2020 and their share price have not recovered much even though many of the larger REITs have good balance sheets, cash flows and rent collection.  They are still massively undervalued, given that everyone is going out and buying houses and over bidding by 100k+, driving up the price of real estate in many major cities.  The Canadian government wants to boost immigration, which is bullish for real estate.  It's a nice time to jump in and hold for the long term.  I don't use ETFs here since I have spent a lot of time analyzing many Canadian REITs.  My favourites are HR.UN, IIP.UN, KMP.UN, SRU.UN, SOT.UN.

20% - ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK).  Cathie Wood's investment thesis is all about investing in disruptive innovation.  Through her team's open research, they actively try to find companies of the future (before they become big) to invest in.  I came to the game way too late (around December 2020). I admit I was skeptical about ARK.  But after listening to Cathie's interviews and videos, I started to gain a lot of respect for her investment intellect and knowledge in the space. I also feel confident ARK is also watching & assessing the macroeconomics side of things and how it affects the companies in their portfolio's and allocating appropriately, as best as they can, which is worth paying the higher price for this ETF.  For now, I would only stick money into ARKK and none of the other more specialized ones.  I think ARK could do well in the next few years, but I am uncertain they will keep doing well in the very long term (decades).

30% - US Total Market (e.g. VUN, XUU).  Jack Bogle's thesis about being in everything and being diversified in your investments.  The US total market ETFs hold over 3000 companies of all sizes and diversified in many sectors and types of businesses.  If you look at the charts, the share price of this index has been rising since the US federal reserve started their QE program.  They are obviously still doing it after the crash in March 2020, creating a huge amount of new money, and that is part of the reason why the US stock market has been going up fast.  The US dollar is the reserve currency.  The US economy is large and everyone is linked to it.  Basically, it's diverse, ""too big to fail"", and has the backing of the fed & reserve currency.  The fed will keep jumping in to prop it up (e.g. Great Recession, COVID pandemic) since retirees and pension funds can't be compromised too much by this index taking decades to recover.  With their embrace of MMT (whether right or wrong), I don't see this dovish stance changing anytime soon.  Why wouldn't you want to invest in this rather safe basket of equities?

10% - High risk & semi-gambling.  I think it's good to allocate a small portion to more high risk type of investments that don't have much correlation with the main index.  These could be precious metals, miners, crytocurrency, YOLO/momentum stocks (shrooms, cannabis, DOC.V, NUMI, AMC, GME, etc.) at no more than 2%, emerging market stocks/etfs.

20% - Cash. You always want to have some dry powder lying around in case of a massive black swan crash, or dips.  The distributions from REITs can help replenish this reserve every month.  I think it would also help stabilize the portfolio a bit more.

Currently, I have no allocation to bonds.  I am also not close to retirement (still have 25 to 30 years)  Interest rates are low everywhere so I don't think bonds are worth it for now.

I am also a bit skeptical about investing in the Canadian market because there is a lot of oil & gas and financials.  I get that oil isn't going away soon (heck they might even do extremely well once the pandemic is over and people want to travel), but wonder if institutional investors will start to move away from such stocks sooner than we think (market being forward looking).  I get that the big Canadian banks are too big to fail, but I think many of them are behind the times (resting on their laurels & not treating customers right since I don't know anyone who actually loves their big bank)... Interest rates are also very low so they're not making much from lending.",2021-02-02 23:54:53

420,Does it make sense to move my position in GME into AMC instead?,"So I have 20 shares of GME @170, and 25 shares of AMC @14.6.

After this release about Black Rock holdings, and the addition of AMC on the SSR list, I believe tomorrow will be a good day for the stock. However, I've been seeing a few graphs showing that the dips between AMC and GME correspond nearly exactly, due to coordination short ladder attacks.

Does it make sense to pull out of my GME position for a larger position in AMC with the SSR and Black Rock news? Or will AMC and GME trends probably stay closely tied together? I'm also hesitant to make the switch because of my monkey 💎✋. Would selling my 20 shares of GME to buy AMC hurt the movement, if I plan on using the returns from a potential AMC upswing to reinvest in GME?

I understand that no one here is a financial advisor, just looking for opinions on whether GME and AMC will remain linked, and possibly opinions on if you think this news supports the probability of an AMC squeeze?",2021-02-03 03:08:17
421,Someone Always Ends Up Holding the “Doo Bag”,"So a lot of folks have been posting about how they got caught up in—and subsequently lost money from—the GME/AMC train that was barreling through the stock market last week and the week before. 

I’ve read many posts across multiple subreddits about people who put in A LOT of cash into these trains hoping to hit the jackpot. I also saw many people admit that they put in money that they could not afford to lose.

To the people who are worried or freaking out about the unrealized losses that they have and the GME/AMC stocks that they’ve been left to hold, chin up. This should be taken as a learning experience and definitely set guidelines for yourselves in case something like this comes along in the future.

Before putting your money into any stock/company as a gamble or investment, please always keep the following in mind:

1) Invest only what you’re willing to lose.
2) Always do your due diligence and read up before you use your money on anything.
3) Don’t let your emotions control your decisions.
4) View hype trains with a little bit more skepticism.

I think what you have going for you right now—which kind of is going against you at the same time—is that nobody can and will ever be able to predict exactly what’s going to happen to GME and AMC. Hopefully, whatever happens ends up being favourable to you all. Good luck!",2021-02-03 05:09:05
422,REZZF/GBML Lithium mine play with extremely low market cap ($14.59M),"So, we're all pretty rundown with all this GME and AMC stuff atm. But its time to kickback and get back into something we can all get behind. Sweet Sweet lithium. 

The DD:
Lithium exploration company with sites based in Lenister (Ireland). project area covers 477.39 km2. On January 21, 2021, the company was given permission by its board of directors to start drilling. 

Initial surveys of the site concluded lithium stream sediment recorded mostly in the 125-1000ppm range vs the 60-120ppm range for other nearby mines (China's Avalonia project also located in ireland)

This area of land is very geopolitically stable and does not suffer the same turmoil and problems as similar land located in Africa and South America.

Additionally, the company is looking to sell a mining plot. Through Minas Dixon, GBML’s/REZZF 55% owned Peruvian subsidiary has granted Minsur the option to acquire a 1800 hectare property (Lara), A copper mine in Peru.

Financials:  
Has had a modest recent run up (30% yesterday) but due to a public offering that dropped the stock price  (Jan 25th) i believe this has a long way to go.

The market cap only sits at ($14.59M), a tiny price cap if you consider some other lithium plays (KODAL for example has a market cap on 1Bn and has also yet to produce any lithium).

Good assets to liabilities of 40.3% 

I could see this stock hitting 0.8 by the end of next week (100% increase)

CEO and Insider trades:
CEO Mr. Murphy is a founder of Torex Gold (TXG-T) a 1.46Bn market cap compnay.  Mr. Murphy was responsible for identifying the Morelos Gold asset from Teck, negotiating the sale from Teck in a very competitive environment, arranging the $240million+ financing, and was very involved in recruiting the board and management.

-90,000 shares sold through insider trades  between jan-feb this year ( a tiny amount) 
+560,000 of options brought by company members in October 2020.

Overall, this is ultimately a long term play but i can see a lot of movement in short term when forums get a hold of this (recently added to 212) and when the drilling in Ireland Starts.

If; theoretically speaking of course, this CEO can get this company to a level anywhere near the gold company he set up; with purchases of more sites etc, we could be looking at a 7000% increase in the share value over the next 10 years. Personally, i could see the market cap of this company reaching $30Mil soon.",2021-02-03 07:35:04

However, I am looking to put my money into smarter investments and am looking for ideas to help out with for potential growth.

Looking primarily in these sectors if anyone has good feedback or stock/etf options. I am also open to suggestions in other sectors. 

Airlines for medium to short term gains post-covid. I was thinking Delta.

Marijuana for future growth. YOLO?

Clean/green energy for future growth.

I also believe in those sectors so will be easier to follow and continue doing research.",2021-02-03 09:38:35
425,Need some insight on rebuilding my portfolio," 

Hi,

I'm still new-ish to investing and after getting burned on memestocks I'm looking to rebuild my portfolio in some long-term safe bets.

So far I'm holding my AMC stocks (15@ 13-14$) in hopes I might get some profit or break even once they fully reopen. (Gamestop seems to be sinking even after rebounding 10% today,still holding).

I've been looking into investing into some safe bets long-term to make up my memehype losses,bee thinking about these two mainly:

\-AAL, they seem to be stable enough to not go bancrupt due to covid and with the vaccinations process in the US these should be a nice 2x profit once people start flying again,anyone got experience with airline stocks?

\-BB, despite the meme hype around it they seem to be pretty undervalued despite their partnerships with Amazon and cars companies, and their migration into the cybersecurity sector seems to bode well. My plan is to wait out the hype and try to get a couple dozen BB at below 10$ and hold them until they reach 40's (is that even possible?)

Any insight into these two + AMC would be much appreciated,

Cheers",2021-02-03 13:36:59
426,Churchill Capital IV - a meme stock,"Been hearing some chat regarding this as being ‘the new Tesla’ and that investing is a smart move now on the market.

Just curious if this is another meme stock as have seen some news reports on it questioning wether it is.

Anyone have any experience in wether it’s worth investing in or if there is a subsidiary to invest in

I’ve done some research on it but again, it is very difficult to determine what exactly is happening due to the whole situation with GME and AMC at the moment

Thanks in advance",2021-02-03 14:28:33
427,Old fart advice for young investors,"There seems to be a lot of interest in stocks from young investors. I imagine that many will make their way from WSB to this sub because WSB is a bunch of monkeys flinging poo. You may have lost some money and now you want to explore stocks from less of a Meme and emotional perspective. 

There is nothing wrong with Meme stocks. Meme stocks can be fun. I have had fun with it. I am also a 42-year-old man with rental properties, commercial properties, and a few small businesses. BB, NOK, AMC, and even GME are all fine. The DD is fine behind all of them. The issue is that if I lose $1,000 then I can write myself a check from one of my businesses for $10,000 to make myself feel better. That is not a brag...it is simply sharing that people come from different places in life. 

You are just starting off life and probably have far fewer resources and every dollar matters more. 

I challenge anyone to CMV but I am not a big proponent of stocks as a core investment strategy. Here are my reasons why.

1. Information has a time-decay of value. Meaning that information becomes less valuable over time. Data is what is mined to often produce new Information. You are at a disadvantage when it comes to both data and information. The information that you get on a retail level has already lost much of its value. This is where the saying ""if you read it in the news you are already too late""
2. You have no power. You simply cannot compete with whales and whales don't become whales by letting people glean the crumbs that are leftover. They have the power to move markets, you don't.
3. You have no control over outcomes. You have no control over the success of a company. You have no control over other investors. You have no control over anything.
4. The odds on options are not that great. Even compared to blackjack our betting the outside of a roulette table they are just not that good. 
5. Many people that are far more intelligent than you are, lose money at stock investing.
6. Your emotions and FOMO will be a hindrance and problematic. 
7. Most stock investors are too young to understand the market cycles

I like stocks as a small part of an overall investment strategy for young people for the following reasons.

1. Time is valuable and you have the most time
2. Compound interest is the ""force"" behind all investing and compound interest compliments the stock market very well
3. Certain strategies can complement long-term wealth building

Building wealth through stocks is like trying to build a house one brick at a time...just you, and you are gathering the straw, digging the mud, and pressing each brick by hand. When it rains many of your bricks will wash away. If the sun shines for enough days then you will make good progress. 

The problem is that all markets cycle. The housing market cycles. Petroleum and natural gas cycles. The stock market cycles. I believe that a full market cycle is around 18 years with around 7-12 years in an up cycle and 6-11 in a down cycle. In the stock market, they call these bull and bear markets. We are currently in one of the longest bull markets on record due to interest rates and the feds printing money. No one has a crystal ball but sooner or later the market will peak. When this happens Boomers will be the first to pull money out and put it into bonds or CDs. Boomers are as big of a whale as retail can get. Anyone and I mean anyone could have made money in the current market. If ten years ago you had asked a five-year-old to pick five of their favorite things and invested in their choices you would have made money. That could be Barbies, YouTube, Pizza, Sprite, and their Dog. They would have made money on any stocks you picked around those five things. 

There will come a day sooner or later when Boomers and GenX will see trends in the market that they don't like. Boomers own multiple houses and are deep into retirement. GenX is a small but powerful generation that is now on the back Nine Holes of life. Gen X will largely inherit the wealth of the Boomers. There will come a shift towards mitigating losses and that shift is not far away. When they move their money from markets so goes the market.

Is it fair to say that one of the longest bull cycles on record could transition to one of the longest bear cycles?

Let's look at Millenials...a generation that is struggling to just buy a home. Boomers own a few. GenX may own a couple and Millenials that are now entering into their forties struggle with one. Millenials are a massively sized generation that I believe is now bigger than both GenX and Boomers combined because Boomers are dying at a rapid pace. Millenials are the generation that were adults starting life and careers in 2008 and full-blown families with Covid-19. Maybe one of the unluckiest generations. 

GenZ is this very talented and intelligent generation. Y'all are creating disruptions in culture, in politics, and in Wall Street. You are savvy and demanding. Giving billionaires the finger while pissing on the front door of their mansions. 

But you need to be careful.

Stocks are not the key to your success. They are just a single tool in your toolbox. A better tool may be early homeownership or owning a small business. Life is about options...and I am not talking about the gambling options of Wall Street. I am talking about the options of having equity in a home to adapt to economic swings. I am, talking about the options of owning a small business where your day to day decisions make you smarter and more valuable. Where you own assets that make you money. Most importantly you have control over your own destiny.

I am not telling you not to invest in stocks. I am just telling you that it should be a limited part of your overall strategy in life. Unless someone has been through two complete cycles of the stock markets then I would take their advice with a grain of salt. 

General advice:

1. Don't sell stocks that you have taken a loss on
2. Buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying
3. Invest in stocks with a strategy based on your knowledge and experience
4. Invest only what you can afford to lose
5. Stocks work best with time. Leave them alone
6. Be a value investor
7. Invest with a purpose

Number seven is important. For example, I like Robotics, AI, and Automation. I like these is two specific areas....transportation and mining. I operate in the Transportation industry. I know that very soon human drivers will be eliminated and self-driving trucks will take over. Trucks will be loaded, driven, and unloaded without a single human being doing any of that work. With that will come an entire supporting industry. Tow trucks will need to be automatically dispatched when trucks break down or in accidents. AI will need to be involved in decision making. I will see these changes before I am dead and I am 42.

I like underwater mining. Our oceans are the next frontier and the next gold rush. We have areas of sea bottom that has very little life but is rich in gasses, minerals, and thermal energy. Automation, AI, and robotics will play a huge role in underwater mining. I will see this transition start in my lifetime and I am 42.

Beyond that, once we have machines that are capable of underwater mining then we have the basics for machines that can mine inner-system planetary objects. From nearby asteroids to the moon, to thermal energy collection closer to the sun, to Mars and beyond. The wealthiest person in existence will be the person that is able to start the first off-planet mining operation. Where there is no EPA, no taxes on land, where we are not building sub-divisions next to mines. Where we don't have to worry about the ecosystem. Where gasses and pollutants are not pollutants because there is nothing of consequence to pollute. The largest land-owners in existence will be the owner of off-world mining operations. That may not happen in my lifetime...but it may in yours.

I like investing in Meme stocks because they are fun. But I also invest in Robotics, AI, and automation with one-single question....is this company taking humanity one-step close to automated transportation or underwater mining? I invest with a purpose. 

Sure I will grab up some value stocks every now and then. People are going to be flying more than ever in a few years. People are going to be more social than ever in a few years. Shoot Condom manufacturers are a buy right now because people will be..........you get the idea.

The whole reason that I wrote this excessively long post is to maybe get you into thinking about your strategy....what is it? And to caution you on being ""all-in"" on stocks.

Stonks don't always go up.",2021-02-03 15:05:46
428,Clarifying the SEC's Investigation of Social Media GME Hype for Fraud [Bloomberg Article],"Here is the link to the article:  
[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/sec-hunts-for-fraud-in-social-media-posts-that-drove-up-gamestop](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/sec-hunts-for-fraud-in-social-media-posts-that-drove-up-gamestop)

And, here is the most important point that a lot of readers keep missing:  


>The prevailing narrative is that Wall Street short-sellers were caught flatfooted over the past two weeks as retail traders banded together via Reddit message boards and bought up stocks that hedge funds were betting against. **But some market participants**, including famed short-seller Carson Block, have started to **speculate that the short squeezes that drove GameStop, AMC and other stocks** to exorbitant heights **might have also involved professional investors who either took advantage of the Reddit-fueled frenzy or helped hype it.**  
>  
>The SEC hasn’t said whether there’s anything to Block’s theory, but acting chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement earlier this week that the agency was looking at “compliance with regulatory obligations, adequate and consistent risk disclosure, and determining if any fraudulent or manipulative behavior has occurred.”  
>  
>**There is also mounting concern about the possibility of bot activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets chat** after a spokesperson for the forum told CBS News **that there was a “large amount” of it** and that some posts were being blocked by an automated moderation system.

  
And also all of this:

>Regulators typically start their investigations by using algorithms to hunt through tons of data to try to spot suspiciously well-timed trades, including signs that such bets were coordinated, Bennett said. Then they would try to match up those trades with posts on social media, while sorting out who wrote the posts and what their intent was, he said.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** the SEC isn't going after everyone on WSB - in fact, they're not even saying they're going after anyone on WSB.  If they do, **it's going to be the professional traders** that went in and started **giving misinformation** **and** **attempted to manipulate the subreddit for their gain**.

**Please don't buy into tweets or brief headlines that claim** the SEC is hunting down Redditors and not looking into brokerage apps and hedge funds - they're looking at all angles, and I'm sure they'll bring to justice the people who manipulated the masses - do some DD for yourself and spend the two minutes it takes to read articles in their entirety.",2021-02-03 16:31:00
429,Reminder - Whether you own GME or not - CHANGE YOUR GODDAMN BROKER,"Hello everyone,

Last weekend I created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?), in which I documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities, and which ones didn't.

Before it gets forgotten, I want to bring that list back again, and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones.

This is a much, MUCH bigger issue than you think, and this can and WILL affect you eventually, if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they don't want you to trade. Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:

- General Motors
- Rolls Royce
- Trivago
- Workhorse Group
- Jaguar Health

And [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).

When boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. 

**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.

Here is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):

I’m very new to the whole stock market scene. I was just if you guys had some tips for any stocks I should look into investing into. I recently bought 3 shares of AMC and 10 shares of Nokia but that’s all I have to my stock market career so far. My current watch list is out of my price range at this point in time.I’m using fidelity and currently watching things like Apple, Nokia, Blackberry, Naked, Tesla, Nio, Nike, Bionano, Microsoft and Plug Power.

431,My first few days in the crusade: a current reflection,"Hello comrades. New guy here.

So earlier this week I decided I wanted to join the crusade after seeing a meme saying that buying GME (and AMC, BB ect.) is a fantastic way to...oh let's see I had the analogy written down somewhere... oh yes.. 

""forcibly bend over yonder hedgefucker heathen and shove a sexual instrument of excruciating proportion unlubricated into their rectal cavities in retribution for the same they rendered in 2008.""

Being in a fiscal pickle myself, and a know-nothing on stocks besides, I decided to take out $25 dollars and start an investment account to play around with. Within a few hours I had acquiered my first AMC stock and 3 SNDL as they looked promising (at least for a few hours). I admittedly caved to fear, then simped back to getting one more SNDL. My accounts value dropped to $13. 

This morning I put my big boy pants back on and took another AMC at 8 or so bucks and some other tech company who's ticker is banned (why?). I now lay my head down with $3 cash in the account and my account being valued at $17.

I'm being told I'm doing it right but all memes aside I'm hoping I am. Here's hoping AMC lifts off comrades!",2021-02-03 22:36:57

We've been told to hold, and I'm continuing to do so, until we go to the moon. But when can we expect to see some actual hedge fund action, that is when are they forced to actually make good on their bets? I was told they were due all days this week and that everyone should hold until at least Friday (some said Thursday, today), can we expect the squeeze to happen today or tomorrow, or are we right now just holding to fuck with the hedge funds (which I have no trouble doing)?

When Warren Buffett says ""be patient"" he means you buy a majority stake in Coca Cola and then wait 50yrs while engaging in a nice dividend reinvestment plan. He was not talking about a stock like GME!

I hate to do this, but sometimes you need grab the wheel because the person trying to drive is fucking up.

437,"rWSB is losing direction and becoming fractured. Remember Apes: alone weak, together strong (AMC proposal)","First, what do I mean by losing direction and becoming fractured. Before the whole GME explosion and influx of subscribers, there was pretty much one theme on the subreddit: make huge gains or go down trying. **When the GME proposal came up, everyone was pretty much in sync to make huge gains or go down trying.** Now the subreddit has been split by a variety of different camps:

\- The OG WSB crew

\- The fresh first time investors looking to start big

\- New lurkers/spectators checking out the show

\- Seasoned investors looking to pick up the next big stock

\- Corporate accounts/bots looking to astro turf

**You'd think that with more people, WSB would grow as a force, but the problem is so many people are split:**

\- Some people are holding/buying GME for another explosion

\- Some people are holding/buying AMC, BB, NOK, etc.

\- Some people are selling because they CAN'T or SHOULDN'T be making any more losses (totally fine)

\- Some people are selling because they just want to go back to other stocks (totally fine)

\- Some assholes are selling/buying puts and then laughing at anyone buying/holding GME, BB, etc.

**Whatever the ""right"" move is, I think it's important to remember and to let new people know that the core of the WSB has been and should continue to be: make huge gains or go down trying\***

If you made money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then congrats! But if you made money and then came here to call others idiots, then get lost

If you lost money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then I'm sorry. But if you lost money and then came here to insult people who didn't/couldn't want to buy/hold, then get lost

**Regardless of the Gamestop event, this sub has and will continue to make huge gains and huge losses. It happened last year during the pandemic. It happened two years ago with tech (AMD anyone). It WILL continue to happen. Embrace the swings and don't put others down**

As for the proposal:

Before people, I'm not calling for people to sell GME. While I'm skeptical GME can rise to $300 again or sustain mid $60s, I'm more than happy to be proven wrong and screw the cheating hedge funds. So if you're holding/buying for those diamond hands, more power to you

**What I am suggesting is that new/returning people on the subreddit look at investing in AMC.** I think focusing on AMC is the right call because:

\- The stock is pretty cheap in comparison to GME. It's simply easier to have everyone join in a mid $7 amc stock versus a mid $60 Gamestop stock. NO APE LEFT BEHIND

\- The stock does still have significant volatility to make huge swings. Compared to Nokia for example, AMC has the potential to rise significantly in a short amount of time

\- The company itself is on the upside and people are getting optimistic that the stock could naturally reach $20 long term without the help of this subreddit (theaters opening up, vaccine rollouts, etc.). Meanwhile, rallying people to Gamestop is a tough sell when Gamestop probably won't maintain $60+ value in the long term (again, happy to be wrong here)

\- It's received a bunch of coverage. It's simply easier to get people informed compared to some random stock

\- The argument could be made that there's still value to be made off of a short squeeze

In short, **I'm proposing AMC as a stock with potential to get everyone on the same page, but any low priced stock with potential would work (as long as the subreddit is united). We have a bunch of new people and attention now. Let's not waste it by tearing each other down or splitting into various factions**

**TLDR: in bold**

\* It's important to note that you should always make huge gains or go down trying within reason. NEVER invest money that you are not prepared to lose. NEVER put yourself at risk of bankruptcy or depression

Edit:

Just wanted to clarify a few things:

\- The divide in the community I'm talking about is with users of this sub insulting one another based on their stock positions. There are examples of people insulting me in this thread itself that prove my point. **Don't let money turn you into an asshole**

\- **The AMC recommendation is just that. A recommendation**. The same way people hyped up Tesla on this sub, I see potential in that stock and it's cheap so that's why I'm recommending it to new people over GME, but I'm just an ape so what do I know ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

\- **To people thinking that I'm desperately trying to bump up the value of my positions: no**. If I really wanted to make money, I'd be on r/stocks not here playing it risky. As someone that works in software, the couple hundred that I invested is not gonna make or break me, so losing it is fine with me. When DFV talked about GME, did y'all accuse him of trying to make a quick buck off of his stocks? I'm not a legend like him, but you get the point",2021-02-04 12:57:27
438,"Learned my Lesson with Buying into the Hype, but Will Still Hold Long Term","I bought shares of AMC when it was $10. I could have sold at $20, but chose not to. When purchasing, I chose an amount that I was comfortable with losing, but also an amount that could provide me with significant returns if it went up a lot like everyone thought.

Few things I've learned from this... Don't buy into something just because everyone is doing it. Sounds easy, but evidently for many of us it's not. Whether you want to call it FOMO or peer pressure, you need to understand what you are getting into and the ramifications if it goes south. I bought in because of the hype and I think this has been a good learning moment for me. One of the biggest things I've seen is the fact that there's so much false information going around that it's crazy. I can't count how many posts that say if we hold to this day and keep the price above X amount, it will go to the moon the next day. Truthfully, it seems majority of the people sharing these things know nothing about stocks. I have student loans that need to be paid off. My hope was that I'd be a little closer to paying those off more quickly than previously planned.

I am happy that I didn't purchase GME as I almost did when it was at $300. The great news is that AMC was at $10 for me and I still believe it will go higher than that. I don't think it's going to the moon. But, I do think we can eventually get to $20-$40 in the next few years. Millions of people have been stuck in their homes for about a year now. Once we get past Covid/many have the vaccination, people will go to AMC to watch the movies. There will be many amazing box office movies coming out in the next few years due them being delayed by Covid. So, AMC hasn't popped off like I had hoped for, but there is absolutely no reason to sell right now in my opinion because this is a long term play that can make me some money in the future. 

Who knows... Maybe it will still go to the moon. I'd be thrilled! But, until then I will hold and be excited for the future when going to the movies is a popular thing to do again. 

I'll probably get down voted for this post, but I think this is the truth for many of us here. Be careful with investments. I still hope for momentum to shift and make massive gains, but I also want to be realistic. I won't advise anyone here to buy or sell off these stocks. Ultimately, we have to make our own decisions. 

I started investing about a month and a half ago before the meme stocks. I was actually doing very well in that little time. This sets me back, but I will not make the same mistake again in the future. I'll stick with making smart choices and not complete risks.

TLDR: I bought into a meme stock. I learned my lesson. Don't fall for FOMO/Peer pressure. Make the best decision possible for yourself knowing the risks. A lot of people will lose money due to this. While I was in for a quick dollar, I will hold long-term now.",2021-02-04 13:38:24

442,Capital Gains Tax,"So after finishing up 2020 I had some money laying around and decided I wanted to dip my toes into the stock market and ended up buying a decent amount of shares in GME(Gamestop) and AMC. Fast forward a few weeks and well I'm sure everyone has seen the news. Needless to say dumb luck can be a wonderful thing. I ended up making around 35k in total. So now I'm trying to figure out what to do to prepare for 2021 taxes. I'm married with a child but my wife is working on her phD so has no real income. Our household income is usually around 100k and with HSA, FSA, 401k, etc I can usually get down to the 12% tax bracket. So my question is what should I do with this money ? Putting in a saving account seems like a waste. We have little to no debt besides our house. I was thinking about maxing out my 401k for the year.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Got extremely lucky with the first two stocks I ever bought and I'm trying to figure out what to do to prepare for Uncle Sam. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;

Side note my wife is pregnant again(it is still early) but there will be alot of medical bills since we are on a high deductible plan. I'm hoping that will help some.

Edit: sorry wanted to clear up some points. The gains have been realized I got out before the stocks came back down and I held them for about 3 weeks. I know I will have to pay taxes. I'm trying to figure out what to do with the money until I pay the taxes. Sorry I am brand new to buying and selling stocks. I usually just put my money into our 401k and Roth IRA. This is my first time actively buying and selling.",2021-02-04 15:18:58
443,"BB is the only one that broke its correlation with the other ""BANG"" stocks (AMC, Nokia, Gamestop) and traded upward today.","Honestly don't think its market manipulation like what WSB claims (i.e short ladder attacks). I already mentioned this here, but there are probably hedge funds who haven't shorted Gamestop who gauged the insane market sentiment of retail investors. So they rode the BB/AMC/NOK/GME wave, and then pulled out leaving retail as the bag holders.

But unlike AMC, NOK and GME, BB finally broke out of the correlation, and traded upward today. Which is a good sign and maybe due to the common sentiment that it's very undervalued and potentially has a very bright future with the IoT and EV market.

Fidelity Research gives it an average analyst score rating of 8.9/10 (9-10 is in the very bullish range), with the most notable analyst being Zacks Ranking. Seeking Alpha seems to place it at a fair value price of around $15-17. It's now around $12. Let's see how this plays out.

444,GME and meme stock an expensive lesson to learn.,"I started trading stocks last year when corona happened just like other people did. I'm a university student who got laid off due to the pandemic and have yet to find a job since. When meme stocks blew up (BB, AMC, NOK, and GME or BANG) I jumped on the bandwagon thinking it's a fast way to make gains overnight instead of waiting for a company to grow organically. I spent 80% of what I have to my name and bought out shares of BANG, unfortunately, I have now lost 75% of my initial investment. Really expensive lesson but now I've learned and will grow from this and come back stronger. Luckily, I made a deal with my mom when I started university so I don't have any bills to pay other than phone bill, gym membership, netflix, spotify etc. Just the basic stuff so I can still live off of what I left myself with for at least a few months. I'm also in the last semester for a Computer Information System degree so I'm hoping that I can get a job and get back what I lost. I will be holding my meme stocks until I die as a reminder of my very expensive mistake. If they go up great, if not it's no big deal as I have come to finally accept that I lost. Just something I wanna get out of my chest to be at peace with myself.  
  
edit: Really thankful that you guys are really supportive. For everyone on this thread who also said they lost money on GME hopefully we all bounce back from this stronger than ever.",2021-02-04 17:11:58
445,GME Likely to Rebound,"“In 2018, investors short-squeezed Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), a cannabis company, sending shares skyrocketing from $30 to $210 in less than a month. Prices then dipped to $100 before recovering halfway to $160. Most short squeezes tend to follow a similar pattern – 1) a massive spike, 2) a steep fall, 3) a partial recovery, and 4) slow sinking back to earth.

https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gme-stock-vs-tlry-short-squeeze-companies-1.png

GameStop and AMC have mirrored this rise, but at a far faster pace. After reaching multi-year highs last week, these stocks quickly gave up their gains as short-sellers and options traders adjusted their positions. And though both companies will likely embark on a short-term recovery that could last 3-4 weeks, their stocks will probably sink back to fair value over the next 9-12 months.”

446,I can’t believe how many people are more retarted than me!,"I’m pretty retarted, I only knew so much about stocks like fucking 101 basic shit and think after all this I passed 102 with a C- so don’t take what I say as any financial advice unless you like cheating of the second dumbest kid in class and that would make you the most dumb, got it?

Note with that said, if you’re serious about GME Game Stop and or AMC then have the mind set for LONG GAME! Some of y’all came to play checkers instead of Chess and didn’t even know to play EITHER! These stocks have real potential for future steady growth (Yeah I know boring stfu)

AMC is (mostly) debt free, that will allow them to now use money to improve, innovate, adapt and become better than they were before Covid! Look at this like a golden opportunity when you can say you owned a bunch of AMC stock and a year or two from now it’s trading at apple prices. 

Same for GameStop with all of its reasons (come on we’re all know them by now if you don’t just look at the countless thread mentions) but in case you’re to stupid or lazy here is Cliff notes

Chewy/Amazon people are now GameStop people, experience in e commerce, GameStop can be a massive e commerce gaming with the added benefit of brick locations, gaming is huge and always will be.

So see there is ACTUALLY DD to own both these companies as long term secure investments.

So quit fucking asking “WHEN IS THE SQUEEZE?! WHEN DOES THE STOCK GO UP?!” It goes up when it fucking goes up! Buy the stock if you BELIEVE IN IT AND OR STICKING IT TO WALL STREET but don’t buy it hoping to get rich quick or you will if you haven’t already set yourself up for disappointment!

447,Seeing large after hours spikes in price and volume-- what does that indicate about the next day's opening price?,"Hi all,  


Beginning investor here! I managed to get out while the getting was good on meme stocks (AMC), and am now trying to make more-or-less sensible trades, with the principle being keeping half in long-term investments, half available to capitalize on day trades with.   


That said, I was curious about how some of my stocks were doing volume-wise after hours, and while I was looking at after hours volume ratings, holy heck! Pinterest shot up 7 dollars a share with a volume of 5.139 Million!  


Speaking more generally though, if you see a stock that's rallying huge during after hours trading in both price and volume, how does that influence the next day's trades? Is it going to rocket even higher? Bounce back down? Or does that vary depending on the stock in question? Sorry if this is a rookie question, but I couldn't find an answer just googling.

Holding the stock does not increase the price, especially not if the average cost of purchase is above the current price. 

It looks like Wall Street collectively made more money than they were originally going to make if WSB didn’t do this thing. Holding makes you retarded

I still own 3 GME stock and 20 AMC stock for the meme but I pulled out the majority of it out at $300 as it went much over what was originally thought possible. I feel bad for the millions of retards who joined late to buy 2 or 3 shares @ 300 because the people who came 2 weeks earlier and spent the same money would have made at least $10k profit with the same investment. This is why the price won’t increase maybe I’m just retarded I don’t know. Can we talk about something other than GME now as this sub is not what it used to be",2021-02-04 19:40:26

454,YOLO trade strategy for Investors who kept getting FCKed this week.,"As a financial analyst with 2 weeks in Wall Street Bets. I believe that I can share this view with you since I have the same experience as any Harvard or Yale grad has when they join a wall street hedge fund. 

Instead the media and hedge funds taking WSB investors for dead. It would be a good strategy to make a very public statement that WSB is here to stay. The top two stocks that the media connects WSB with is GME and AMC. While it would be awesome it where GME, its just too expensive. 

Any investor who has the ability and wants to believe that WSB can be a hedge fund for the masses the best way to do so is by converting GME stock to AMC. Right now roughly 1 GME = 5 AMC stocks. Anybody who would follow this strategy that owns GME would increase their leverage 5X against the AMC shorts. This strategy is not just about those that own GME if there are autists who don't own GME they would still benefit buying the stock as it is cheaper than pre pandemic levels. The timing of this strategy is good. This is at the end of the week which means that whoever is managing their shorts are going to rebalance for the next week. (research pending) This is a perfect time to force the short squeeze. 

Full Disclosure: own 1000 AMC stock at $7.14 this is not financial advice

Turn those diamond hands into diamond FISTS and shove it up the shorts' ass!!

455,I believe this wave of stock market interest could be great in the long term,"The reason $BANG lost its momentum(edit) (BB) (AMC) (NOK) (GMC) and others is because stock brokerages halted the trading of those stocks when it was at it's peak causing a myriad of issues and the prices dipping shortly after. People bought into the craze of the stocks emotionally because of the whole David vs Goliath comparison and sticking it up to the Billionaires which I think is great but frankly they have much more experience and information than us when it comes to the Stock Market. They pay thousands of dollars to a service that now gathers data on which stocks get mentioned the most on r/wallstreetbets. [See Here](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/03/investing/wall-street-reddit-hedge-funds/index.html) And that's just one of the things they are willing to do now that they know what a collective can do. We can move markets.   


> Pick the brokerage with the strongest balance sheet. What ruined it on RH is that they didnt have enough cash to deal with the growth in accounts, margin loans and volatility. The EXACT SAME THING will happen at the next broker if you dont make sure they have a MULTI-TRILLION dollar balance sheet to be able to handle these kind of circumstances   
\- Mark Cuban

As Mark Cuban says the problem with stock brokerages is that they didn't have a strong enough balance sheet to handle all that stock craze.

People right now are learning the ropes and mistakes made in what has happened which I believe now makes us stronger. We know better on how to stock market works and learned from our mistakes and lots of people due to this situation know better than before. So if something like this were to happen again it could significantly go better. This wave of newbies that can search and read up on resources about the stock market could be better in the long term. They can do their own Due Diligence and not trust random posts anymore. They are now more financially literate and can research on which companies to invest in and which not to and not put emotion when trading. They have learned lessons from this experience.
(Edit)
The problem here was that we didn't anticipate that they would get this down and dirty to this level. $BANG is for the short term. We have to start thinking long term with other companies so start checking others out to diversify your portofolio. GME is getting a rehaul into their business so its worth to still hold (not financial advice and not a financial expert) and i think BB is getting into software and NOK is sort of becoming a network provider in some areas and AMC will still exist after the whole pandemic ends so take those information with a grain of salt and do with them as you will.

457,Covered Call Strategy Using AMC Bags,"Hey all,

So I have been a long term investor for the past 10 years and have done rather well.  I figured I would use some play money to try and see about the AMC bandwagon that was hyped up.  I got in at a 5 dollar cost basis but have a large amount of shares now sitting in my account that I do not want to sell as my own personal DD views it at a decent long term hold depending on liquidity.

Thus, I have started looking into the concept of covered calls.  I know I am comfortable exiting the position between 12-13 dollars.  What am I missing in that I could start selling the covered calls, collecting premium, and lowering my cost basis.

I will say, I am comfortable if the stock drops, again I recognize the risk of short term dip given the GME dump, but I am also happy to hold it for a year for a post COVID recovery play.  Thus, not worried about the stock dipping on me, and if it sells at my strike perfect, because that is where I was happy to sell anyway.  Am I missing anything here?  I am rather new to the option game and am still reading various resources, but I want to make sure I am not missing out by doing weekly covered calls for a premium on Etrade.

A message to all AMC holders

There’s no need to expand in the last couple of days, our precious AMC stocks have been tanking every day, but I’m here to spread a message of calm and prevent burnouts. 
Apart from all the dirty shit they been pulling (I truly believe this ir market manipulation because GME chart looks exactly the same) we have to be calm and trust in AMC here’s why: 
•AMC is actually a good long term investment, they been saved from bankruptcy and now they been opening some movie theaters. 
•with vaccines we can hope as time progresses, restrictions will ease up and cinemas will be attended again.
•right now you might be staring at a 50% or more loss, but be calm, its not irrational to expect the stock to go back to 15-20 at one point in this year.
So we might lose these battle, but the war is not over, there’s no point on selling with a loss, also there’s no point on stressing tf out because this isn’t going the way we expected to, be patient and trust the process, Covid won’t last forever and thanks to us AMC is now healthier than it was.",2021-02-05 12:10:23

“
On February 1, 2021, Wanda America Entertainment, Inc. (“Wanda”) converted its Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class B common stock”) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), into an equal number of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”). No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.
 
The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section M of the Charter, which provides that each share of Class B common stock shall be convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company. Pursuant to Article IV, Section M, the shares of Class B common stock that are converted pursuant to this section shall be retired by the Company and shall not be available for issuance.
 
The conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of the Class B common stock:
 
Voting Power. Prior to the conversion, Wanda as the holder of shares of Class B common stock was entitled to three votes per share of Class B common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company’s shareholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class A common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a shareholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Charter and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion.
 
Economic Interests. Because holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to the same economic interests to which Wanda was entitled with respect to its Class B common stock before the conversion, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction, the conversion had no impact on the economic interests of Wanda.  
 
Capitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class B common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. The conversion also had no impact on the Company's total number of authorized shares of capital stock.”

466,Who's Ready for the ETH Squeeze? 10k Possible in 2021,"Ethereum has been on a tear lately, >26% in the last week, >56% in the last Month, 750% y/y.

The meteoric rise is causing new investors to flock to the crypto markets, with ETH firmly in their crosshairs. This is causing the price to continue to rise, and will do so uninhibited at least until the $2k level, then we hit some potential resistance.

This upwards momentum is going to cause shorts to have to cover, further driving the price upwards. We saw this happen with the meme stocks GME, AMC, NOK, etc... but this is different. ETH is the future of defi and ETH 2.0 is the real deal (over $32 Billion locked into the defi market)

Based on this, I think 10k is a real possibility in 2021. It may be a spike price, but the upwards trend will continue for ETH, making it a great long term hold opportunity.

I like ETH more than BTC this year, a lot. Like a whole lot. And I doubt you'll be disappointed if you get in at the $1600 - $1800 levels",2021-02-05 20:02:42
467,"AMC: An imploding time bomb, and put spreads to capitalize","Hi Everyone,

For everyone considering an investment in GME's little sister - wanted to open the floor to a few facts and why AMC is not GME and how ""big finance"" has already dumped on retail investors, and are about to celebrate big plays for round 2.

Facts-to-date:

1. In the midst of this mania, Silver Lake & Mudrick Capital, two scummy vulture investment firms have already quietly extracted almost **$1 billion** dollars from retail investors. See [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E) and [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/mudrick-capital-gains-200-million-on-amc-gamestop-in-wild-week). These guys are celebrating the best play they've ever made on their yachts in the Hamptons right now... to put the size of this into perspective, the value of every single AMC share combined was **$500M** two weeks ago
2. Many here have said ""well I don't care, AMC share price is 'only' \~20% above pre-COVID times"" have it completely wrong and are forgetting how many shares AMC have been issued - there are currently \~3X as many outstanding shares, and the current market cap is **400%** of what it was pre-COVID. See [here](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap). Adding to the pain, the moves above added even more shares to dilute the value (though elimination of debt does have some positive EV offset)
3. Unlike GME, there aren't the same conditions for a widespread short squeeze. Short interest between 15-30% depending on how you [count](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355987915105566721) it, multiple funds involved, and plenty of days and liquidity to cover.

**The kicker:** There are BIG incentives to keep prices elevated in the short term. AMC has already stated they're in the midst of considering whether to [issue more shares again and dilute you further](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-capitalraise-exclusive/exclusive-amc-entertainment-explores-new-capital-raise-amid-stock-surge-sources-idUSKBN29Y03C), which would be the mother of short squeeze killers.

**The insider conundrum:** What might seem bizarre and bullish is that based on the SEC filings to date, the largest insiders have NOT exited their positions yet, unlike insiders at Koss who were happy to unload their entire portfolio. Unfortunately, altruism and optimism are almost certainly not the explanation as share prices are still far above what they would've rationally expected for years to come. These insiders are bound by both SEC laws and their fiduciary duty - they can't say no to raising more capital if it's in the best interest of the company... but the SEC won't allow them dump their shares if they're on the verge of diluting them. They're mulling over the capital raise carefully, because doing so would also reduce the value of their stake unless they can put the cash to work in a value accretive way. They're left with two options:

1. Issue more shares and see if they can effectively take advantage of the cash in a way that overcomes dilution (e.g., buyback, content plays)
2. Keep the prices inflated and wait until enough time has passed for their lawyers to clear them and dump on retail

**The imploding landmine:** Both of these moves would kill both the value of the shares and the potential for a short squeeze simultaneously, and ensure share prices go back to normalized values at $2-$4 depending on the level of optimism for AMC's future

**The play:** Puts on AMC were prohibitively expensive due to IV since last week, but IV has been creeping down drastically as the price flattens. If AMC prices remain stable through Monday - put spreads post earnings should be the way to go, conservative with buying a 6P and selling a 3P

tl:dr: AMC is disguised as a a cheaper version of GME, but it's a pump and dump scheme where the winners aren't who you think they are

Edit: Getting a lot of PMs... to be clear this isn't an endorsement for/against GME. But one of these two companies has issued more shares during the mania and has told you they're debating whether to do it again, and that creates a more interesting investment thesis than betting on reddit psychology for the next month. It also doesn't depend on others joining the cause or holding the line. Not a financial adviser and will be putting my money where my mouth is.

471,I built a tool that shows the number of total mentions on reddit and short interest for each ticker,"Here is the tool: [https://www.plotlion.com/short-squeeze-indicator/](https://www.plotlion.com/short-squeeze-indicator/)

Last week I was caught off-guard by the GME/AMC  short-squeeze. I thought it would helpful to have a tool to sum up what people were talking about on reddit, and the likelihood of that causing a short squeeze.

This finds the top shorted stocks in the market, and counts how many times they are mentioned on reddit everyday. The logic being that stocks with high short interest and a high number of mentions on reddit could be a good candidate for a GME like short-squeeze. Obviously this is not a perfect metric, the short interest data is biweekly so some have already been squeezed (looking at you GME 😞). Opportunities like these don't come easy, but when they do, **buy straddles**.

I’m also planning to send out a weekly email to recap the movers in our list. Definitely sign up if interested

Let me know what you all think. Would love any feedback to see how I can make the tool more helpful for everyone.

Thanks!

472,My First-Ever Stock Purchase - AMC,"I'm over 50 years old and made my first-ever stock purchase of AMC a bit late in the rally when it was selling at over $12.00.  I'm not what anyone would call a wealthy man, but I have a slush fund that I can use with discretion.  AMC closed 2/6/2021 at $6.83.

I'm not a hero trying to flash my diamond hands here, but I am going to hold AMC because I believe in it.  The time will come when it will repurpose itself to serve a broader audience and, consequently, it will begin to make money again.  I believe this in my soul.  It may take months.  It make take years.  Yet, it will return to its former glory.

473,$AMC buy and hold till launch,"AMC has more drama than your typical soap opera but rarely has a stock has such a payout opportunity. No, they won’t hit $40 again... $15 sure, but even at $15 a lot of people will sell since it seems to be when most people bought in hoping to ride it, dropping it quickly there after. 

AMC may not launch this coming week (though it could). But if it doesn’t, it will then drop when people sell their losses. I’m F’in Buying if that happens, lowering my cost average. 

AMC stock will level out high within 3 months. They are open now which is minimizing their losses. They are renewing leases which is increasing confidence. They are controlling their debt (lots of positive this past week). Everyone wants to get back to normal and you better believe once they are back to full capacity they will be raking in the revenue and increasing their profits from this past weeks debt reductions.

I was thinking about AMC stock though, and I think that it might be a good long term investment. I’m new to the stock market though so it might not be. I heard that AMC was able to pay off their debt using the money they made by selling more shares during the craze, so they’re no longer in danger of collapse due to debt, and with the vaccines starting to be rolled out, life should be getting back to normal mostly in the coming year, so I expect they’ll be getting a lot more business.

475,AMC Stock: A Retard's Short DD," TL;DR: Low(er) risk, high reward.

On   Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow  the same exact pattern.  While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.

Reason: More shorts.

Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:

[https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce](https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce)

Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?

On Friday, GME opened at 54.04, and AMC opened at 7.17.

GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around 6.9.

3% of 7.17 is .2151. In other words, 7.17 - .2151 is 6.95.

10% of 54.04 is 5.404. In other words, 54.04 + 5.404 = 59.444.

So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?

13%.

The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?

13%.

For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.

GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \*started\* it's rise in the aftermarket.

[the dark blue for AMC is broken in the spike on the right, it was identical to GME.](https://preview.redd.it/xeng554cyxf61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5f913a840d0f1009db5362fa8712572b2d1429)

GME   is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling   down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive,   and there's more volume to play around with.

However, even if you look at these stocks objectively,

Yahoo   Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as ""Neutral"" despite the amount   of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the   performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term.    People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is   neither stock dead in the water yet?  Why do both stocks show more   resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?

People   shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money   on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily.  Everyone is waiting   until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate   those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily   shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business   before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can   make ""easy money"".

Consensus:   Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and   definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday   than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum  that  GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME  because  they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike  wasn't  relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point,  AMC's  shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype).  If the momentum  dies,  then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this  stock  are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price  for  months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of  having to  pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the  people  shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck  off.

Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?

476,What I've learned from investing so far,"28 yo male. I've only been investing for about 7 months, but man have I learned a lot since then. I wanted to point out a few main things for other newcomers. And I'm also open to any new advice anyone on here has to give. Like I said, I'm still rather new, so please don't be too harsh with any criticism.

So I started investing with the intention of saving up money quicker than I would with a regular savings account. I still have money in a savings account since you never know what could happen with the market. Anyhow, here are a few things I learned:

**1: Buying stocks and learning to stick with them (as long as you believe in them)**. So I had some stocks that I bought because I liked what I saw when I researched them. They weren't doing too much at first, and I would watch other stocks that I was interested in but hadn't yet bought that were starting to move up. I did what your average novice would do and sold my shares of said stock to buy the ones that were increasing. I didn't want to miss out on this opportunity while the other stock was just lying dormant. Problem is, and this is something that I didn't realize at the time, is when a stock shoots up suddenly, it's bound to drop back down a bit soon after. So I would buy that stock and watch it increase a bit, and as I said it would drop lower in price. Then wouldn't you know it? The stock that I previously had, then sold to get this new stock, started going up. Seeing this, I would then contemplate selling this new stock just to go back and buy back shares of my first stock. This is a good way to lose money, especially if you use a platform that charges fees for this.

**2: It's okay to buy more expensive stocks, because it's more about the percentage increase**. My pricier stocks were ones that were my long term holds. I didn't care about the price of Apple because I didn't plan on selling it anytime soon and knew that it would be worth more than I bought it in the future. But there were some stocks I was looking at back around July/August that seemed kind of pricey to me. In actuality, they were maybe about $60ish, but I didn't want to fork over that kind of money if I could only afford one stock. As a result, I was looking more into penny stocks. These penny stocks tended to get me nowhere. Over time, the stocks that I thought were ""too pricey"" were now at about $100 a share while my penny stocks either went down or gained about 2 cents. Fast forward to today and I'm buying stocks that are about $200 like it's nothing (not literally) because I realized that a 20% increase of a $200 stock is more than a 20% increase of a $4 stock. Now the percentage increase doesn't mean everything when it comes to this line of thinking, but it's pretty darn important. There are many cheaper stocks that can take off but that typically takes time. And based on my own decisions as a novice, patience is something that you likely have to learn when it comes to the stock market.

**3: It's less stressful/more sensible to buy 5 shares of 4 different stocks than it is to buy 1 share of 20 different stocks**. Some may disagree, and since I'm new I could be wrong, but this is how I view it. I decided to make my first real stock purchases with companies that I could hold for the long term. AAPL, MSFT, SQ, etc. After having a few long-term stocks, I began to look into short-term stocks. This would be stocks like DKNG, NIO, etc. Things were going well overall, but realized that I only had like 1-2 shares of each stock. I would see some stocks such as NIO and PLUG shoot up while they're still cheap, which was nice, but I only had 2 shares of them. Meanwhile, other stocks I had barely moved. Now I've only been investing for a few months at this point, but had I bought more shares of these stocks, I could have seen an even bigger profit. Instead, I chose to buy a share of this and a share of that, rather than stocking up (literally) on these stocks while they were cheaper. Point is, buying in bulk, or even adding to your current shares over time, is a smart move. Buying 1 share of 20 different stocks isn't necessarily a bad idea, but by the time you've bought that 20th stock, some of your other stocks may have seen big gains that you missed out on because you were busy spending money on others, just so you could have it in your portfolio. I ended up selling some stocks completely to buy more shares of others.

**3: It's easy to become obsessed with investing**. I would constantly search new stocks online and see what the next big thing was. When I wasn't searching for new stocks, I was checking the ones I already owned multiple times a day. It's okay to check your portfolio throughout the day, but remember, if you have stocks that you believe in and don't plan on selling right away, it's okay to take a break every now and then. In fact, it wasn't until I adjusted my portfolio and got rid of some penny stocks, became more patient, etc. that I was finally at peace. I didn't think about or search stocks as much. It's a very great feeling to feel free of constant thoughts. If you're happy with your portfolio, there's no need to buy other stocks or sell your current ones. Just buy the dips.

**4: Avoiding FOMO and impulse buying**. Man I wish I didn't even have to mention this one. But this is the biggest mistake you could possibly make, as least based on my experience. I had a great portfolio as of 2 weeks ago. Just a quick summary, I had:

1 share of MSFT

1 share of SQ

5 shares of AAPL

3 shares of SE

1 share of DIS

2 shares of NIO

2 shares of PLUG

2 shares of BE

13 shares of DNKG

10 shares of NNDM

1 share of ARKF

I was extremely happy and content with my portfolio. Then the meme stocks happened... Seeing GME shoot up overnight, then AMC starting to take off, I decided I wanted to get in on it. It's basically free money, right? That's what everyone's saying. WRONG. I bought some shares of AMC and BB, with AMC being the bulk of it. GME went from $40 to over $400 in a matter of days, so I invested heavily into into AMC, thinking it could go up a decent amount. AMC was about $20 a share at this point, as was BB. I needed money to invest in them so I sold ALL my shares of DKNG, BE, NNDM, and ARKF. Then I did a big no-no and took money out of my actual savings account. Something I told myself I would never do. Before I knew it, I'd spent about $1000 on AMC and $350 on BB. Turns out, I bought at the peak of both of them. I bought 44 shares of AMC at an average of $21.65 and 19 shares at an average of about $17. Now the DUMBEST thing I could've done aside from investing in this in the first place, was trying to ""compete"" with a friend or whatever you want to call it. He had 50 shares of AMC that he bought at about $2.50. So I wanted to also have close to that amount so I could also have big gains. Not so fast. Not even 1 minute after buying these shares the price went down for both stocks. I was hoping it would go back up and even told myself that if I broke even, I would sell. I didn't care about profits at this point. The AMC stock went down under $7 after hours and I was down quite a bit. I wasn't as worried about BB because I believed that would be a long-term hold anyways, but AMC was scaring me. I held it for about a week and a half, waiting to see if it would go back up and it didn't. At one point, it went up to $17 and I thought about cutting my losses and selling, but I figured if it went up that much then maybe it could go a little higher. Nope. It dropped down to $13. Then $10 the next day. Then $9 the next. I thought about holding for awhile in case something crazy happened and it went back up, but I just didn't have the stomach for it. Now for my next mistake; I bought 10 more shares for a total of 50, with the thought that maybe I could average down. This didn't even move my average price down by a dollar. Then I came to my senses. The next morning, I decided I made a mistake and to take a loss. I sold all of my AMC. About $670 worth. Now I can't even begin to explain how great I've felt since then. Sounds weird to say after taking a loss like that, but the idea of not being obsessed with checking my phone ever 5 minutes to see if the price went up so I could cut my losses was like a weight lifted off my shoulders. Right after selling AMC I bought back a few shares of DKNG and tried getting some of my old portfolio back. There were a lot of mistakes made because of this, but they could have all been avoided had I not YOLO'd or bought because I wanted to make money that everyone else was making (or so I thought).

**5: Learning when to cut your losses**. This one hasn't been an issue for me until the whole AMC debacle, but it's important to know. If it's becoming more and more clear that a stock price is dropping with no end in sight, many of you may panic sell, which in this case could be your best move. Others may continue to hold, with the hope that the stock will magically recover. And others will hold simply because you're scared to let go and lose your money. I had this same thought for the last 2 options, but think about this: you're down $300 and don't want to lose it so you hold. Next thing you know you're down $400. Now you could continue to hold and lose more. Likewise, you could continue to hold and maybe months, years, or even decades down the road you will finally break even. However, although you're down $400, there's still another way of looking at it. Say you sell and lose the $400. Sucks, right? Of course. Anytime you lose money it sucks. But instead of holding and you lose even more money, you take whatever money you have left from that loss and any other money you want to invest, and you buy shares of another stock. What if that stock ends up netting you a $500 profit? Now you've technically gained $100 since taking that loss, versus losing even more than that $400 had you continued holding. You also could have been missing many more investment opportunities while you were holding for a loss. Money could be passing you by while at the same time you're losing some. There's not one person in the stock market who hasn't taken some sort of loss. Some are bigger than others, but a loss is a loss either way. And sometimes taking a loss is the smarter move in the long run.

There are a lot of things I've learned from investing, and I've made a whole lot of mistakes, but it's all a learning experience and sometimes you really have to make these mistakes yourself in order to learn from them. I never thought I would have been caught up in the AMC/GME craze, but here we are. Just remember that no matter the mistakes you make, there's always room to grow and ways to get back on track. Good luck out there.",2021-02-07 03:10:49
477,"140k in savings, is my plan good?","First of all it's 140k euro (I'm spanish), and I'll probably use Degiro mostly and Revolut (for small stuff).

I have few expenses, and don't have a family to sustain.

My plan it's:

- Keep 40k in the bank + my salary. Until now everything was in the bank giving me nothing... Also I want to buy a house in the next years.

- 85k in ACC Degiro Comission Free ETF's. ACC because how spanish taxes work:

   - 72k in [IE00B4L5Y983](https://www.morningstar.es/es/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0000MLIH) (Comission Free)
   - 13k in [ETF IE00B4L5YC18](https://www.morningstar.es/es/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0000MLIC) (Comission Free)

- 10k in 4 solid stocks companies: Stuff like SBUX, DIS, MSFT, AAPL

- 5k money for stock opportunities but not coming late to the party. My first investment has been 35@16,90 in AMC (which I'm still holding...) so I have learnt a valuable lesson about volatile stuff. Although thanks to it I found out about investing instead of having 140k at my bank giving me 0 interest.

Additional questions: 

- Should I put a lump sum in ETF's as soon as I can or space it out (and try to catch some dips)?

- Can Degiro comission ETF's be better for me than the CF ones if I do a lump sum?

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

I'll cover many things that I think will be generally beneficial for newer traders and investors first, but if you're just looking for my current observations on GME, write about it and the end, so feel free to skip the wall of text in the middle if that's what you're here for :).

One thing I would suggest for newer traders, particularly following the Robin Hood fiasco, is to transition to a more powerful broker/platform.  As I've mentioned a few times, I use TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim platform (see very recent review [here](https://www.stockbrokers.com/review/tdameritrade)).  They don't pay me to promote it or anything, other than that I can say that my portfolio performance has been greatly enhanced by the capabilities the thinkorswim platform provides.

I've gotten many questions and comments requesting guidance on educational materials.  I haven't responded because I am honestly not the best person to ask about that.  I will say that the resources listed in this sub (to the right of the list of posts) look to be fairly comprehensive and excellent in quality.

# Awareness, Ideas, Thesis, Due Diligence

Most common question I got since my last post about my process for identifying trading and investing opportunities.

At a high level, it all starts with awareness and various ideas about how the world around us is likely to change, and what the market currently anticipates (you will commonly hear phrases like 'X is already priced in', or 'the market is already discounting the fact that', etc.).

Regarding GME, the idea I had was that some struggling retail and other businesses, which had been left for dead by the market, would actually rebound fairly quickly, and perhaps benefit from pent-up demand as the vaccines rolled out.

Ok, that makes sense, but how, in fact, do you take your awareness of the world, take some of those ideas, and actually do something with them?

I tend to start with running a screen (screen as in a sieve, not screen as in what you're staring at right now) in thinkorswim.  Other platforms have similar tools.  [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) is also excellent for a web-based tool.  These allow you to filter stocks by various types of criteria.

As an example, I might start by filtering for:

* Stocks in the retail sector
* Market cap >65mio, <3bn (I find that to be a good range for minimally stable micro cap to smaller mid-cap that is likely insufficiently covered by analysts, and therefore more likely to be substantially mis-rated by the broader market)
* PE < 7 (nothing magic about 7, that's just what I decided to use as a relatively but not ridiculously low PE multiple)
* Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio >1 (i.e. they can cover fixed costs out of earnings, so imminent bankruptcy risk is likely lower).  Note that if you're looking ultra deep value you might actually specifically want to find companies at risk of bankruptcy at first glance, to dig through in detail to find ones that look more likely to turn themselves around from the brink for some reason.

Etc.  It takes longer to think about what kinds of filters to use than anything else.  Once I've set those criteria up, you just run the scan (click a button in thinkorswim) and out pops a list of stocks that match the criteria in less than second.  On 2/6/2021 running the above scan gives me 9 names (of which, funny enough, Express--apparently another meme stock short squeeze play based on just looking at its chart for 2 seconds--is one).  For those who are curious, the list I got was: ANF (Abercombie & Fitch), GES (Guess Inc), PLCE (children's Place), DBI (Designer Brands inc), GCO (Genesco), CAL (Caleres Inc), CHS (Chico's FAS INC), CATO (Cato Corp), EXPR (Express Inc)

At that point I might quickly check the charts to see what the daily action has been like for the past year, looking for patterns that might be interesting.  I'll pick PLCE for this example, since it is breaking out strongly, and looks to be about to smash through resistance of the price on the eve of the pandemic crash.  It also apparently blew out its last earnings estimates, which doesn't hurt.

At this point I might proceed to check their SEC filings (lots of insider buying a few days ago, Blackrock increasing stake, recently new CFO, etc.), whale wisdom, company news etc.  I found an [interesting article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/childrens-place-other-retailers-catch-133301579.html) from earlier last year that seems particularly positive--they have apparently been a leader in the retail sector in developing their digital omnichannel, with a large and foresighted investment made over 3 years ago, which made them particularly well-positioned to deal with the challenges of the pandemic (at least as far as bricks and mortar retail goes) and indicates very good things about the strategic vision of their management team and board.

It was a ridiculous bargain in November, but may still have room to run even today.  Not an endorsement or telling you to go buy some of the stock, but that's my quick read.

With the above 30 minutes of research done, I might make the decision that it warrants further investigation.

As you dig deeper, you start to build a working thesis or theory on how the company is going to deliver performance, or get enough attention from the investment community to warrant a re-rating outsized gains in share price (the bull case).  Then you try to find all the reasons and evidence as to why that isn't going to happen (the bear case).

From that point on you iterate as many times as seems prudent to you, depending on how much of your portfolio you intend to invest.  Since we're all here already, summarizing and posting your due diligence to this sub seems like a no-brainer.  It is very likely you'll get good feedback to help you refine your thesis even further, or perhaps stop you from making what might be a big mistake.

Even if I decide not to make an investment at the moment, at the very least I might add that stock to a watch list, etc.  I can actually set thinkorswim to give me an alert if any new companies pop up that match those criteria from now on.  This type of feature is pretty common with screening tools.  This might happen if, for example, a struggling retailer gets its cash flow in order and crosses from <1 FCCR to >1 FCCR.

A process very much like the above is how I found GME to begin with, and subsequently found my way to Reddit since there was so much GME-related traffic.

The Market is so much bigger than GME, so I highly encourage you to use the knowledge, tools, and techniques you've learned about or been exposed to to explore that bigger picture.

# You, The Market, The Trade

If you've found something that looks interesting enough to warrant actually investing, it's worth spending some time to further think about precisely how you think you should do so before you just hit the buy button.

If your thesis and time horizon are longer-dated, then stocks are likely your best bet.

If instead you have a very specific time window in which you're interested, or have reason to believe the stock will move by a certain date, then options might be much more capital-efficient with a higher return (though a much higher risk of greater or total losses as well).

There are many ways to express your ideas or bet on your thesis.  In fact, your thesis about a particular company might lead to trades on an entirely different company.  If your due diligence on a key industrial company that primarily supplies parts to a certain car company shows major investment in technology and production efficiency, that might also bode well for their customer, and thus warrant an investment there as well or instead.  My DD on oil storage capacity getting full back in April led to me taking some speculative positions in oil tanker stocks, as another example.

You may also modify the way you position your trade based on market conditions.  Jon Najarian (a CNBC regular who focuses on options trading) recently described how he is transitioning his portfolio using a stock replacement strategy.  This means using various options strategies to try to mimic the performance of stocks, but without holding stocks directly.  The reason for this is that he is increasingly concerned that we may have a large market correction in the near term, and would like to have a defined limit to potential losses (a feature of many options strategies).  I don't know if he's correct, but his moves make sense as a way to address his concerns.

Another thing I've referenced a few times in my post is writing cash-covered puts to essentially bet against the price falling vs betting that the price is going to rise.  This comes with the added wrinkle that 'losing' (i.e. the stock price in fact falls below the strike price of the put) comes with the added feature that you end up owning stock.  For this reason I commonly use this as a strategy on high-confidence stocks as a way to gain some revenue if the price goes higher, and effectively buy the dip if it goes down first.

How you express your thesis in terms of the specific trades you make can greatly impact the likelihood and magnitude of your returns, and the profile of your risk.  Buying the stock you like, while straightforward and with a very intuitive risk/reward profile, may not be the best way forward.

That being said, it is critical that you do understand the trade before you execute, so I would highly recommend practicing via paper/simulated trading--which, by the way, is a built-in feature of thinkorswim--before you execute a complex multi-leg option play.  Ok, I'll stop shilling for the rest of this post at least :).

# Back to GME

On Thursday and Friday what I believe we saw was despair-driven selling compounded by the tug of war between shorts that entered at $150+, and shorts still piling into the trade.

Overall short-side sentiment is more cautious at this point than at the highs despite supposed sentiment among short-side players that GME is a $10 ($20 at best) stock.  This is reflected in Ortex data showing utilization dropping below 100% for the first time in months (i.e. shorts are no longer borrowing every single share they can get their hands on), and short interest stabilizing over the past few days.  As of Thursday utilization was 69.3%, and free float on loan was at 44.1%. Data for Friday should become available just before Monday market open.

The reason for the above, I believe, is that while shorts seem to believe current prices are still a good entry point, they need to be concerned about getting blown up if a short that entered at the squeeze highs decides to cover and lock in profits.  The removal of restrictions on GME by Robin Hood adds another element of risk.

The lower the price, the likelier that deeply profitable shorts cover, spiking price while doing so at the expense of the newest shorts, and the easier it is for retail sentiment to move price, so we're in a sort of very fragile equilibrium until the larger shorts that entered at the higher price points have covered.

I'm not sure how to estimate when this would be, other than to say that the lower the price goes, and the more days that pass, the lower the incremental profit potential and higher accumulated interest cost for the short position holders, so I don't expect them to hold those squeeze high short positions for very long.  It is possible that the spike on Friday was a push to cover a fair bit of those positions before the weekend.  I would also expect that they will move to cover if somehow momentum seems to turn to the long side, which would accentuate and accelerate the the inflection of momentum greatly.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my last 130 shares of GME at this point.  It's possible I hold them for a while to watch how things play out for the next few weeks, but I wanted to give everyone reading my post fair warning that going forward I may make an intra-day decision to sell part of all of the position.  I will, however, keep open the cash-secured put position, as an automatic entry back into GME at an effective $30 price point if the price is <$40 by April.  I may open new positions based on developments as well.

On a different note, I took some time to once again review my thoughts and decisions over the course of the trade.  While doing so I was reading back through my posts from 12 days ago (only 12!?  feels like it's been at least 3 weeks...) reminding me that I had previously begun building a position in [AMC as a value play](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4j5y0/amc_short_squeeze_potiential/gkotklz/?context=3) (via a couple of march $3 strike calls) on rumors of imminent rescue/turnaround financing.  I was originally planning to build a better position once I had time to study the potential trade structure better, but instead unloaded them at \~1000% profit for a net \~$2000 gain to concentrate further on GME when I was re-positioning my portfolio, not even realizing at the time that AMC was another stock with a legitimate short squeeze momentum thesis (LOL, I really should pay more attention to social media).  I just glossed over the profit as about what I was expecting off the bounce from market rerating the stock from ""bankruptcy is imminent"" to ""holy cr\*p, the studios need AMC for their movies to make money!"".  I should have realized when I was getting so many messages from people asking me to do for AMC what I was writing for GME.  I didn't even do any DD on the short interest there(!) and ignorantly advised people that they should only pay attention to the value thesis as I [channeled my inner Charlie Munger](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4j5y0/amc_short_squeeze_potiential/gkp2b73/?context=3).

I guess it just goes to show that you only have time to look so far into so many things at once.  As I've mentioned previously, trading is a hobby of mine, and something I do in my spare time.  I'm not sure if I would have been able to coherently manage momentum trading two stocks that were basically printing money in overdrive at the same time to take full advantage of either trade, especially while writing daily posts.  Try to keep that in mind if you choose to pay attention to what I write :).

Also, apologies if you've messaged me and haven't gotten a response.  I will sometimes try to respond if I have time (and a good answer), but if you have a good question it would probably be better to either post as a comment or your own post so that you can get a broader range of responses, and also so that the responses can be seen by (and therefore benefit) everyone.

Hope you're having a good weekend, and good luck in the market on Monday!",2021-02-07 05:10:12
479,Biotech Longterm Play,"Hey everyone! 

If anyone is trying to drown out noise from GME, AMC etc and are looking for some quality DD, I encourage you to take a look at the r/bcrx subreddit page. A ton of top tier DD coupled with solid conversations and anecdotal experiences. 

The group currently has 1300 members, and the BCRX page on Stocktwits has close to 33k watchers. 

Most of the retail invested in BCRX have been around for close to 1 year now (myself included) and pledge not to sell any shares until we achieve fair value, which currently is still very far away.

If you have a spare 30 minutes, we would appreciate you giving our page a read! If it doesn’t interest you, no biggie. Our mission is simple in that we are trying to spread awareness of a highly shorted, fundamentally sound, under-valued stock.

480,DD - Electrovaya - EFLVF - $1.55 - TL:DR,"**What do they do?**

Electrovaya Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and markets lithium-ion advanced battery and battery systems in Canada, the United States, and internationally. It provides lithium-ion batteries to power materials handling electric vehicles, including fork-lifts and automated guided vehicles; and electric transportation applications; as well for electric stationary storage and other battery markets. In addition, it provides electromotive power products for electric trucks, electric buses, and other transportation applications; industrial and residential products for energy storage; and power solutions, such as building systems for third parties. The company was formerly known as Electrofuel Inc. and changed its name to Electrovaya Inc. in March 2002. Electrovaya Inc. was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Mississauga, Canada.

**How do the Financials look?**

Expectations from some of the Canadian Electrical analysts is that Electrovaya is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2020, before generating positive profits of US$4.8m in 2021. They are using their money/borrowing facilities effectively and a press release from Sept 2020 and the [Walmart](https://electrovaya.com/press/electrovaya-completes-delivery-of-lithium-ion-batteries-to-walmart-canada/) contract shows Electrovaya borrowed and repaid in full CAD $5.5m. From what I have been able to see in the accounts and press released - the finances are starting to look very strong again after some very challenging years. This is backed up by the [debenture repayments](https://electrovaya.com/press/electrovaya-completes-the-repayment-of-its-15-million-debentures-and-its-10-million-purchase-order-financing-facility/) and the loan facility. 2020 was a good year compared to 2019, revenue up near 3x and when we look at the customer base it will become clear that this stock is poised to have a very good year ahead. You don't get many pennystocks that are repaying their debt, making a profit and actually have a positive earning per share.

**Customer Base?**

Biggest recent news is the contract with [Raymond Corporation](https://electrovaya.com/press/raymond-and-electrovaya-announce-strategic-supply-agreement/) but they trade with and have engaged with some pretty impressive names in the past. A company with a $200m market cap must either have some very strong technical fundamentals or some excellent networks to be engaging with the likes of Mondelez, Mars, Walmart and Raymond Corp (Toyota). My view on Electrovaya is that the Raymond deal will take the business to anywhere between $350-$500m market cap and another big contract with any of the above can propel them to $1bn market cap. With the growth in the lithium ion battery sector, personally I would not be surprised if $1bn MC was achieved prior to the end of 2022. Big growth but lets take a look at where Electrovaya plan to grow.

**Growth?**

In short - my view is that there will be a lot of growth here. Why? 3 reasons.

1 - Existing Customer Base - Walmart and Raymond have re-ordered or upgraded their initial contracts, once Electrovaya are in, they clearly perform well, provide a high quality product and as a result they are impressing some of huge corporations enough to re-order and upgrade on initial terms. The past three years have been about consolidation, focusing on tech and now the orders are coming in. Exciting time to get involved as a shareholder.

2 - The Green Economy - Probably the single biggest factor here in why I believe the growth will be significant. You've probably seen nearly every single 'green' company pumped to high heaven, most have doubled/tripled or even gone higher in price from when you first saw them. The green economy is going to be huge and the fact companies are going through huge share price increases with very minimal news, means it is an attractive sector to be invested in. EVs, batteries, raw materials for batteries, renewables and Genomics are probably the hottest sectors right now and rightly so. Electrovaya fits into this natural growth very nicely.

3 - Target Sectors - The true EV space is very congested, lots of companies are making passenger vehicle batteries, Quantumscape, Lear, Tesla, Panasonic, Romeo... the list goes on and on. Huge need for change, which is exactly why so many companies are trying to fill the void. However Electrovaya have decided against re-entering this market, previously supplying Daimler and working with GM and Chrysler appears to have made their mind up the passenger vehicle EV battery market is not for them. Strong focus on buses, vans, handling goods and autonomous robots is where Electrovaya are heading - for me these are more raw in terms of opportunity, share price upside and generally had a lot less focus and maybe because there hasn't been a Tesla like success story in this area as the average investor may fail to connect with the product and the need for change. This will all be changing very soon though - emerging companies like Arrival aiming to change the bus and van industry for good. It definitely brings a sense of realism into the Electrovaya strategy.

**Patents?**

Afraid this bit of a bit of a copy and paste job from their [website](https://electrovaya.com/technology/#patents), but in short - over 100 patents either granted/applied for - the main ones being listed as:

* Electrode Pre-lithiation
* Solid State Coating Process
* Unique Microstructure Homogeneity
* Parasitic Electrode/Electrolyte Reaction Mitigation
* Ceramic Composite Separators Materials

Personally find the solid state coating process the most interesting from an investment perspective. In a market that is expanding extremely quickly with companies investing millions into R&D, I'm not saying it will happen... but companies like Electrovaya could easily be acquisition targets for a major player. There is no doubting the strength of their tech, even to someone who has no idea about electric battery tech, a five minute search would bring to the fore that Lithium and Solid State tech are the future. Why invest in R&D and when you can buy it ready made? In a market where SPAC's are going crazy, traditional M&A's are still viable at the right price. Speculative but not impossible.

**Short Interest**

I felt it wouldn't be in keeping with true 2021 fashion if I didn't mention this... no this is not 128% shorted, I'm not one for GME/AMC (although maybe I should be...) but the short interest in Electrovaya is decreasing pretty substantially - 16% last week, with days to cover at 0.7 - both bullish signals. In terms of shorted cash - circa $600,000 is all that is being shorted.

**Insider Buys**

In the past 12 months, there has been more insider buying (4,000,000 buys) v insider selling (52,805). Whilst the buys were at a discounted rate and also took place around 12 months ago, I would still say that this is a bullish move, only slightly tainted by the 52k being sold but when you look at the total value, it isn't that much money for an investor and also very low in terms of sold share value to market cap.

**Summary - TL:DR**

At $1.55 for an EV battery play that actually has proven tech, patents, extremely large (and critically financially stable) customers that keep coming back - I think this is certainly one to keep an eye on. Value wise it has some room to run, around $2-3 is where I'd expect to see this in the current market conditions. Should they obtain a bus or van contract, with good volumes (50-100k units per annum) then this would quickly start heading to the $1bn market cap. They've gone through some rough times, restructured, pivoted and now look poised to excel through the next 2-3 years. 

My position on this is 1000 shares at $1.27.

KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) — A Kalamazoo man has paid for digital billboards referencing the Reddit group WallStreetBets and the short squeeze of hedge funds that have been occurring with stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment.

Photos of the Save AMC billboard at the Wings Event Center are going viral on social media.

Brett Reath, the man behind the billboards, says he is poking fun at Wall Street and wants to bring attention to what hedge funds have been doing for decades by shorting stocks.

The messages will appear for a few days during the morning commute and evening rush hour.

“I thought it was a really interesting way to kind of shed light on the situation that’s been going on,” Reath said.

483,AMC Major Stakeholder Wanda Converts Stock To Allow For Sale,"A major Chinese investor in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) converted its shares in the cinema operator in order to be able to sell them, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

What Happened: Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a unit of Beijing-based Wanda Group, converted its Class B common stock to Class A AMC shares on Feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.

No details of how much stock was converted were given out in the SEC document.

The Chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in AMC for $2.5 billion in May 2012.

Why It Matters: AMC is still a majority-owned subsidiary of the Wanda Group, as per the latter's website.

The theater chain along with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted), and Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) are targets of r/WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.

The short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as Melvin Capital and Citron Research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.

The Reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and others.

In late January, AMC shares shot up as much as 804% at one point. The stock is up over 200% on a YTD basis as of Friday's closing.

Price Action: AMC shares closed nearly 3.7% lower at $6.83 on Friday and gained almost 0.6% in the after-hours session.

484,"Thank you to all the kind, seasoned veterans taking the time to educate new traders like myself.","I feel I need to post this to deflate my ego. I lost some money on the hype of GME/AMC and humbly cashed out after reading a post on here saying to cut loses and move onto the next possible money maker. 

I immediately started researching and better educating myself on options trading, which is how I ended up here. I'm taking the time to learn different strategies and WHY those strategies are implemented on certain stock trends. Learning the ""Greeks"". I'm trying to learn as much of the fundamentals as possible so I don't make the mistake of the above mentioned ever again.

I've checked out the sidebar and FAQ, which has a lot of great information for beginners such as myself. I feel like a sponge and want to learn as much as possible. Thus, if anyone has links, informative websites, or just personal experience they recommend for a new trader, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn.

I have a portfolio on E-Trade with $3500 to start (10% of my liquid portfolio, -5% lost on FOMO GME/AMC). I have long investments <250k that is managed through a financial advisor. Thus,  I'm not learning options trading with money I absolutely need for Daily needs. My goal is to breakeven, or make 10% in my first year while learning the fundamentals. I hope this is a reasonable goal to obtain?.

I guess what I'm getting at is, I appreciate people in this sub taking the time to help educate new traders. Thank you once again, and I'm truly appreciative of the seasoned veterans taking the time to help out the new guy!

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Tesla invests $1.5 billion in bitcoin, which soared to all-time high

> * Tesla, in a SEC filing, said the electric auto maker has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin after changing its investment policy last month. Bitcoin soared over $43,000 in an all-time high Monday. The Tesla filing also said, “We expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been talking up bitcoin and dogecoin, another cryptocurency, in recent tweets. Shares of Tesla rose in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 3. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 5. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/StockMarket?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, February 8th, 2021! :)**",2021-02-08 08:45:30
487,A non-meme 'macro' analysis on AMC (DD),"First of, I'm not a financial advisor or professional investor, nor do I currently own any $AMC stock - but I might very well own the stock after the market opens today.

There are currently TONS of different $AMC content all over the internet pointing in many different directions. Most relate to $AMC's role in the recent march against Wall st. started by [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/). Whilst I wont go too far into details with that story, the aftermath of those same events are why I have come the the conclusion that $AMC might now be a viable short to mid-term investment (admittedly a risky one).

The current state is:

* AMC is still highly shorted - **78.24% of float.** (as of today, according to Marketwatch.)
* AMC is now trading around their **early 2020 pre-COVID-19 level** **@ 7,5$** (6,9$ in pre-market today)
* AMC has received **ALOT** of media coverage
* AMC has received **a financial bail-out card** and now has cash to operate into mid 2021
* The **COVID-19 situation is loosening its grip** on the company going forward into 2021

As mentioned, I'm gonna focus on the 'macro' indicators and current situation more than the financial numbers. However, it is important to mention that the financial situation of the company is no longer critical in the short-term. This fact is important because the former, seemingly, un-viable financial situation, was one of the bigger reasons the stock was initially shorted in so high numbers.

So what are these positive 'macro' indicators?

* Lockdowns are ending
* Citizens are hungering to reengage in recreational activities outside their homes
* 2021/2022 are going to be great movie years, due to many big titles being delayed
* Rumors/possibilities of strategic partnership(s) with producers - it makes sense, because there will always be a demand to experience high-end movies on high-end equipment.
* A renewed short-squeeze is still possible, although that is not my reason for being bullish - it's merely worth mentioning.

All in all, I think that the high level of short interest is the main reason why $AMC is trading at currently levels and I see no reason, that the stock could not rise to meet pre-COVID trading ranges around the 10$ mark.

**TLDR: $AMC is currently undervalued as prices to not reflect the companys improved financial and market situation.**

**Edit 1: spelling**",2021-02-08 08:50:20
488,I bought AMC stocks and now I'm scared.,"I recently got into investing and decided to use 100$ to learn about stocks before pumping in more money. I did a quick research and saw AMC being a ""decent investment"", completely unaware that it was a meme stock.(My fault, I shoulda done more research.) I bought it when it was at 6.70$ USD thinking that it would go up, but the second I bought the stocks, it went downhill. Right now, I lost 17$ and I don't even know if it will ever go up. What the hell do I do now?

And how do I avoid this kind of stuff in the future?",2021-02-08 10:48:44
489,What do you guys think about this portfolio for a young first time investor?,"AMC 4.91%
BB 18.1%
WEED 19.41%
VEQT 22.64%
VFV 18.32%
VGRO 16.62%

I know AMC is a meme stock, but I have such a small amount of it that I don’t really mind holding it to see if it picks back up when cinemas open back up post covid. BB seems like a good investment considering their new deal with amazon. WEED(canopy growth) seems like the biggest and most well managed of all the big weed companies and I believe that it will gain a lot of value when the US inevitably legalizes at the federal level. The rest are ETFs for long term, less risky holds. I only have about 1500cad distributed between all of these investments. Let me know what your thoughts are!

Edit: why am I being downvoted for asking a question?",2021-02-08 11:48:06
490,At what point should we come to terms that AMC won’t see $15.00 for a long while?,"I currently own 15 stocks.  One of those stocks is AMC.  The 14 others are a combination of tech, EV, and weed stocks.  Most high risk/high reward but a few “safe” bets such as AAPL, AMD, and NVDA.  

I bought AMC at $15.85 a couple of days before it tanked.  I’ve been holding it hoping that it recovers to just break even, but I’m not too optimistic about that now.  I’m currently down 62%.

I do ok picking the rest of my stocks.  Even with that clunker AMC, I am running at about an 18.5% gain across my entire portfolio

So my question is this, should I dump AMC and reinvest the remainder in a better stock if I can average an 18.5% gain on this new stock?  I know at that percentage it will take me a while to recover the 62% I was down, but at least that money will be working for me than just sitting there wallowing in its redness.",2021-02-08 12:16:42
491,Weekly SPAC Rundown 2/1 – 2/7," 

*The below references an opinion and is for information purposes only. It is not intended to be investment advice. Seek a duly licensed professional for investment advice.*

**$CCIV** – again reached crazy peaks based on retail buying. $CCIV had run up on reports the Saudis would be on CNBC only to sell off when the Saudis made no statement about a merger to $CCIV only to run up again on news that Lucid’s CEO would be on CNBC only to sell off again when he stated he could not confirm or deny any negotiations only to then run up again based on the fact that he apparently smiled while saying that. At this point $CCIV has reached meme stock status along the likes of $AMC and $GME and its valuation is just based on however many people can be convinced via facebook, twitter and youtube to keep buy into it. If Lucid decides to go another route expect to see this stock at $10 within a day but if the rumor is confirmed no idea how high this may run.

**$KSMT** – is in talks to take public Nexters, a game development studio.

**$THCB** – finally signed their DA with Microvast. Perhaps long suffering holders of **$THCA** will see a deal there now at last?

**$ASPL** – signed a DA to take public WheelsUp, a private jet charter service.

Indian solar unicorn Renew Power was rumored to be looking to go public via SPAC possibly via **$PDAC** or **$RMGB.**

**$LACQ** – signed a DA with Ensyse Biosciences, maker of a non-addictive opioid substitute pain killer currently in trials. This SPAC had a previous redemption and thus a small float reminding me greatly of $BRPA. Be interesting to see if it also runs up as hard.

**$ACAC** – signed a DA with Playstudios, an MGM backed maker of gambling apps.

**$HOL** – will take public space launch company Astra.

**$VCVC** – will take public Israeli EV startup and Canoo lookalike company Ree Automotive.

**$VGAC** – signed a DA to merge with genomic testing company 23andme. The CEO of 23andme is also on the board of the **$AJAX** SPAC so looks like she is putting her money where here mouth is as far as supporting the SPAC space.

**$FMAC** – saw twitter rumors swirling that it was looking to take public Discord but so far these are unsubstantiated and may have been a pump and dump.

**$APSG** – is in talks to take public Solera Holdings.

**$DCRB** – will merge with hydrogen truck maker Hyzon Motors. Unlike Nikola, Hyzon appears to have working vehicles.

**$DGNR** – will merge with CCC Information Services, a SaaS platform for P&C insurance.

**$GHVI** – is rumored to be in talks to take public Matterport, Inc., maker of software for virtual walkthroughs and 3D modeling

**$RTP** – is in talks with online insurance provider Hippo. Hippo is very analogous to Lemonade which recently IPO’d to great success. $RTP is led by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.

**$FTOC** – will take public Payoneer, the “paypal of Asia” and the company ebay replaced Paypal with for payment processing. Betsy Cohen’s next fintech SPAC will be FTAC Hera and list under symbol **$HERAU** when it launches.

Short sellers Hindenburg Research launched a hit piece on **$CLOV** which went public via Chamath SPAC $IPOC. $Some current Chamath SPACs such as **$IPOE** saw a small dip after the release.

**$NOVS** – completed its merger with AppHarvest. The new ticker will be **$APPH.**

**$NBAC** – has requested to extend their time to merge from February to May. A vote will be held 2/10/21. Those who do not wish to grant an extension can redeem their shares for NAV.

492,BB is not a phone company. Here’s some DD.,"They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, there is no other competitors besides Google, but does not have the patents and broad variety of software that BB provides. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs. 

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies such as Sybase! A billion dollar software company with reported 55 consecutive profitable quarterly earning reports before they were bought out by SAP. Chen also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales. 

Edit: I also want to point out by looking at the TA from February 2nd on, BB is the only stock with a higher moving average to that of GME AMC and NOK. Throughout last week we can see it breaking the meme trend and acting on its own. Sorry I’m not sure how to add pictures but if you have the resources, you’ll see if you overlay all 4 stocks, they move very similar, but BB is the only one that breaks out right before market close. 

Edit 2: There’s a rumor that BB executives sold shares with the incentive to leave, remit ownership from BB, or have concerns of company being overvalued. Shares given to these executives are part of their salary compensation, so under company policy, they have every right to sell shares for capital gains. You can google search this yourself if you don’t believe so. 

EOY target is $60

493,Learning the hard way,"Hello, I'm new to trading (and to reddit) but am already loving this sub. I had played around for a few months and got burned by one bad move. I swore I'd never trade again until GME/AMC blew up. I made money fast, then lost more faster. Trying to learn from it all... Here's what I've gleaned. Feel free to add to it:

1. I am really susceptible to FOMO.
2. YOLO is just stupid and is the evil twin of FOMO.
3. Not diversifying is the best friend of YOLO.
4. Meme-stocks are for fun, not for serious.
5. If I had held and not sold all my previous bad moves (other than meme-stocks), they'd be green and not red.
6. If I had held and not sold all my previous good moves, they'd be twice as green.
7. My real job is what makes me real money.",2021-02-09 07:36:40
494,$AMC.... Not looking at the meme stock but a pivot for $AMC could change the game.,"After looking into AMC for a little while now... I noticed something. They have been looking to pivot their business to cater to diner and a movie. This will be the only out I see for them. In theaters where they have a bar and restaurant, the margins are amazing. The customers love it. This recent round of cash infusion could be used to help with this transition. I could see a streaming service for box office titles as well.",2021-02-09 09:30:34

496,PSA: Call options can & are being used to create un-squeezable short positions,"Know a lot of you are eagerly awaiting the short interest report at 6PM, so here's a quick read in the meantime. Whatever the number is, I'm actually inclined to agree with the AMC/GME bulls that it'll continue to be high, and even significantly understate the number of actual bearish positions (including the synthetic ones). Unfortunately, I also don't really think it matters in the mid-run.

Remember back when GME was squeezing to the max, and people noticed massive blocks of 800c's being purchased and took it as a bullish flag from institutional interest? I'm rather certain these were purchased by incoming short sellers, and here's why:

1. Let's say an institution is short 100 shares today, believing GME will drop from 50 to 30 by end of month
2. They then buy a GME 2/26 100C for $3.38, which might seem bizarre given their belief in the stock going down
3. But using this setup, they're 100% protected if GME temporarily skyrockets to 1000, so long as they leave enough collateral/liquidity to cover the delta between 50 and 100 in between. They never plan to execise the option, but leave it in place to prevent a margin call
4. If they're right, they pocket the $20 less $3.38 for the call option less interest expense per share

Call options enable you to build a hedged short position that's impossible to squeeze. You might ask why Melvin didn't do this to begin with - this is where the element of surprise in a short squeeze is really important. Year long hedges for a super rare occurrence will completely suck out your alpha, and by the time Melvin picked up on this, call options were ridiculously expensive and they were out of capital and time. If you know something's coming and the insurance is cheap, you'll definitely buy it.

I think the short interest % will continue to climb even if the price stays stable and IV goes down, as these hedges will get cheaper and cheaper to purchase. I'm sure this will be very basic to a lot of you, but figured it might be informative to the influx of Reddit new joiners in the last few weeks.

tl;dr element of surprise really important in squeezing the institutions out, and the dropping IV of late is your enemy if you wanted the squeeze to happen. I'm not recommending the position above as I don't think it's worth touching this meme overall given the multitude of other opportunities out there

Edit: For all the people smartly pointing out that this is just a normal hedge, you're right. But it's also a hedge that ironically kills the need to hedge, like flood insurance that prevents raining. So the flood insurance might be boring to you, but some of you might be missing that nuance.

**Note to** r/pennystocks **mods:**

My last post got deleted for some reason, so I deleted some parts that might have not aligned with the subreddit rules (mentioning AMC, and telling people to upvote)

It took me *4-5 hours to read, write and summarize* this. :)

&#x200B;

**SHORT VERSION** for the lazy poops (like me)

* Soligenix SNGX is working on **decent products** which benefit the human species as a whole (Cancer side effect treatment, rare Cancer treatment, Crohn’s, and more). That’s why I was so interested in Soligenix in the first place.
* Growth forecast from **simply wallstreet is: 1.76$ (current price) to 56.58$**, this is probably WAY too far ahead for now though, so don’t expect 3200% immediately. (-> see here[ https://i.ibb.co/5W5hPJK/SNGX.png](https://i.ibb.co/5W5hPJK/SNGX.png) Screenshot of simply wallstreet)
* **Large investors** (some are trillion dollar capital firms) like BlackRock, Bank of America, Vanguard Group. For more information. See below. (sauce:[ https://fintel.io/so/us/sngx](https://fintel.io/so/us/sngx) )
* **Small market cap of 60 million**. (1 billion for a Bio Firm company is nothing unusual)
* Quote from[ https://www.soligenix.com/our-focus/](https://www.soligenix.com/our-focus/) on their product ThermoVax: “This same technology is also relevant to other vaccines for **global use**, and Soligenix is[ currently collaborating](https://www.soligenix.com/pipeline-programs/thermovax/) on vaccines for filoviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg) and for coronaviruse (e.g, COVID-19).”

**EXTENDED VERSION**

I did my Daredevil (DD) on Soligenix, because I am actually interested in the health/bio sector, even more so after this entire pandemic thing started and Bill Gates said that Bioweapons could be a larger threat than a third world war. (Check it out on Veritasium, very insightful and foreseeing conversation)

That’s why my belief is that Bio firms are going to experience a major growth within the next 5 to 15 years. Which means they will also GROW bigly.

I will summarize everything that I have gathered in the last months about Soligenix. I usually don’t trade after hypes (only in Cryptocurrency, when Elon tweets). In stocks I am quite careful since they have real intrinsic values (or they don’t lol).

Full disclosure: I own 200$ worth of shares in SNGX at 1.70$ per share. But I am not only in this for the profit, so restrain from sentences like “MOON”, “BUY BUY BUY”, “PUMP AND DUMP”. That belongs under Elons Twitter messages. hehe Spam him!! Jk.

Anyway here’s the + - List

&#x200B;

**SNGX** Pros +

* **Small Market Cap 60 million**. Plenty room for growth. If it goes to 1 billion (only), that would be 16x of the share price right now. Around \~27$ then, which is quite reasonable for a Bio company.
* Earnings forecast **57.7% per year**. (from simply wallstreet)
* Investors with **good reputations**. Institutional owners make up 14.5% of all shares, rest is public with 85.2%, only a tiny fraction is owned by individuals (0.3%). They include **BlackRock, Bank of America, ACT Capital Management, Wells Fargo and Vanguard Group.**
* [https://fintel.io/doc/sec-sngx-soligenix-act-capital-management-lllp-sc-13ga-2018-july-30-18014](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-sngx-soligenix-act-capital-management-lllp-sc-13ga-2018-july-30-18014) (ACT Capital Management SEC filing document on SNGX share amount)
* Their products **help people with diseases** like:
   * Crohn’s Disease (Inflammation of digestive tract), check their website[ https://www.soligenix.com/pipeline-programs/sgx203-for-pediatric-crohns-disease/](https://www.soligenix.com/pipeline-programs/sgx203-for-pediatric-crohns-disease/)
   * T-Cell Lymphoma (Rare Cancer type, sounds like Resident Evil)[ https://www.soligenix.com/pipeline-programs/sgx301-for-cutaneous-t-cell-lymphoma-ctcl/](https://www.soligenix.com/pipeline-programs/sgx301-for-cutaneous-t-cell-lymphoma-ctcl/)

   * SGX943 for infectious diseases (new type of antibiotic, because people are getting resistant to old antibiotics): This one is actually really interesting. To me at least.[ https://www.soligenix.com/pipeline-programs/sgx943-for-infectious-disease/](https://www.soligenix.com/pipeline-programs/sgx943-for-infectious-disease/)
   * Or just go to **Soligenix website**:[ https://www.soligenix.com/](https://www.soligenix.com/) They have more products they’re working on.
* Soligenix is working on CTCL, which only occurs after cancer has become malignant - so you're technically still dealing with cancer but internally. And no one has done that before. But instances of CTCL is quite rare and is like a bandaid to a cut. (I paraphrased it from u/Aezu . Thanks for the input!)
* They’re working on decent products which really benefit the human species as a whole, which to me is a **very special “purpose” or “why” behind a company**. That’s why I was so interested in Soligenix in the first place. But even from an investor standpoint it sounds pretty solid to me.

&#x200B;

Cons

* Revenue is **not tremendously high** yet.
* Market Cap is **small** (could be a disadvantage too) since their liquidity is not high enough to make moves.
* ThermoVax is still in Proof of Concept phase (PoC)
* There was a drop in December 22nd because an analyst called out a low price target + phase 3 failed.  But the analysts have changed their minds now. [https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/how-will-the-market-react-to-soligenix-inc-common-stock-sngx-stock-getting-a-bearish-rating](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/how-will-the-market-react-to-soligenix-inc-common-stock-sngx-stock-getting-a-bearish-rating)
* Do you guys see more cons?

&#x200B;

Summary:

* I think they’re gonna be large soon, but more so I hope they succeed because which means we are one step further along to humans surviving a Biothreat and friggin Cancer.
* Let me know what you guys think about their goals and products.
* Make sure to subscribe and hit the notification bell. Oops we’re not on YouTube.

Edit 12 February 2021, 9:30AM GMT+1 :

Thank you guys for the awards, comments and stories. I really do appreciate the amount of interaction. Many people have asked me about price targets so I will try to answer this from both an investor point of view, but also as a daytrader/swingtrader/tesseractrader:

Investor

If you're in it longterm, then the fluctuations now shouldn't matter. What's important is the **results of their work** (the BIO Ceo 2021 Conference e.g.) and to follow what they're up to to ensure that it's **still growing**.

&#x200B;

Daytrader

We **broke a major resistance line at 2.00$** (Psychological barrier + resistance) and one at around 2.11$. This could mean we have a lot of space to the top - depending on the volume. The higher the volume, the higher the price will go up. So I guess it depends on how many people read this and actually invest in. So I don't think 5$-6$ - **plus good news -** would be to unthinkable. (Volume has increased be 4.2x to 12 million, which is good for the price for now I guess )

You can expect resistances at around 2.15$ and 2.80$ (that means people have set up limit sell orders).

506,A historical survey of the systemic problem of shorting non-existing stock (naked shorting) in relation to recent events,"A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME

TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**.

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source: [https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)

* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the GameStop hearings coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC. Here's an actual recent example where Prime Brokers are accused of coordinating naked shorting** [**https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\_id=224548&navigationaction=home&page=1&newssection=industry**](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548&navigationaction=home&page=1&newssection=industry)

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment a commenter brought up. On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then if the squeeze was about to happen or happening, if they margin called the shorts, they would go down as well as shorts would not be able to pay and brokers would be holding the bag. They have every incentive in this case to NOT margin call because doing so might also taken them down, instead the most logical option would be to make a backroom deal which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**

508,Buy AMC and sell long term Calls?,"AMC is currently at $5.61.  A Jan 2023 LEAP with a strike of 7 is $3.47.   So, if I bought 100 shares of AMC at $5.61/share, and then sold 1 LEAP at $3.47/share, my net cost for the AMC shares is then $2.14.  If AMC goes up at some point and the option is exercised, I've then sold them for $7 for a gain of \~327% ((7-2.14)/2.14).  If the option is never exercised, then I continue to own the shares at a price of $2.14.

This seems like a lot of potential return with limited risk.  Aside from the risk of AMC being around in two years, is there something I'm missing on this simple analysis?  The WSBers would say I'd miss the short squeeze, but that's moot.",2021-02-12 01:03:56

510,$NSTB / Apex Clearing,"Disclaimer: the merger is a rumor from Bloomberg. 

TLDR: If $NSTB merges with Apex, it’s gonna moon when the investor presentation comes out. 

1. Rumor released 2 days ago by Bloomberg. 

2. Why is Apex clearing looking to go public? I think it’s to take advantage of the volatile market today. With stocks like GME and AMC, the biggest winners are the clearing houses. Like the gold rush, the winners were the ones who sold the shovels. 

3. The investor presentation is going to show a huge jump in revenue, and the purpose of raising cash is to hold a reservoir of cash to back the volatility.

513,AMC - Is it a company in decline?,"**Preamble**

Along with others, I had bought some shares (foolishly) of AMC (200 @ $11).  As I examine what I want to do with the shares now, I started thinking more in depth about what the AMC's future financial prospects are (yes, should have done this up front...).

So I started questioning can AMC get back to 2017 or 2018 levels of stock prices ($14 to $20) or higher?  I am hoping the r/stocks crowd can provide some second opinions (or corrections) to my analysis here.


**Historical Prices**

Looking at AMC's price history in the past 5 years, it was a decline starting 2019 after their first quarter report where it started it's decline and ending the calendar year at around $7 where it started the year at $13.

Considering COVID as extraordinary circumstance, I excluded 2020 as I looked to this.  Pretend that if COVID did not happen what would it have done.

There are others on here where I saw comments that they have been in decline leading up to COVID (2020), so I wanted to see why.  Also I wanted to validate that statement that they were on the downward trend.


**2019 - a special year**

2019 was a special year for AMC's stock prices where it saw it's share price tumble after the first quarter.  Looking at the financials, it is easy to see why.  Looking at their annual balance sheet, you see that their Net Income from 2018 level of $110M went to 2019 level -$149M.  This is a big swing.&nbsp;

Their revenues stayed fairly close between the two years (if any, 2019 went up). So why the drop in Net Income?

*So did AMC end up costing more to operate its business by that much year on year?*

Their Rental and Landing Fees went up by $200M.  
Their Gain on Sale of Security went down by around $90M and their Special Income Charges went down $80M.

*That is a big jump.  What happened in 2019?*

One of the major changes is on how leases are represented in the balance sheet (from my limited understanding of accounting) called ASC 842 where operating leases (which probably represents a big chunk of AMC's balance sheet) will be shown as debt on the balance sheet.  In my limited understanding this means the change in net income if all things are given equal (revenue, actual operating expense etc), net income will be less and importantly EPS as well.  ASC 842 came into effect at beginning of 2019 and the first time it would have shown on the balance sheet would have been first quarter report of 2019 where the share started its steep downward trend on that year.


**So was AMC then making money?**
For this we look at EBITDA or their cash flow.  
Fourth Quarter/Full Year Financial Report from AMC site: Adjusted EBITDA of $269.1M up 11.6% after adjusting 2018 for ASC 842 impact.
So their earning actually went up year on year if we were to compare earnings apples to apples.

Free cash flow (2018 adjusted for ASC 842): 2019 - $303.1M.  2018 - $117.4

That is quite the increase year on year on earnings if reporting methodology was kept consistent.  However, spreadsheet technicality doesn't really give us the whole picture.


**Market growth**

2019 also saw an increase in international markets where it somewhat made up for the decrease in US markets.  However, overall decrease in attendance overall.  Looking at their cash flow statement (which is more a true comparison), their Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by $140M year over year, but their Net Cash used decreased overall hence increasing their cash flow.  While maintaining similar level of screens.  This may mean that their margins were getting better pre-Covid.

If they were to continue the trajectory of international growth (perhaps expansion) and with better margin, they could have done well.


**Comparison with Cinemark**

Picking a cinema operator that lists in North America comparing with Cinemark to see if AMC is better/worse at end of 2019.


Company|2019 No. Of Screens|2019 Theatres|2019 Adjusted EBITDA|Curr Enterprise Value|Curr Market Cap
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Cinemark|6,132|554|$178M|$5.5B|$2.43B
AMC|11,041|1,004|$269M|$11.72B|$1.9B

You could argue that EBITDA (or earnings) should be proportional to number of screens for a theatre company (and it does seem that EBITDA to screen ratio is similar between the two).  So more screens would mean more earnings as long as the screens are operational.

We however see AMC has twice the EV of Cinemark (with less market cap).  EV being market cap + debt - cash, this would indicate that AMC has a lot more debt.

**Outlook**  

Then the question comes down to has 2020 caused irreparable damage to the business that even if things go back to ""normal"" that they cannot reach the level of earnings?

Currently AMC has Impairment of Capital Asset of $2B in 2020 (compare that to $84M).  This is most likely due to the deprecation of the value of their assets (I mean how much are theatres worth as an asset these days).  If things open back up, the value of said assets should increase hence lessening their expense. Along with it revenue will rise as they open up.

However, to weather the storm, AMC had to take on debt and in turn sale of securities which shows as another hit on their expenses this year.  They will need to make ground on this once things are normal.

Overall, AMC looks like a gamble on if/when things will return to normal.  It would be interesting to see how their partial openings of theatres affect their overall cash flow situation.  Their next earnings call most likely would not contain a lot of good news I would imagine, so at least a quarter after where there is enough data on partial opening (along side what movies are offered) would give a better sense of where it is all headed.

For the next earnings call if there is any data on revenue for partially opened theatre I would look to their attendance to number of screens compared to revenue generated.  Then see if the trend from 2019 onwards has any positive trajectory going towards 2019 levels.  Then once they are fully opened, you can have better confidence their revenue/cash flow to recover.  However, this needs to be balanced with what kind of debt they have and whether that can be reduced.

My current thought is to hold at least until their earnings call to see where this is all heading and re-evaluate my position.  There are other opportunities to throw my money away.

I am also going to look at their 2020 financials more in depth to see if there are any useful nuggets that I can understand better what their plan post-Covid may look like.

I don't want this to come off as some sort of self validation of holding the stock.  I actually would like feedback on whether there are aspects of the thought process that I need more education on.  My current position with AMC is 200 @ $11

EDIT: ***There's a tl;dr at the beginning of Fundamentals and Mementals sections.***

## EDIT: YOU DEGENERATES CAN'T READ SO I'LL SAY IT HERE. POSITIONS = 15,000 SHARES AT $2.4

[my positions](https://preview.redd.it/lbvq40i68qh61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cf58e8c1e5e6ca656e77c765690de61bced53b2)

*don't know why my screenshot doesn't show on reddit, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/2YvrkR0 

&#x200B;

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

&#x200B;

Some share prices for your pleasure and education:

*again, the chart I uploaded to reddit doesn't show up on my end, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/VwK58BR 

**Highlights:**

Mar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Jan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Dec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

March 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

Aug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)

Sept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)

* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&#x200B;

* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)

*The image I uploaded may not show up. Another link:*  https://imgur.com/WARXMTh 

It appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.

**Competition:**

2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.

Non-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.

Current (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.

**Ops:**

2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.

26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.

A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e](https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e)

*The original image uploaded doesn't seem to show up, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/Gx9Ded6 

It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.

*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*

Now, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.

**Capex:**

Between 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.

Capital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.

It appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.

**Debt:**

2019 = $4.8bn

2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.

**Comparables:**

Price to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:

AMC -0.26 / 1.16

MSGE 0.85 / 0.63

CNK 2.41 / 3.12

IMAX 3.34 / 3.54

AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.

&#x200B;

# Mementals:

**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**

If we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.

What I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:

\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.

\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.

\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.

\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.

\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.

\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.

\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.

\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.

\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.

I believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.

&#x200B;

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

516,Winning SPAC DD #2: Mudrick Capital Acquisition (MUDSW) and merger speculation,"# Intro

The purpose of this DD is to bring light to Jason Mudrick's 2^(nd) SPAC with $250 Million Dollar in trust value and warrants (MUDSW) are currently at 1.15 while commons (MUDS) are trading at just 7 cents above its true NAV^(1) of $10.15.

Mudrick Capital Management (*run by Jason Mudrick*) has made several bets on distressed assets *with deep value* and has went from $5 Million in 2009 to over $2.8 Billion in 2021 (*560x growth, CAGR of 70% for 12 years straight*). Before I share more, please know that I'm just presenting what I found while doing my DD on them and why I believe this would be a winning SPAC for the long term. Irrespective of everything, I urge you to do your own DD as well. As a way of disclaimer, I have \~25,000 warrants (NASDAQ: MUDSW) with no plans to sell them.

# Management

Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corp II is run by **Jason Mudrick** who has had great success in identifying distressed assets with deep hidden value. He attended Harvard Law School and UofChicago. He started his career in 2000 with Merrill Lynch in their M&A Investment Banking group. He soon joined Contrarian Capital Management as Managing Director and Portfolio manager (current AUM: $6 Billion).

He has so far dedicated his entire life towards distressed capital and it would be fair to assume that finding a winning deal for this SPAC would be no different. I'm also inclined to say that he may already have a deal waiting to be announced. Purely because of his network, reputation in business, and resources that he possesses. Take that with a pinch of salt because distressed assets tend to be risky but the ones found by Mudrick so far have had deep-deep value and may not reflect full potential for a year or two. I would personally buy into anything that's chosen by a guy that has had so much success in this sector - a rare find to be honest.

You wouldn't believe but this is the guy who made 12% return on $2.8+ Billion dollar purely with his outlook on certain shorted companies and that includes AMC.

>*The fund’s returns were driven in part by a CMBX 6 short bet, and it also made money on investments in Gogo Inc., Ligado Networks LLC, and* ***AMC Entertainment*** *Holdings* *Inc. The hedge fund recently committed to lending $100 million to the world’s largest movie theater chain. Mudrick also sold its position in cxLoyalty Group Holdings Inc. to JPMorgan Chase & Co. for a profit.* [Link to Article](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/credit-funds-from-apollo-to-diameter-tally-big-gains-for-2020)

To add more to his already long-list of successful investments, let's not forget that Fortune Magazine named him the ""Best Traders of Wall Street"" in 2011 [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20120421054950/http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/12/12/best-worst-wall-street-traders/). On top of that, Institutional Investor named him the ""Rising Stars of Hedge Fund"" in 2010 [Source](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150qg1lm03n41/jason-mudrick?ArticleId=2595278).

There's a lot more to talk about Jason Mudrick and his excellent investments over the years but now let's talk about other key players in MUDS.

**Victor Danh** has a very similar career graph to Jason. Victor, just like Jason, went to Harvard and graduated with a degree in economics. He then joined Merrill Lynch, then UBS, then Contrarian Capital, and finally joined Mudrick Capital Management with Jason. It would be fair to assume that they are close friends and they can both bring winning deals to MUDS.

Victor also serves on the board of Seventy Seven Energy *(a company that essentially sells services & equipments to companies that are into land-based exploration of fuels and other gas related products).* Seventy Seven Energy more or less reminds me of Levi Strauss and Samuel Brannan who sold pickaxes during the gold rush and made way more money than any of the miners.

Victor is also on the board of Expanse Energy Solutions that specialized in selling Industrial grade electrical equipments.  Jason Mudrick's 1^(st) SPAC made Victor the Vice President of Hycroft Mining Holding Corp (NASDAQ: HYMC). This brings me to my next big topic of why retail traders don't understand how distressed capital works and why there's so much potential:

Don't be fooled by looking up the price of HYMC and thinking Mudrick's first SPAC is underperforming NAV so MUDS must follow the same suit. No! HYMC has 86.2% ownership by institutional investors ([source](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hymc/institutional-holdings)) and all of them are mostly interested in the **deep value** that HYMC has to offer i.e. ""HYMC owns one of the largest gold and silver deposits in the world with a unique low cost & low capital process with a 34 year mine life"" ([source](http://www.hycroftmining.com)). In fact, there's a ""STRONG BUY"" rating from analyst on HYMC ([source](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hymc/analyst-research)).

All of the retail traders, trading just 14% of the outstanding shares have single handedly brought down the stock price of HYMC. However, this will change within a year or two. People look at distressed capital and instantly think of a bad business but in reality it could just be bad times or something completely out of that company's influence. However, a distressed capital presents a unique opportunity to buy into a great business at a dirt cheap price. You know GME and the recent GME buying spree? Yeah Mudrick made over $100 Million in that ([source](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qfm3mlgbty1v/Hedge-Funds-Always-Win)). You can see names like BlackRock, Vanguard, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and 30 other well known name who have a good chunk of HYMC, totaling up to 86.2%! 35 institutional firms can't be wrong about a deep value distressed assets but 14% of retail traders panic and dip. Here's how HYMC is going to play out and it's very simple: as soon as there's an uptick in net profits generated by HYMC, everyone's going to rush and buy HYMC which will cause its stock to soar given 86% of it is very likely to not be traded.

I can write a longer DD on HYMC alone but that's not the point of this MUDS DD. EvenLet me know in comment section if you want that, but it would be fair to assume right now that HYMC is grossly undervalued and doesn't represent true performance. Now let's talk about the next key important person Scott Kasen in MUDS.

**Scott Kasen** is the guy who has all the political connections to make things happen, legally. He is the Vice President in the Trump Organization and his proximity with other political leaders would be undeniable. Scott used to be a portfolio manager at Contrarian Capital and that explains his close network with Jason and Victor. There's more to talk about him but without making this DD too long, let me quickly cover the last person of interest.

**Dr. Brian Kushner** is the senior managing director of FTI (NYSE: FCN) and their stocks have been making all time highs pretty much all the time. This guy is an all rounder, he started off with Ford Motor company, went into Radio & music business, got into Thryv (NASDAQ: THRY) which is a marketing company and their stock are always making all-time-highs. He is also on the board of Luxfer Holdings (NYSE: LXFR) which is specialty materials manufacturing company. The prospectus says "" \[Dr. Brian Kushner has\] extensive network of contacts in both private equity, hedge funds and distressed investing"". Truly an all rounder guy that's almost into everything.

# Piecing all of this together

The 4 people mentioned above are of key interest. I have taken a look at their previous investments, their network and all of it points towards one thing i.e. **they are most likely to merge with an healthcare or a real-estate company.** All of those 4 people have previous history of investing in distressed companies in that sector and it wouldn't be a surprise if MUDS merge with one of the companies from that sector. There was an article in early 2020 where Mudrick said that Malls are in decline and they are one of the biggest value holders when it comes to real estate -- and people often overlook that. He criticized the existence of malls, how badly they are run, and investors often think of malls from a landlord's perspective instead of the tenant. Building on top of this will show that they are very likely to bring public a company that has a lot to do with real-estate, specifically malls, and how he might be able to scoop them up for a cheap rate given most of them are soon going to be distressed because of increasing defaults due to coronavirus pandemic.

Let's not forget that Jason Mudrick bet heavy on AMC & GME before the frenzy even started and it made him well over $200 Million ([source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687)). This guy has made so many risky bets and it has always turned out golden for him (*and the investors*).

**tl;dr: I've talked about the management in order to draw a conclusive judgement on what kinda company MUDS could be merging with. Healthcare and real-estate are both a great business to be in if it's available at a great price. Also the business sector I think MUDS will merge with. Feel free to leave a constructive feedback and how I can improve my future DDs. I personally have \~25,000 warrants of MUDSW entirely because I trust Jason Mudrick's judgement and I will not be selling them anytime soon.**

**How to buy:** You can either buy the common (MUDS) at $10.22 per share or you can get yourself warrants at $1.15 (MUDSW). The warrants are 1:1 (*meaning you get 1 common share for 1 warrant which is great deal*). I personally only have warrants because of the greater return they bring.

2. SOS: Gapping up on momentum from the last couple days of trading. Good volume in the premarket, with premarket resistance around 10.28-10.29.
3. TRCH: Gapping up on a news catalyst. Seeing good volume and price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance is at 3.99, with support near 3.50.
4. DFFN: Gapping up on COVID-related news catalyst. Seeing good volume and decent price action in the premarket. 
5. FTFT: Gapping up on momentum from Friday. Seeing decent volume and price action in the premarket. Just be patient for a setup and don't go chasing trades. 
6. AREC: Gapping up on a news catalyst. Seeing good volume and decent price action in the premarket. 
7. MYT: Gapping up on momentum from the past few days of trading. Looks a bit extended here, so just be cautious and make sure you aren't chasing a trade. Also very low float, so could see volatile swings this morning. 
8. AMC: Gapping up without a catalyst. I'll be watching AMC, but just tread lightly.

Overall market looks like it will open in the green this morning. Lots of small caps gapping up this morning to choose from, so patience is key. Don't trade just to trade, be picky. Weed stocks looking to open in the green, and I'll be watching them. Lithium-related stocks also seeing some strength this morning. Crypto-related plays are also doing well in premarket, as Bitcoin broke over 50,000 for the first time. Volatility is very low, which makes me feel a bit uneasy as well. Make sure you don't chase trades, it is very important to set aside the emotions that come with FOMO. It might be a good idea to run the screener again a few times as the morning goes on. Also, have an exit strategy with any trade you take, whether it is to take profits, or to stop yourself out for a loss.

Remember to use proper risk management, and make sure you size appropriately for your account. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-02-16 08:32:58
518,BDRBF going to DaMoon,"If ur like me you loved playing with Planes & Trains, the BDRBF is for you! - Amazing long term opp 
 Get your lines in early sub1$  - No buying limit on robinhood -  get your lines and share the good word

********TLDR: DD - Don’t let the low share price or recent struggles fool you, Bombardier is set for an amazing bounce back as they raise billions in capital to increase production capabilities to fulfill their BILLIONS in back orders*******


This is going to be a bit long but I don’t think you want your DD’s to be short. TLDR at the bottom.
Just a little background. BDRBF, or Bombardier, is one of 4 major airlines manufacturers in the world. Boeing and Airbus make the big planes, Bombardier and Embraer make the smaller planes (think private planes). Okay so a lot of people have been looking at COVID recovery stokes and as a result hotel stocks like MGM are already trading at 90% of their precovid levels (having recovered from a ~75% fall) and I won’t even get started on things like AMC. Most of the potential COVID recoviery plays are priced as if covid is almost gone, when the reality is things won’t return to ‘normal’ for at least 6 months. But then we have BDRBF, it’s still sitting at less than half of it’s pre covid numbers, and here are 9 reasons it’s massively underpriced and the stock price is likely going to the stratosphere alongside the planes they make.

-First and probably most important, it’s undervalued compared to its competitors. Boeing and Airbus both have EPS (earnings per share) of -8, and Embraer an EPS of -22. Obviously these numbers aren’t good but what can you expect from a plane manufacturer during a global pandemic/ Meanwhile Bombardier’s EPS is only -1, much cheaper than its competitors. EPS obviously isn’t the perfect number for comparisons with different share prices and different number of shares but the 3 competitors have all had 4 quarters in a row of negative earnings, BDRBF is the only to have one positive earning quarter, and it is the most recent quarter (signaling their return to profitability). And if you look up the earnings misses/beats and earnings/revenue for the 4 companies BDRBF is the strongest. Part of this is because the private jet sector has been less impacted than the public aviation sector as discussed below.


-BDRBF has around 8-9 billions dollars in debt. Yea i know this is bad, but let me tell you why it’s actually not. The large amount of debt they have compared to their 1.5 bill market cap might seem bad, and it’s a big reason the stock has stayed depressed for years, but after this week their debt will be cut in half as they sell off their train division for ~4.5 billion, cutting their debt in half. On top of this they have $12 billion dollars of back orders. That means with the new capital they have coming in from the sale they can significantly reduce debt and have cash to expand their production capabilities to meet their backorder demand (which they are doing)


BDRBF is Canada’s version of too big too fail. Although they are not at risk of bankruptcy, if they ever get in trouble Canada will likely bail them out (as they have done in the past). BDRBF is a very large company in Canada and has international footing.

Short volume is at 39%. While this isn’t too important, it’s a possible benefit with all of the short busting that’s been going on, and a potential for an immediate boost as hedge funds have been trimming their shorts across the market.

They’ve been cutting their less profitable divisions for years and after the sale of their train division, will be left with their high end jet travel division. These are the $70-100 million dollar private jets that have good margin and are (and have been) less susceptible to market turndowns. For example, covid decreased high end private jet orders only half as much as they decreased plane orders overal. The rich really aren’t affected by this stock as much as normal aviation travel has been.

BDRBF has entered into partnerships with companies like MHI which have transferred the risk of maintenance of aircraft to them, while still allowing BDRBF to supply the parts for those repairs. This derisks the company so you won’t have to worry about 1 plane crash tanking the stock like what sometimes happens with airline stocks.

Revenue from the business aircraft activities (the division they are focusing on as they’ve sold off their other divisions) actually grew 10% last year.

The volume of shares traded is at an all time high. This is something we see a lot with turn around stocks as people flood to but the stock before a sudden and sharp rise in price.

After a rush to buy pre owned jets in Q4 of 2020, pre-owned jet inventory has dropped to just 8% this month, the lowest number in more than 2 decades. An unavailability of pre-owned jets does (and has in the past) pushed/forced people to buy new jets, which will lead to more business for BDRBF.",2021-02-16 10:19:22

522,Blackberry: Bear Case,"The more in look into Blackberry and Connected Cars and Unified Endpoint Management the ***more bullish I get on BB***, on top of that Reddit is filled with CONSTANT confirmation bias. To ground myself I wrote a bear case, please help me add to it, ***the stronger we can make the bear case, the more clear we will see the potential opportunity*****.** 

# Macro: 

Ivy will not be released till 2023, developers are not expected to get access till 2022 **Far too early to expect Ivy to benefit BB’s bottom line.** Without it, stock price will not moon.

**Collaboration/partnerships** with 3rd parties (AWS, Biadu, IBM, Hyundai via Motional, Microsoft (crisis management/Microsoft Teams)) to develop technologies, products and services  **may not result in ROI**

Some OEMS and tier 1 customer have accelerated **internal development of embedded solutions** could result in fewer customer orders, loss of market share, pressure to reduce prices, etc

COVID-19 Impact, Chip storage hitting the automobile sector resulting in revenue decrease of 16% in Q3 FY21, **could continue into the future**

**Market is highly competitive**:  IBM, Microsoft, VMware, Mobile Iron, CrowdStrike to name a few

Technology landscape: **evolving customer requirements, high frequency of product introductions by competitors** could leave BB behind

Maintaining key personal: success is dependent on ability to develop/retain skilled employees (executive team, R&amp;D team, experience sales people with specialized knowledge). Competition is intense, has resulted in **solicitation** resulting in higher compensation costs not offset by higher prices

Changes in endpoints, operating systems and applications, security threats and industry standards 

Must obtain/maintain certain product approvals and certifications from government bodies and regulated enterprise customers, although BB is already ISO26262 certified (auto industry)

BBs software runs on \*3rd party operating systems\* (Apple, Google, Microsoft, OEM op systems). **Updates to these op system with limited notice can disrupt operations**, forcing company to divert resources from preexisting product roadmap to accommodate changes 

Meeting debenture covenants

# Financials

Revenues have stalled, **growth is challenged** based on current financials

**BB** (4%) **trails the average revenue when compared to competitors** **in each space** in Enterprise Software (5%) , Licensing &amp; IP (10%), Cybersecurity (10%), Canadian Enterprise Software (9%) per TD Securities equity research

Normalized operating expenses have fluctuated although below average for last 8 qtrs

**Hasn’t reported a profitable qtr since Q4 FY19** (Feb 2019)

Let me know if I missed anything.

Currently holding ~400 shares @ $12, I started buying last week, before WSB happened

**Edit**
New points added from the discussion below and my observation..
 
**Perception: Many retail investors still consider BB a smartphone maker**, John Chen and the BB marketing team need to rebrand to change this perception. Other than their PR releases and twitter, I don’t see much else..i could be wrong..  **Although BB deals with B2B not B2C**, specifically they are niche with OEMs, governments, banks and healthcare.  One could argue no marketing is needed as a result, the security industry is well aware of the best products.
 
WSBs: I’ve been active in the BB community for 2 weeks now, and **ALOT of people are bag holding, ALOT, which is why I believe your seeing so many pumps**, granted BB has been killing it with their constant updates with partnerships..not sure what came first but someone had posted a chart showing the correlation between BB, GME, AMC, and they are moving in sync!
 
BB Cylance (AI and machine learning-based cybersecurity solutions) **was trending down from 20% of revenue in FY20 Q1 to 10% by the end of the FY.  Since then, BB stopped breaking out revenue between IoT and Cylance and now present it as one (Software &amp; Service)**",2021-02-17 22:43:59

524,"Yesterday's play was absolutely amazing, while others lost, I hope you took advantage and made money! Lets go with momentum! 9 plays in 9 days and all profitable!","The title speaks for itself. After 9 days of 9 plays, where every single trade made money, I still get people that thing I am a bot, a shill, I do pump and dumps. First of all this is a forum, I would say majority of people read threads for ideas, opinions, information, and the vast majority actually want plays that make sense. Also, no I do not work for a hedge fund, I am not paid to talk down GME AMC NIO or TSLA. In all honesty, a hedge fund or analyst would not pay me to post, why? Because you know what, I will work for a fund or analyst, however my price tag is $500,000 annually with benefits as well. Or, if I am a portfolio manager a salary is not needed, I want 1% of the portfolio assets and .05% for everything above 10% of the portfolio. That is actually cheap for top money managers... and I am actually somewhat serious....I am posting on these boards because I am not able to post on Bets yet (9 million members) I do hope that if and when I do I open eyes and if a manager, Ray Dalio, Carl Icahn, David Tepper, has someone that he pays to troll, let me know those are my demands... I say this because after 9 days of different and daily plays I get these messages. Are you even reading the plays and notice every single play has made money? Listen, I do have a motive, it is to make money, and I hope everyone else makes money if they choose to take action. I do not pump and dump! These are not shill companies like NIO! Printing shares every few months for cash...

Also, remember I am giving you daily plays with no compensation and no expectation of compensation. I am not telling anyone what to do or giving investment advice. I am giving everyone insight on a day trader and giving free access to daily trades. That said, please check the track record since the very first post 2/8/2021 

This is not a game for me, it is real money, and it should not be for you. I find it sad that on BETS they glorify losses and laugh... This isnt funny and if you agenda isnt to make money you can read my posts with a grain of salt, take in the amusement laugh if you will. I have been trading since about 15 and from the year 1995. Trades were over the phone and $50 a trade! I started with about $2,000. If the nasdaq didnt crash in March of 2000, who knows, I could be butting heads with Dalio, Tepper, Griffin. The nasdaq as a whole was down 83% in 2000. I was down 70%. What I most learned from this was not to buy in shill companies. We have all made mistakes, it is what we learn from them. With this crash and being about 20, I isolated myself and no longer had the ambition to be a money manager.. but who knows I may come out from the shadows if this really brings me a draw. Now the point of this paragraph is last night I was going back and forth with someone over the company Sea Limited, stock symbol SE. I tried to give kinda advice and suggest selling half, take some profits and it began to spin into an argument. Listen, no company should trade at 135 billion with no earnings. None, end of story. I dont need to hear rhetoric from any CEO, CFO or the company's overview and pipe dreams. I am not here to wait 3-5 years and hope you arent either. That said, I do like SE, and I suggested that if this company pulls back to 75, I will trade it again, it is now at 275. You can't imagine what this caused. I make money on what is happening now, maybe, maybe 52 weeks out, but dont tell me about 3-5 years, sorry I dont want to hear it. 

My plays make you money today, tomorrow within a few days. Sorry they dont go to the moon, but every single play was a money maker. Yes, I can stock pick even for 1 year out...but I will not pay a premium for a stock now, where the evaluation may materialize in 3-5 years. Sorry TSLA lovers. Telling you the truth!

Now back to what we are here for

Yesterday for us was awesome. I traded PLTR 3 rounds (buy and sell), 50 cents each round. I also bought it back at 25 and still own it. I will sell again for 50 cents or more

Tuesday - RKT, awesome yesterday I also cashed out at 20.30. I was in 20.25, 19.90 and 19.75. I completely cashed out will buy again. For those of you that dont understand why I dont generally do long term plays please refer to my original post Tuesday morning on RKT. I explain it in detail

Wednesday - NOK, I cashed out yesterday at 4.12, the news was good and I will buy back again at 4.05 if I can... also I cashed out for other opportunities. Yes I do make more trades then I highlight here, however, I am giving plays for free with no expectation for compensation so why give ever trade? 

Wednesday Bonus - ALL, I still own it at 105.50 and 105.75, remember I did cash out my shares from 104.20 at 105

Thursday PLTR - 24.75 to 25.25, 25.50x 2, Back in at 25, yes, with super luck, it is much higher in the pre market and I may sell half at 8am.

Todays play

CLOV - Yes their is alot of controversy with CLOV, spacs, the short report and honestly I am not at all a fan of Chamath (SPCE) is 1 of the biggest shill companies but we arent here about that. CLOV is actually a real insurance company and because it is new it hasnt reported. That said, generally I do not like to buy IPO's or new company's until at least 1 report. Full disclosure I have traded CLOV ever since the report around 12 and such. Even last few days. Tomorrow I am hoping I get start an entry and 10.50 or if I must 10.65-10.75. My objective 25-50 cents. if you want to hold this longer it is probably a safe trade to 12. But their is going to be alot of turbulence as their is a cloud over this and remember I am mainly a day trader, sometimes a swing trader

Good luck everyone and lets make MONEY! The motive is I want everyone to make money, if you have another agenda... you just read posts and dont want to make money... Good luck to you too!",2021-02-19 07:35:56
525,I'm trying to understand Robinhood's excuse/exposure risk,"On January 27th, Robinhood closed down the purchasing of GME and AMC because of ""market volatility."" They sent an e-mail on the 28th confirming it saying that the market volatility increased the deposit requirements of those stocks.

Yesterday, at the congressional hearings, they doubled down on that rationale, calling it a ""five-sigma event,” or a one in three-and-a-half-million occurrence.

I'm not arguing to determine whether Robinhood was being truthful here. I'm not trying to argue against their logic. I'm not trying to understand it.

Say you have $350 in your account on January 27. You want to buy one share of GME at $350. Now, two things can happen

1) They find no one willing to sell at $350 and your stock order remains unfulfilled.

2) They find someone willing to sell at $350. They take $350 out of your account. They buy the stock. They give you the stock.

&#x200B;

Isn't this what happens with any stock purchase? Am I being too simplistic? Am I just wrong in what's going on? What risk is there to Robinhood? How does market volatility play into a requirement for increased deposits?",2021-02-19 14:05:13
526,"Why am I not satisfied, why is greed a thing.","Hello all, have invested a total of $17,000 into the stock market from the beginning of January 2020 until now. At the start of GME movement I was at $31,000. After GME was over I finished with a total of $84,000 and felt depressed because I could've sold when it was $105,000 but I was greedy. Not only that, but soon after I spent $10,000 on a very stupid AMC play. Then a very stupid play (Lucid) which I will not mention that got me down to $66,000. With that $66,000. I have $20,000 sitting in NIO and $10,000 in ARKF.

Mind you I make only $29,000 salary after tax right now so it would've meant so much to cash out at $105,000. This is all tax free account for those concerned",2021-02-19 17:34:29
527,The 99.2% AMC stock being held statement is FALSE. Here's why,"EDIT: I'm am 100% for this stock to go up. **I like the stock**. If you think I want it to go down, you might be illiterate. I simply am clarifying definitions.

&#x200B;

To start - I have several hundred shares of AMC from before the whole blow up of GME + AMC. So call me a shill and I'll John Travolta meme at your comment.

Do I think AMC price will go up eventually? Yes, absolutely.

&#x200B;

If you think that 99.2% of AMC stock is held, you're wrong. Look at Disney. It's at 99.9%. Does that mean that only 0.1% of people are selling Disney? Is Disney gonna moon to $1000 all of a sudden? NO. You need to LEARN about what these values mean. Let's explain why none of what you're believing is true.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r00crx1w1oi61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8494c5117a72d43681b7b6fb06b69d11d09f14e9

Look, I get it. Some of you are well versed in stocks and just freshly made a Reddit account. Some of you are new to the world of stocks in general. And some of you just can't fucking spell correctly in your titles. You heard the hype and joined in for the fun or possibility of profit. Well, educating yourself is the best thing you can do. The last thing you wish to become is sheep, following what others say without being able to understand if what they say is true or false.

&#x200B;

Let's begin:

The main example today - the bullshit 99.2% of **all** AMC shares being held.

Wow, do you fucking hear yourselves? Does that sound even remotely like it makes any sense? You truly believe that out of the entire world, 99.2% of all people that own AMC stock are simply holding it? For one moment, try to remember that Reddit is not the world. There are, as impossible as you might think, people that own AMC stock that are not part of this subreddit or any others. Think of all the automated algorithms that day trade vast quantities. All of them only amount to 0.8%?

""But I saw 99.2% on some screenshot of some website!""

You sure did. But did you know what that 99.2% was actually indicating? No, of course not. It's a far more blissful experience to see the number, hear some fuckwit tell you it's gonna moon **based on that**, and then you post 💎🙌 and scratch your head why it didn't happen a week later.

&#x200B;

Here's what it actually indicates: there's a 99.2% ratio of the **float shares** to the **outstanding shares**.

What does that mean? Well, like half the posts in [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/), it's really fucking simple to Google. Here's an extremely dumbed down version:

&#x200B;

Outstanding Shares: all the shares of the company including **institutional** shares + **restricted** shares

Institutional Shares: shares that other companies hold in that stock.

Restricted Shares: shares potentially for employees. You as a retail investor don't have access to these.

Float Shares: all the shares minus the **restricted** shares. This is also called the **PUBLIC** float because it's the amount of shares that are available on any given day for the public to trade with.

&#x200B;

Sooo, using words instead of numbers for some quick algebra, what have we concluded?

Float / Outstanding shares simply means all of the AMC shares that are available to the public. 99.2% of all the shares (outstanding share) of AMC are available for the public to purchase (float share). This percentage is BASED ON some website's analysis and the actual numbers will of course be different depending of what website you look at because no one actually has the precise number.

&#x200B;

TLDR: The 99.2% of all amc shares being held statement is FALSE. I still believe amc shares will go up, but this number is not what you think it means.",2021-02-20 12:19:37
528,The whole GME/AMC trend completely derailed my plans and strategy.,"I had such a good year, up over 100%. Had a solid strategy that was making me gains that I was proud of and I was steadily growing towards my goal. 

I made the worst mistake jumping on the AMC trend and it shattered my portfolio. Pretty much what I deserve from following the trend and deviating from my strategy, but it’s demoralizing to say the least. My portfolio went from up 110% to down 50%, so I’ve lost half my original investment. 

Since then, I can’t seem to do anything correct to get back green. Each day I’m losing more and getting more discouraged. 

Any advice from people who have been in a similar situation, lost a bunch of gains and are currently negative? 

It took me like 6 months to get over that “FOMO” mindset. The second I followed it again, I pretty much lost it all. 

Just looking for any suggestions or advice on what I should do. Should I pull my money out for now until I get over this discouraged feeling? Should I just keep trying? 

Thanks in advance.",2021-02-22 15:36:06

It is to bad I didn't have enough time to pick up any of the hedges we were discussing yesterday! I'll be looking more into some for the QQQ, SPY and DIA.

The tech sector took a hard hit today with the DOW managing a small gain. The rising inflation and bond yields were eventually going to get priced in; there was little doubt it would not. Also, the Biden stimulus was finally confirmed but that more benefitted the DOW than tech. 

There is nothing that I would like to add to the watchlist today as I prefer to dollar cost average my bigger positions on days like today, especially tech. Tomorrow let's see if we see a small bounce back and if we do, I don't expect this week to finish out green for tech.

$**CCIV**: This is another on that is coming up to my support. The deal with Lucid was confirmed, however it sent the stock plummeting.

$**NNDM**: Nano Dimensions, the Israeli 3-D printing play, is approaching the lower, stronger support. I've got a buy order for commons at $12 GTC, so hoping I'll be able to lower my cost basis a little bit.

The people on the forums, had their vote, there is  no need for me to wait a week, in just 1 day the reception of positive  by far outweighed any negatives, and for the Stock forum with 2.3  million members that felt my posts were spam, I am sorry to lose 2.3  million eye balls.   
 

 

**You can skip this  next paragraph and if you do not care about the thesis of why we may  want to go defensive. NEW traders should read this and don't be offended  think about why this is mentioned**  
 

 

Ok back to the task at hand. There are no if and's  about it, speculation and inflation have hit the markets. Historically  the SP trades at about 22x PE (Which means the average stock on the 500  Index trades at 22x what is made per share), at the moment with the  lovely inclusion of TSLA it is about 40. Yes, there are many other  indexes but this is widely regarded as the most important one. I read  many posts, and concerns about a correction, crash etc. I will say I do  not believe their will be a crash but a correction 10% dip off the top of the  SP is absolutely possible. How did this happen and why do I say that?  In my 26 years of trading I have never seen the market come off so hard  (Down 30% last March/April) and bounce back to record highs in months,  never! It can take 2-3 years. I contribute this to 0 commissions,  pandemic everyone at home, people can't go to casinos, easy access to  money/stimulus, GME AMC mania everyone wants to be rich quick. I am very  sorry to call out alot of new traders, I like to see people get  interested in the market and come in with open hands and want to learn. I  say welcome to the show. However I do not like the questions that are  constantly asked..... So, I am new to this, how long will it take me to  make 100,000 with 5,000.....I am thinking of quitting my job what do you  think......What stock would be good to take my life savings.... What is  the next GME/AMC......  
 

There is an old saying on Wall st.,if your barber  starts giving you stock picks, when your shoe shine person says to buy  bitcoin, usually that is a signal to be alert.   
 

When I have brand new traders trying to convince me  why NIO is worth $100, (43,000 cars sold in 2020, 7,000 cars sold in  January, Market CAP 90 Billion) while GM (8 Million cars sold 2020,  nearly 1 Million sold in January, Market CAP 70 Billion) something is  definitely wrong. Listen I love enthusiasm and I love new traders but  this is not a game or casino. I have traded 26 years and I still have a  W2, yes I do well, and trading has allowed me to have a business and own  rental property but I still have a W2, at least for 5 more years. You  should not treat this as a game and I recommend Index funds if you have a  small amount and do not want to day trade. Why not a mutual fund or  high flying ETF like ARK (Cathie Wood is a god!!) Because index funds  have the lowest fees and over time they return close to 8% without hefty  management fees/admin fees, the expense ratio isnt the only thing you  look at! Wait what? You mentioned Cathie Wood isnt a god? You don't like  ARK funds??? No, she has done well but ARK has been around for 6  years and before 2020 (When she was indeed hot) returned about 10%  annualized, which is good but doesnt cause someone like me to say she is  a rockstar, so you know her funds were down 9% yesterday, check the  facts. I mention this because her holdings are horrifying. Stocks that  did well have have insane PE's, SHOP (I like but last traded at 600), ZM  (I like but last traded under 200), SPOT (I never liked since IPO),  TSLA (You don't even want me to start), if she rotates who knows, but  all these stocks you are paying a very high premium for something that  may, or may not happen. So index funds it is! Now if you own these  stocks and your outlook is 1+ years and you want to call me names, thats  fine, they very well can be good plays long term, but for me I don't  pay premiums for anything past 52 weeks. Good luck if you do. So to sum  it up, the market is indeed frothy and don't quit your job if you are  new to this....index funds if you are going to be passive.

 

Now, yesterday my play was LDI, but if you read my  thesis and idea, I was going in at 22, some of you did or lower and made  a profit, kudos. I got in 1,000 shares (remember I still have 1,000 at  23.20 which I decided to hold Friday) I sold 500 shares at 22.25 but I  am still holding 500 from 22, 1000 from 23.20. Now I did get some  messages about this so I will go over this briefly. Please remember this  is not financial advice this is a play by play of an experienced day  trader. I am sorry if you read my post and wanted to go rogue and jump  in at the open, my post did say I was waiting for a pullback of 22. I  also mentioned clearly, remember these posts come out at 8am that there  is a chance we may need to go defensive if the market is red. That said,  lets look at LDI for people that think I steered them wrong.

RKT which I love reports Thursday and may also show a light on this sector, it is regarded as the industry leader.

The most important thig is this, so I will put it in bold, and is why I am not concerned at all about LDI.

 

**LDI as a whole has a  market cap of 1.3 billion (The company is worth 1.3 Billion) LDI last earned in profit last quarter was 547 million!!!!!! So the market values the entire company  for 1/3rd of what they made in just 3 months!! YES! Market isnt very  smart so I take advantage**  
 

 

That is not a typo, check the report. I am a day  trader but I tell you, if you got in at 23 you should have no concern. I  have 1,000 at 23.20 I am not worried, if you got in at 26 weeks ago, I  got a message like this, you should not be concerned and yes you can  average down and ""buy the dip"" Why? BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTALS SAY SO!!  NO, THIS ISNT GME OR AMC dont throw your life savings and average down  every pay check. LDI and RKT are absolute gold mines because they are  cash cows, how 33% of RKT is short absolutely blows my mind. Well,  Ultimate why are people so negative on RKT why is it short, how come  analysts hate it, exactly give me their job and pay me what I am worth!   
 

RKT will prove this again thursday and I will definitely trade it if it goes down to 20...I cashed out last week.

 

If you went defensive yesterday on ALL, you did  great it dipped under 103 and went as high as 106.27. I exited and  cashed out at 106 and 106.15.... Now this doesnt mean I am not bullish  and won't trade back in, I will look to trade again maybe at 104....if  it goes but that doesn't mean it will, no one controls the market.

 

So recap yesterday

LDI - In at 22 sold half 22.25 still own half at 22 (Also have shares at 23.20)

 

ALL - Cashed out yesterday at 106 and 106.15, Will look to buy on a pullback

 

Today will also have 1 defensive play in case the market is red... I am posting this about 7:30 AM

 

**RXT Rackspace**  
 

RXT reported last week and the report was mediocre  but got hammered on that report down over 20%.... Now some people will  say what are you doing to us, a company with bad earnings? No, this  wasnt the FSLY report or BA (1 of the top 5 worst ive seen in 26 years),  I said this report was mediocre. The company revised estimates to 95  cents to 1.05 slightly below 1.11 estimate. No this isnt good but the  stock was hammered and will have a below 20 or close PE. Remember before  how I said the SP trades at 22 and now near 40? This is way over done,  also RXT has been in business forever and just IPO'ed again, the company  that originally bought it years ago paid 4.4 Billion and now its at 4.2  Billion and the company is profitable.. So whats my plan.

 

Im looking to first enter on a dip maybe 19.75 to 20 but have to see what the market says at 9:30, I wont chase it I  will wait at least 5 minutes after 9:30 which is what I call the shake  out. I will look to sell at 2 different prices 25 cents to 1 dollar...  Thats my plan

 

**If we must go defensive**

 

**CAH Cardinal Health**

When the market corrects from previous history,  usually big money moves out of high tech and starts flooding to low PE,  Dividend stocks with -Beta. CAH trades at 7-8x PE has a 4% dividend and  is in healthcare. I have also been trading this back and forth because  the market just hates it!

 

I actually just cashed out days ago at 52.40.... I  am looking again if it dips and hoping to get in at 51 to 51.50 and  trade this for 75 cents to a dollar... Thats my plan

 

GOOD LUCK EVERYONE! Now remember this isnt me  telling you what to do, I am not getting compensated, please do not  blame me, these are trades I am about to make. If you do decide....

537,Can someone explain to me why halting trading of a stock is not market manipulation?,"What the title said. How is halting a stock, whether it is going up or down aggressively, not market manipulation? Is it really a free and open market if anyone (the exchanges) has the power to do this? It seems to me that there should be no central control of a ""free"" market and the right to cease trading should not be held by any party whatsoever.

It is everyone's personal responsibility to take on the risks of the market and that includes volatility. I feel like a lot of the time these things are done under the guise of what is ""in the best interest of retail investors"" but in reality, it does nothing but make them powerless to either buy or sell super volatile securities (get out or get in at their will). I didn't touch GME, AMC, or any of those wsb stocks with a ten-foot pole because I knew the risks, but just because some people didn't do their due diligence and may get burnt doesn't mean a stock should get halted. That is simply the nature of an open market, no?

If you don't want to experience such volatility then one should do their research and either not get involved in the stock market or not buy securities that are known to be volatile. Halting the market or the trading of any specific security is quite the opposite of a free and open capitalist marketplace. I don't buy any of the ""halts are used to make the market safer"" narrative. That is not a free and open marketplace then. Plain and simple. 

Am I crazy for having this opinion? I wish there was a way to create an autonomous marketplace that is not under the control of any party and runs freely. It seems to me the free market really isn't free or transparent at all.",2021-02-24 18:12:51

539,GME Saga continues and my analysis,"Most people on an investing subreddit already know something is coming again. 

Today is going to be a very weird but nonetheless interesting day for the markets. I don't think it's going to play out 100% like January 27th/28th. Something different already is that if you look at the charts, GME starting taking off near the last 30 minutes and especially soared during after hours. What I suspect from this is that institutional investors such as Blackrock are going back in to the battlefront. Let's be real here, retail investors simply don't have as much volume as they think. My analogy for those who watch Attack on Titan is think of titans battling one another on GME with the human retail investors at the sidelines doing support and reconnaissance. Of course, we love a good story and there is definitely a David and Goliath narrative being pushed of retail investors taking down the hedge funds and Robinhood to spur momentum. Though having institutional investors on the long position is not a bad thing, in fact I'd argue that the one reason we have not seen Congress or the SEC take decisive action on this is because they know GME is a nuke that is ready to go off and it's better to just look at the aftermath. 

Which leaves a question, why would institutions short **again** after the shitshow last time, you'd think we taught those old folks a lesson? Well, GME was at $350 during the peak and held support at $90-100 for a while before dipping to $40-50. From a numbers and fundamentals perspective, it actually would be the correct move to short GME at $50-300 because in an ideal world (the efficient-market hypothesis, disclaimer: not an economics student lol), GME does not have the fundamentals to support a price of $50+. However, the funny thing about the stock market is that it's not simply fundamentals; emotions, hype, and feedback loops throw the market into chaos. What this means is that while hedge funds did make the correct move in shorting, particularly as a means to cover their previous positions, this plan could fall apart with enough sentiments.

My take is that we are seeing institutional and high frequency traders cannibalizing each other and GME became the battlefront of this showdown. However, I do find it funny that a lot of the other stocks like BB, AMC, NOK, KOSS, NAKD, BBBY that were a part of the hype back in January are also caught in this storm with their tickers showing a similar pattern. I'm guessing there were algorithms and crawlers that managed to catch up while other investors prepare for what is another frenzy in the stock market. Odds are high that we're going to see another red day in the market as the volatility creates more fear and institutional investors cut their losses by selling off their more lucrative long positions. To a lesser extent, there might be FOMO and retail investors, at least a few on WSB are selling off parts of their portfolio to jump on the train again. I do want to know what becomes of this.... what's going to happen with DFV, how will brokers and the SEC react, and what is the conclusion to this Gamestop saga.",2021-02-25 05:22:41
540,AMC GME difference – Not the short or Gamma Squeeze candidate you think it is – real short interest a lot lower due to massive share count increase and dilution.,"mportant discussion point on AMC - which I think is very different to GME.

There has been a lot of confusion about the amount of shares outstanding AMC has. The company issued a lot (c.350m shares recently) from its roughly 100m pre COVID count. When measuring total shares out on loan or short (which is roughly 48m) it is important to understand how big the free float actually is.

According to this SEC filing filed by AMC: (you can find all filings if you search AMC SEC):

[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/512648ea-ce75-4aef-8855-55b8d3fd9709.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/512648ea-ce75-4aef-8855-55b8d3fd9709.html)

The share count after the ATM program completed was: 365m (all float)

(Search the linked document for 356,498,711)

&#x200B;

This was before Sikverlake converted their convertible into an additional 44m of shares.

See filing here:

[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/eb4eda51-9031-49ee-ae23-abcef50a8152.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/eb4eda51-9031-49ee-ae23-abcef50a8152.html)

After that Wanda converted roughly 50m B shares into A shares to sell them off

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html)

**To summarize:**

**there is about 450m shares (365+44+50)=450 shares outstanding – and that is all float.**

**So its short interest about 10% of float.... market watch has the wrong shares outstanding and the 80% is purely wrong as they have a float of around 57m (which used to be the old A shares before they started issuing more stock)**

This are the official SEC filings – also AMC has a share authorisation for a further 500m shares… when the stock goes up they just turn up the dilution tap.

**Given the trading volume it takes a whopping 0.2-0.3 days to cover the short.. hardly critical and hardly heavy shorted. and 100m of options do not make the difference... that is another 0.2d**

**Fundamentally it’s a terrible company (not that fundamentals matter too much)**

\- AMC has never produced any FCF. It had 5bn of debt before COVID at relatively low interest payments.

\- Due to COVID they had to raise an additional 1200m of debt at high cost. The last 100m loan from Mudrich Capital charged 17!!! %

\- To stay alive they had to print stock at a rapid speed. Share count is not 4.5x pre COVID. It was trading below USD 10 pre covid.

\- Why would it trade above an implied USD 50 (at current share prices) Despite 1bn + extra debt?

**So this short term momentum squeeze might be very very short lived. Enjoy it while it lasts..**

Disclosure: I have no position in AMC

&#x200B;

EDIT: I feel sorry for all the newbies that are talked repeatedly into buying this stock and just loose all the money... without knowing the facts and that AMC is a total bag and due to the increased float all the story of a big squeeze is just a ferrytail ;)",2021-02-25 07:36:52

**Gap Downs:** ARKG, BBY, BUD, DPZ, GBT, NTAP, PING, PLUG, PZZA, TDOC, TSLA, 

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY sitting inside of yesterdays range after making a quick recovery back over all moving averages while the QQQ is sitting underneath it's 20 dma and 9 ema still struggling to recover as well. Airlines, Cruise lines and Casinos continue to run, weed stocks slowly trying to grind back higher and oil is still on fire. Trading action intraday remains nice. Great moves in both directions (short and long). Over 200 stocks reporting earnings since last night and a few of the charts look good.

I want to make a quick clarification and say that this post and list is geared towards day trading, and I am not advocating to blindly buy and hold these at all, in fact I advise strongly against that.

*With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5-10 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks. Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management.

**Large Cap Watchlist (*****over $10*****)**

* Gapping UP: GME, MARA, RIOT, WKHS, XL, BB, PAND, KOSS, SCKT, LOTZ, AMC, BILI
* Gapping DOWN: PING, PLUG, BCRX, BBY, TDOC, BUD, FCEL, BNGO, MVIS, TLRY

**Small Cap Watchlist (*****under $10*****)**

1. NVOS: Saw a very volatile day yesterday after being uplisted to NASDAQ. Seeing decent volume in premarket, and I'll be keeping an eye on this one throughout the day. 
2. EXPR: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst, maybe just the meme momentum. Seeing good volume and price action in the premarket. Premarket support at around 3.38. Just don't go chasing trades. 
3. DYNT: Gapping up on news of renewed supply deal. Has seen decent volume in premarket, but price action has died down quite a bit. I'll be watching to see if it can get over the 2.55 level, otherwise, I won't be too interested. 
4. SSNT: Gapping up on news of acquiring another company. Hit a high of 13.41 in premarket, but is showing weak price action in premarket at the moment. Very low float, so this could see some volatile swings, especially if volume picks up. I'll be watching to see if it can get back over the $10 level. 
5. ASRV: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst, maybe momentum from past few days. Currently showing weakness in premarket, but I'll be keeping an eye on this one to see if it can recover. I'll be watching to see if it can get back over the $6 level. 
6. ASLN: Gapping up after announcing $18 million private placement. Seeing pretty low volume in premarket at the moment, but price action currently picking up. I'll want to see it hold up, as well as some stronger volume. 
7. TRUE: Gapping up after an analyst upgrade. Seeing low volume at the moment, but it is currently holding a new support level in premarket. We'll see if that lasts. 

Looks like we are going to see a mixed open, with stocks slightly in the red. Another 730,000 Americans filed for unemployment, which was actually less than expected. SPY is currently sitting at around 391, and given the strength in yesterday's trading, we could see a push to ATH. I'll be watching UVXY to play any potential volatility. Bitcoin recovered from yesterday, and is currently sitting at around 51,250. I'll be watching the crypto-related stocks closely today. Marijuana stocks are a bit mixed this morning. GME madness could resume today. If you decide to trade it, please make sure you have a plan to get out and that you are using proper risk management and sizing. People will be burnt, it's just a matter of when. 

Remember to use proper risk management, make sure you size appropriately for your account, and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-02-25 09:01:14
543,Why is AMD doing dropping like a stone?,"AMD has ultra strong fundamentals for $120 (currently in the 80s), their main competitor has been proven to be falsifying benchmarks, and not a single gamer/modder is using an Intel chip right now. NVidia are moving into new markets, but come on...... I don't understand the loss. I only play long (except for small amounts in fun stocks), so I'm not gonna realise a loss, but the volatility suggests the investors don't understand the industry AMD is working in.

Edit - Seems like my post isn't quite long enough for the Auto-mod, so let me elaborate.

547,Update on AMC,"Hi everyone, one of the many apes from amc stock here and I just wanted to spend a moment to tell you guys my unsolicited opinion about whats going on with amc stocks.  Now the amc stock generally follows the same trend as gme but there are a number of factors that suggest that tomorrow (02/26/2021) could be a fantastic time for others to join in on the stock if they have any interest.

Now why would tomorrow be a good time to go in on amc?

1.) Short interest->  so the hedge funds attacked this stock super heavily today (02/25/2021) with shorts dropping it by just over 20%.  This has created a problem for the people gambling on amc stock to drop for two reasons. The first is that they are left with only 75,000 shares left total to play with tomorrow and secondly because they put AMC under ssr protection for all of 2/26/2021 which makes it increasingly difficult to continue to short the stock through tomorrow.  Now this is just one apes oppinion but if the hedges arent able to drop this stock down tommorow and all retail investors are buying and holding than I cant see why the stock wont shoot back up tommorow (I imagine most of the paper hands retail investors were scared off already by the huge dip we had today).

2.)Gamma Squeeze Potential-> So by the end of market hours tommorow there are a number of significant options expiring with the heaviest numbers starting at 8 dollars.  for example if amc ends at over 8 dollars than  61,263 options will activate equating to over 6 million shares being traded and gamma squeezing the price up by monday  (And that isnt even including all the options that activate <8).  At the moment the stock is sitting at about 7.50 and if my first point about the hedge funds is correct than 8 is a number that should be relatively easy to hit.

3.) long term value-> So should the worst situation happen and the stock plummets again tomorrow negating the chance for a gamma squeeze, than there is still value in keeping amc as a mid to long term stock.  We know that when amc diluted their shares they were able to refinance their debt with the money they gathered so bankruptcy for them is off the table through the rest of 2021.  That means they have until roughly mid 2022 to start generating profits and we all know that covid vaccinations are already starting to roll out, alongside the theatres which are starting to open up.

&#x200B;

And I just wanna end this by saying im not a financial advisor, just a random ape that has done a little DD and wants to share what I personally believe could be a good opportunity for us all to get those tendies.  Let me know what you guys think,thanks!

Sources for my info -> Fintel, yahoo finance, tdameritrade

&#x200B;

Edit: Hey guys I really dont wanna spread misinformation so I just wanted to point out that the amc stock being worth 20$ pre covid was wrong, looks like it was actually tanking through 2019 ending at around 8 when covid hits.  Treys trades did me dirty on that fact (he's always talking about amc price pre covid D:).  Still though Im Sorry apes. I do Still stand by my other points though for the short term and in future posts I will be more careful in what I post. love u guys!",2021-02-26 00:26:40

*What does this info mean?*

It means these stocks are behaving with more volume and/or price swings than normal. These stocks are likely due for huge up or down swings. However, they may have already experienced them. I wouldn't invest in any of these without proper DD. You want to make sure you know what you're getting into. If a stock hasn't risen a lot but is seeing large anomaly, it may be due for a huge rise or drop. No guarantee here. To emphasize: this list won't guarantee you get rich or go broke - it just means the odds of extreme change are higher if you invest in these stocks. You have been warned.

Note: There may be slight discrepancies in data compared to true trade values simply due to when the actual data sample takes place.

551,Robinhood to plan confidential IPO filing as soon as March,"Robinhood Markets Inc., the trading platform behind the boom-and-bust swing in GameStop Corp.’s shares, plans to file confidentially for an initial public offering as soon as March, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company has held talks in the past week with underwriters about moving forward with a filing within weeks, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. No final decision has been made and the timing could change, the people said.

A representative for Robinhood, based in Menlo Park, California, declined to comment.

Robinhood exploded in popularity during the pandemic as homebound young people turned to its trading app to make money and pass the time. The company, which has been targeting a 2021 IPO since at least last year, faced a cash crunch when it ran into regulatory trouble three weeks ago.

Robinhood had to draw down its credit lines and raise $3.4 billion from its backers to post more collateral with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., the industry’s clearinghouse. The DTCC wanted members to post more cash to ensure they could clear trades, given wild swings in stocks including video game retailer GameStop and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.

Robinhood is also facing political and customer backlash because it temporarily curbed trading in GameStop and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.

Robinhood is also facing political and customer backlash because it temporarily curbed trading in GameStop and other stocks.

Robinhood was valued at $11.7 billion in a funding round last year. That company has been considering selling some of its shares in its IPO directly to its own users, Bloomberg News reported. Such a move would be striking because retail investors usually don’t get to buy into new listings at the offering price. Instead, they typically have to invest on the first day of trading in a rush that can drive up the stock price.

553,"Am I doing this right? Am I doing good, bad, great? What can I expect to make? Can I quit my job and be a trader? Realistic expectations","Hello everyone. I came on Reddit exactly 1 month ago  on January 27th. When I came on due to the buzz created over GME AMC I  had some high expectations. I heard of Reddit and never heard of  Wallstreetbets and had an idea it would be a very sophisticated group of  traders. I expected everyone to be using charts, technical analysis.  For some crazy reason, In my mind I thought the members would even meet  in an auditorium or rented out office and rattle ideas, brain storm...  Why? When I saw GME, AMC, BB, BBBY, BBW, KOSS, NOK, and many other  shorted stocks go thru the roof. I had thought in my mind this has got  to be the most sophisticated group of traders. I had better join them  and either, share ideas and do amazing, or get noticed for being better  than them.... Immediately within the very first 10 minutes I was  appalled, and WSB was not even close to what I imagined, WSBNEW as well.  I was appalled that investors would say apes, autists, diamond hands,  tendies, (though I absolutely love tendies), and I am still learning the  lingo. But just look at this in my eyes, I am a very successful trader,  actually probably one of the best and we are getting to that shortly,  but I am covering my mindset for this post. So you have no clue after 24  hours what was on my mind, my initial thought of sophistication and  skilled traders....were unfortunately, replaced with apes following a  heard and diamond hand everything. I am sorry if I offend anyone but I  call it like it is. Only days after I read many posts about. ""I am going  to quit my job! I am going to put my life savings into this. I am the  best. Check out how amazing I am. What did you make.... and you.... Etc.  Keep in mind this was the end of January before GME and AMC crashed.  GME has recovered off the lows but for how long? So because of this, and  because it is a common question I am asked. How much do you make? What  Can I make in a year? Am I doing great? Here it is.

 

**Historically since  the S&P 500 was created it returns about 8% annualized since  inception. The SP is a basket of 500 stocks and is widely regarded as  ""The Market"" because it is diversified and is supposed to include 500 of  the best companies. The Dow consists of just 30, it is considered very  important but because the basket is much smaller it isn't considered as  the market.**   
 

 

For simple terms I will be using $10,000 as an  example in every case but my own and 10 years because to me, to be doing  good this must be done over a 10 year period. A very good money manager  returns about 10%. So SP $10,000 turns into $14,600. Good money manager  $10,000 to $15,900. So if you are beating the SP and good money  managers you are doing good. But this has to be done over time....Well  what about the absolute best? The best money managers have returned  about 15% over 10 years that's $10,000 to $19,400. Keep in mind everyone  has a bad year and if you beat the best. You are doing great!   
 

Now lets look at 2 exceptions that have done great,  1. Cathie Wood is a Rockstar because ARC did return 155% over 2020,  $10,000 to $25,500. 2. Bill Ackman 120% $10,000 to $22,000. They both  had bad years before. In the case of the newly minted Cathie Wood her  fund even with the amazing 2020 is now up about 70% over 6 years, (keep  in mind the miracle 2020) If you take out 2020, her fund up until 2019  was close to 20%. Because 6 years is not enough, for the sake of  argument let's say Cathie is the best guru of all money managers and she  is going to do 20% over 10 years, NONE HAVE....$10,000 would be below  $24,000... So if you are doing anything near this $10,000 to $24,000 and  in 10 years you are a professional! But wait, Cathie is up even more  with my $10,000 so you are saying she is going to lose money and it will  come back to $24,000. Yes, I am! No money manager at any fund has  returned 70% a year for 10 years.. None! Is it possible, yes but she  will need to rotate out of her high fliers, which got her there in the  first place.

 

**Now let us go to me,  and I understand this could also be why people are upset because I say I  am better than 99.9% of any money managers and I am as good as Ray  Dalio. Ray Dalio is considered the best money manager in the world over  40 years at 11% which is remarkable.** $10,000 for 40 years at 11  is near $45,000. Which is remarkable. Ray will not handle an account  under $100 million now, and you must have assets over $500 million to be  invested with Bridgewater.

**I started in 1995  with $2,000 and in total I put in about $15-17,000. For the sake of  argument let us just say I started with $17,000 and somehow let's say  the best money manager in the world did 20%... I just told you none has  done 20% for 10 years. $17,000 would be $89,000 for 26 years at 20%. In  2000 I lost $76,000 on Priceline alone. (Which is now BKNG) I had 1,000  shares at 85 and I sold at 9.... It is now $2,500 (2.5 Million) I am  just telling you a matter of fact why I can say that with confidence.** Yes, things could be different if I handled so many accounts, money, who knows, but that is why I say it.   
 

 

So to sum this up if you don't understand, if you  arent a stock picker pick index funds which would get you $800 a year  for $10,000. If you choose a mutual fund, they also have fees, the best  do 12-13 Percent  and you can expect $1,200 to $1,300 from $10,000. If  you think you are better than Cathie or Ackman you can make $10,000 into  $22 - 24,000. Is this realistic? Ask yourself are you better than them?  Better than me? Try and be realistic. If you have $100,000 in your  account and want to be a day trader for the rest of your life, is it  safe to say you will make $20,000 every year... NO!!!! Can you have a  good year, a few....even 5 yes! 10 years and make 20K a year NO!!! If  you believe it, then you are a professional! Now if you have 1 Million,  yes... it is safe to say you can make 100 to 150,000 a year and pretty  safely.

 

Keep in mind if you gamble you can do much better  but over 10 years? Really? You want to look yourself in the mirror and  say you are better than top money managers for 3 good months, 6 good  months? because you jumped on the GME AMC freight train? Really? Beause  you came in when the SP was down 30% off the bottoms and you are in the  wild bull run.... I am just trying to set expectations and not make  enemies.

 

I apologize if for every $10,000 you put in I do not  feel realistically that you can expect to make $1,500 year in and year  out. Yes for a few good years... But that 1 bad year is going to wipe  everything out for gambling.

 

**By 2000, it took me 5  years t invest everything I put in about $17,000 to ride to a high of  close to $400... I was riding options, margin, 5x buying power, I  gambled like crazy then I was humbled with the dot com bubble and came  crashing near $100... still great with $17... But I am giving people  insight. I hope this answers questions.**",2021-02-27 18:31:00
554,Why I love the AMC Stock,"Sorry if my English is not the best. I'm from Germany 🤐🤣

A simple Reason why I think we should all go in AMC without nearly any cares about losses and hold it. 

The Value is very low now and we all know what's going on this time so we have a very huge chance to make a huge amount of money and even if this gamma squeeze won't happen in near future we will win or at least go out without losses.

AMC has many Cinemas around the globe and everyone loves going to the cinema. After the Covid-bullshit when they can open again with full capacity, the company can earn money again and has a good chance to grow again in long term and we all can take our money back. Maybe one month, maybe one year, who knows. 

And please remember the rumors about the corporations with Amazon and Netflix. 

That's why I use every penny I can get to buy and hold AMC until we reach the Andromeda Galaxy. 

But that's NOW. If Monday everybody starts to think like this and buy before the price reaches unrealistic dimensions to get it back, it can be a little more struggle psychologically. 

I will use the low price at this time to build out my position and enjoy this ride into the core of singularity like I've seen in the Interstellar movie. 

I'm not a financial advisor, just saying, but I'm very proud of my ape family and full of confidence and love for everyone of you. ❤️🐵🦍💎👐💎👐💎👐🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-02-28 20:04:03
555,AMC and dilution,"I'm pretty bull on AMC as a long term value play, but how much does the dilution affect intrinsic value? 

I tried to get my head around the debt restructuring for shares, and new shares issued. It's a lot it seems. 

AMC had to add cash to its balance sheet quickly through a series of stock and debt offerings. All told, AMC more than tripled its shares outstanding, up to 374,097,577 shares from 103,849,861 shares reported at the end of 2019, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

So if you bought before the dilution. Is the stock now 1/3 of value?",2021-03-01 14:49:13
556,AMC options..,"Hey guys. Sorry to being the Meme stocks here but my play started off not based on the hysteria. A bit ago when AMC was dirt cheap I bought a bunch of 1/21/22 calls $27 strike price. With the recent wild volatility that’s obviously got them sitting nicely right now even though we are nowhere near my strike price. So would you guys advice maybe selling some of the contracts ITM and holding onto my conviction and riding it out hoping it reopens strongly? Also seeing the CEO give himself a 3.75 MM bonus was awful to see when investors saved them from bankruptcy, so I’m skeptical on their leadership to keep the momentum going. Thanks for any help/input.

EDIT: Thanks for the help guys! And as pointed out, I incorrectly stated ITM which clearly the $27 strike isn’t near that lol I meant they were already profitable some days because the insane volatility and jump in price since I bought. I think I’ll sell some soon and hold a few for the long run. Thanks again everyone, learning as I go!",2021-03-02 11:11:57
557,AMC Prediction: March 5-March 11 Huge Gains,"# Let's start a little about AMC [Last Year Especially]

AMC is an old American company made in 1920 and it has been around for over 100 years. This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives.

Now over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \[steadily\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.

Early last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low.

So to sum up why it was low last year.

&#x200B;

* Streaming services being used more
* Cinemas closed due to Covid.
* No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]
* Bankruptcy possibility
* Free reign hedge fund short selling
* No one buying the stock

# Now this year is different

We all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.

# Overvalued or Undervalued?

For the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.

&#x200B;

* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for personal use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.
* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.
* ~~No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson & Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.
* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.
* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \[if not most\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.
* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back now by hedge funds.

Now I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.

# Now Lets Talk About March

&#x200B;

* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.

[Notice March is at a peak or leads to peak in every year except Covid year 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8769f5da609797539e1ca54e6dd4f86bdd6cd120)

&#x200B;

* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares

[Wanda Group converts stock in order to sell, preparing for a rise in price to sell off?](https://preview.redd.it/0fuvle80gpk61.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=268064ee98cc124da9edad6f02e4c9d572b195e4)

&#x200B;

# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.

A lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different.

&#x200B;

* March 5th \[this Friday\] theaters will reopen in NY \[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.

[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)

&#x200B;

* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \[my belief it is\] this will drive the price up farther.

https://preview.redd.it/ecj12fvpjpk61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0c958ae57f36fa18ed22e20341f4b6b80d248398

* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)

Not only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)

*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating that Amazon or Netflix may buy AMC and this day could be the announcement date. It is entirely possible AMC would come up with some good news even if this were not the case for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*

&#x200B;

* Texas will lift all Covid restrictions March 10th, farther reason for price to possibly go up.

&#x200B;

* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \[March 5th\] to Short interest report \[March 9th\] and Earning report \[March 10th after hours into 11th\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock. I am not telling any of you to do anything I am just sharing information and my thoughts.

559,Retail investors care more for the success of American businesses than Wall Street,"From Saturday's Wall Street Journal article on AMC:  


""As the (AMC) stock rocketed the next day, day traders exhorted each other not to sell, flashing images of diamond hands on social media to signify the strength of their commitment. But back among AMC's long-standing investor base of Wall Street players, there was money to be made. Silver Lake, which held a $600 million investment in the company's bonds, immediately capitalized on the rally by converting the debt into equity and liquidating its entire position, capturing a $113 million profit.""  


When I read this I was really pissed, until I read on and saw what it meant for AMC . . .  


""Silver Lake's quick decision amounted to a material gain for AMC. 'It was immediately beneficial...cause we got rid of $600 million of debt,' Mr. Aron said.""  


""Mr. Mahmoodzagedan, AMC's investment banker, said, 'The retail investor (that's you beautiful smoothbrained retards)  clearly had more faith in the long-term viability of this company than a lot of the institutional investors did.' That, he said 'gave the company a major life-line. The retail investor really helped create that bridge to a post-pandemic future.'""

561,"Uranium - fuel of the future, opportunity of the lifetime","Before you start reading, let me tell you this: There’s a lot of text down there. A lot. But I wouldn’t have written if I didn’t see it worthy of your time and if i hadn’t my skin in the game fully and openly.

First, take a look at this picture. What does it tell you?

https://preview.redd.it/bcuhfquxz6l61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e86bbb10d73ab04593659f91afeaa0eac4a8b13a

I’ve been doing research on uranium for two years now - ever widening my perception on the most undervalued and frowned upon commodity and fuel we’ve got. Yes, the fuel of nuclear power plants.

For me that picture tells that there’s a huge, order of magnitude size correction and price discovery happening in uranium quite soon.

Uranium is not a GameStop. It’s no AMC or Nokia either. It’s the fuel that keeps our lights on, refrigerators cool and Teslas rolling. It’s what makes GameStop, AMC and Nokia roll. You get the picture.

Uranium’s price will eventually go above and beyond anything we’ve seen yet and I’m about to explain why this is happening.

It’ll require not only diamond hands, but STAR HANDS to hodl because this isn’t going to happen to over night, it’ll happen in due time when markets and participants of uranium sector find out what’s coming to them:

Inbalance in supply and demand - the real force behind price movement.

Why is uranium worth of your attention and time/effort put in research? Simply because there is no other play out there with such a huge potential in short term. No silver, no copper, no gold, no Tesla, no Bitcoin, nothing. Well, maybe Bitcoin, but beyond that nothing else.

Take a look at the picture again to see the potential we’re talking about.

There’s no other commodity that is so mission critical it’s a security issue for many countries in a way that acquiring it is A MUST - or there won’t be electricity anymore and part of a society/country would collapse/malfunction. It’s a lifeline, security issue, political influence and baseload for countries.

Uranium is probably the most opaque sector there is. Also probably one of the deepest there is regarding research. It’s a whole unique supply chain from uranium mine to a utility’s reactor, from conversion to UF6 to enrichment and assembling of the rods. But let’s not go there this time - that’s not too relevant for the investment case.

Uranium comes in two prices, spot-price and long-term contracts price. Spot price is the price you pay as carrier/trader/middle-men while trying to find a buyer for excess supply of uranium. Long-term price is the price utilities pay to a uranium mine when they sign long-term off-take contracts lasting usually about 10 years.

And this is where the fun and investment thesis starts: Way too many of western utilities are at the end of their contract cycles and are about return to negotiation tables in 0-5 years time. Annual demand for uranium is \~180 million pounds but it’s estimated that deficit for 2021 is already around 40 million pounds.

Kuva

There is no new substantial production coming online in next 1-3 years and during next 5-10 years four of world’s biggest uranium mines are going to close down due to depletion of resources.

Let it sink in for while.

There is no new production coming online due to depressed uranium spot-prices. And the deficit will grow even worse during next 5 years.

At the time of writing this uranium price is around $30/lbs. Especially junior mining companies need uranium price around \~$50-60/lbs in order for them to first acquire funding and only after that start building their mines. That’s because their AISC, all-in sustaining costs, are around those numbers - and lenders and stakeholders know this since according to JORC Code miners have to state these figures. No shareholder of a mining company would allow management to sell their only income producing asset below price levels that are sustainable.

[https://ycharts.com/indicators/uranium\_spot\_price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/uranium_spot_price)

”But nuclear power is dead, it’s not green because of waste and countries will close their uranium power plants soon.” This is the narrative people unfamiliar and/or against nuclear power hang themselves into since they are unwilling to hear the truth that has been clouded for several reasons.

First of all, nuclear power isn’t going away - in fact there are more reactors coming online, being built, planned and proposed than in decades. China has finally realized they won’t be able to reduce carbon emissions without nuclear power (since it doesn’t produce any emissions) and they are rapidly ramping up their reactor building capacity. Same goes with India and Russia. Even Saudi Arabia is planning on building 16 reactors. France is prolonging lifespan of it’s oldest reactors, utilities in USA has withdrawn their intentions on closing down reactors.

You can verify this yourself by taking a look at this World Nuclear Energy Association’s sheet [https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/world-nuclear-power-reactors-and-uranium-requireme.aspx](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/world-nuclear-power-reactors-and-uranium-requireme.aspx)

Meanwhile coal power is indirectly killing around 5 million people annually, renewables have turned out to be a disaster in Germany and California because they cannot act as baseload energy supply when there’s no wind or sunshine and there aren’t sufficient enough battery technology available yet to store the excess energy generated during surplus times.

Here’s the investment thesis eye-opener: last time, during 2007-2008 bull run, there was NO real deficit - only impending one. This time there is real deficit. It makes complete difference, fully and totally.

World needs uranium. And there isn’t enough of it above ground right now - especially since more and more reactors are being built, and we haven’t even seen SMRs yet.

Not enough uranium - lights go off. And prices through the stratosphere.

Okay, so the investment case is there and it’s solid - too much ever growing demand and not enough production. But why would you invest in very very very risky junior uranium mines without a real mine online and only project papers and piece of land in their pockets? There’s gotta be something else, right?

Yes, there are two companies involved in holding uranium directly.

But because bull market will rise all the boats, and especially those junior mines if they are able to survive and withstand the long lasting bear market in-between. That’s how you define a company worthwhile considering adding to your portfolio.

Not only will junior mining companies’ share prices rise, but they are leveraged plays on commodity price movements. The better the company - bigger reserves and better grade - the bigger the leverage on assumed or, even better, realized profits.

In short, share price of uranium company will multiply according to uranium spot price movement.

No need to buy complicated calls or puts. Just take a look at mines, learn about the industry and world meanwhile, and invest.

Take a look at these [miningstockeducation.com](http://miningstockeducation.com/) videos from few years back and listen to what author Bill Powers has to say about investing in junior mining stocks. After these videos everything makes sense:

Oh, and you don’t have to take my word for it. Go and check out John Quakes’ or Uranium Insider’s Twitters on this matter to find out more:

Mike Alkin and Timothy Chilleri at Sachem Cove have done the most profound and deepest research on uranium, SmithWeekly covers uranium in their in-depth analysis and reports. You can search for these people on YouTube.

I’m just a nobody with my primary uranium portfolio up around +300% from inception. I have no track record, only two uranium portfolios (with a little bit of silver and copper added on top) and trying to change my life for good.

And cycle is only about to start turning.

Why am I telling all this? I \_know\_ people who literally changed course of their lives during 2007-2008 bull run totally. All they needed to do was to hold on to their uranium portfolio and sell just before peak. I wish nothing but the best for regular people like you and I.

No need to pump and dump.

Buy, HODL and sell all of them at price you seem fit for your strategy.

563,Question about Puts in regards to the GME and AMC situation,"Hey everyone, I'm fairly new to investing and have been trying to learn a lot about options. I've been following the GME/AMC storyline very closely for about a month now and something about it has me very interested when it comes to buying puts. 

Now I know when you buy a put youre betting on the stock dropping, so lets just theoretically say another short squeeze happens with either stock or both of them and you bought a bunch of, lets just say $100 Put contracts while the squeeze is at its peak or beginning to form a downward trend when everyone starts selling off, while also buying the contract at a farther off expiration date just to be safe. 

Would this be a good strategy? I know the more savy investors that were in GME were buying puts during the last squeeze to secure any losses, so I thought that it could be the easiest way to make money during this whole ordeal. But what do I know cause like I said I'm still pretty new to this and I admittingly have a position in AMC.

Tell me what you think and please tell me something I don't know! Thanks",2021-03-05 19:39:23
564,Question about Puts in regards to the GME/AMC situation,"I posted this in another sub but I guess no one saw lol. 

Anyway, I’m fairly new to investing and have been studying different techniques in options trading the last couple of weeks. Days like today and seeing how much money people have been making on puts with the market being red got me thinking of a different way to approach this GME/AMC storyline.

So I know that when you buy a put, you’re betting on the stock going down, so a day like today would’ve been a good day (at least before lunch) to short stocks like Tesla and SPY, and maybe buy calls on the way back up to double your money.

My question is this, let’s just hypothetically say a short squeeze happens with one of or both of these stocks. Would it be wise to buy a bunch of puts when the stock reaches their peak at a low strike price, let’s just $100? And maybe even set a farther off expiration date just to be safe? I’m curious because I feel like the money you could make off those puts could be much more than from buying stock, and even more of a safer play.

Would this be a good strategy? I know there’s no telling how high either GME or AMC could go in the event of a squeeze, but I figured the only sure thing that would happen is that they would eventually come back down lol. But hey what do I know I’m still learning this stuff, but I figured this would make a lot of sense, but I also have a position in AMC lol.

565,"AMC FILED w/SEC TODAY to INCREASE COMMON STOCK SHARES by 500,000,000 to 1,024,173,073 - Shareholders Vote MAY 4 - Effective Immediately if Approved. Please READ","I just re-edited to be less inflammatory.[Better Link to SEC Document](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)

This Friday 03/05/21 at 7:30 PM, I was surprised to see the B/A for AMC at  300/29000. So, for the first time since getting on this “rocket” on January 27th, and entering the market in December, I went to Edgar.  AND, It just so happened, that today, AMC had filed a notice for their shareholders meeting, at which a proposal to dramatically increase the shares of issued stock, will be voted on.

Here is a link to see the document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746921000518/a2243000zpre14a.htm#da47801\_proxy\_summary](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746921000518/a2243000zpre14a.htm#da47801_proxy_summary)

Here's a simplified gist of the summary:

1. **On January 27, 2021**, the AMC Board approved a Proposal to Amend their Certificate of Incorporation to increase the total number of shares of Common Stock they are authorized to issue an additional 500,000,000 shares to total 1,024,173,073 shares of Common Stock.
2. **On February 24, 2021**, they filed with the State of Delaware to *retire their class B common stock,* creating the current article of incorporation which authorizes them to issue up to  500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
3. **On March 5, 2021**,  an invitation to a shareholder meeting for **May 4, 2021** was filed with the SEC, whereupon the proposal, will be voted on.
4. The summary contains the following accounting ***as of close of business day, March 3, 2021***:  450,156,186  Shares of Common Stock, issued and outstanding\*\*.\*\* **Shares Reserved** ***that may or may not be*** **released prior to the EIP:**  **10,920,763** shares of Common  Stock,  **63,096,124** shares (*premium 50,000,000* \-  and *3,732,625 treasury*)
5. *So, for the next 8 weeks,*  then the RESERVED SHARES  are what may or may not be released, I guess.
6. On May 4, 2021 (assuming this is approved)  an additional 500,000,000  can be issued that would then total 1,024,173,073 shares.  The company may use these for private placement, public offerings, IPO's, stock splits, employee incentives, etc.

Can anyone enlighten me and/or assuage my concern? My concern being contained herein the potential Adverse Effects of Certificate of Amendment:

“Adoption of the Certificate of Amendment will have no immediate dilutive effect on the proportionate voting power or other rights of the Company's existing stockholders. However, any future issuance of additional authorized shares of our Common Stock, at the future direction of the Board (and generally without the requirement of stockholder approval, unless specifically required by applicable law or NYSE regulation) may, ***among other things, dilute the earnings per share of Common Stock and the equity and voting rights of those holding Common Stock at the time such additional shares are issued.”***

*****
> The Covid-19 aid package is on track for final congressional approval in the week ahead — and it could be a double-edged sword for markets.
*****
> The legislation should be greeted by optimism around the powerful lift it could give the stock market and the economy, but it could also be met with concern about what a historically large stimulus package could do to inflation and interest rates.
*****
> Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&P 500 higher, but the Nasdaq was dragged lower by interest rate-sensitive tech names. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has continued to press higher, revisiting its recent high of 1.61% on Friday, before trading at 1.54% in late trading. Yields move opposite price.
*****
> One wild card for stocks could be how interest rates behave around upcoming Treasury auctions.
*****
> There is a $38 billion 10-year auction on Wednesday and a $24 billion 30-year bond auction on Thursday.
*****
> Traders are watching these closely, after a historically weak 7-year Treasury note auction in February sent rates higher, even for the 10-year.
*****
> “We’re a little more cautious on them, just given what we saw in the 7-year and some Japanese selling pressure,” said Ben Jeffery, strategist on the U.S. rates strategy team at BMO Capital Markets.
*****
> He said Japanese institutions could be less interested in participating before the end of their fiscal year on March 31.
*****
> # Stimulus coming
The Senate was expected to approve its version of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package and send it to the House for a vote during the week. Otherwise, the market is watching key inflation reports with the consumer price index expected Wednesday and the producer price index, scheduled for Friday.
*****
> “I think the markets will be watching closely the progress on the stimulus package,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I think they’ll continue to watch the 10-year Treasury move and we’re going to get CPI data. That’s going to inform on those moves.”
*****
> He expects stimulus to remain a factor that could sway markets.
*****
> Inflation has been a worry for markets, since rising inflation could crush margins and corrode earnings power. For bond investors, it would erode value and make interest payments worth less.
*****
> “As long as the rise in Treasury yields matches the pick-up in inflation, I think the market will be able to handle that. I think the challenge is when yields get notably above inflation...I like to see them closely matched,” said Arone.
*****
> He said the market is concerned that the next stimulus package could overheat the economy and create inflation, particularly as it comes on the heels of the package approved in December.
*****
> “I think it lends to the conversation, ‘do you really need another $1.9 trillion?’ Arone said. “We’re going to pour more gas on the fire, and with this $1.9 trillion that’s what the market is concerned about.”
*****
> Consumer inflation is expected to remain somewhat muted for February, after the 1.4% rise year-over-year in core CPI in January. But the pace of inflation is likely to pick up notably in March and April, since the comparisons to last year, when the economy was shut down, will likely look extreme.
*****
> # Choppy to continue
> Strategists expect the push-pull between interest rates and stocks to continue.
*****
> On Friday, rates were higher after a strong February jobs report and stocks were also higher. The economy added 379,000 jobs in February, about 160,000 more than expected.
*****
> “I don’t think 1.5%, 1.6% on the 10-year is terribly troublesome for the market,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. She said the speed of the move was troubling.
*****
> The rotation out of tech and growth into more cyclical names in the financial, energy and industrial sectors continued in the past week.
*****
> Energy was up more than 10% with oil prices, which were at a near two-year high. Financials saw the next strongest move, gaining 4.3% for the week.
*****
> “I think we’re in a choppy consolidation phase,” said Sonders.
*****
> “You’re seeing some extreme historical spreads between what energy and financials are doing recently versus tech and consumer discretionary,” she said.
*****
> Sonders added that even if the consolidation phase is close to ending, that suggests there could be more downside for some frothy names. “The good news here is I think it’s becoming a better environment for active stock pickers,” she said.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 10%, as of Thursday from its Feb. 12 high. But on Friday, the index turned around, gaining about 1.6%. That’s a positive sign for the market, particularly since it happened as rates moved higher.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 0.8% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.8%. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was down 2%.
*****
> “I think ultimately the higher quality segments that got hit in tech and communications probably did need to see a valuation reweighting,” Sonders said. “Arguably, we had some micro bubbles in the market, and they may need to suffer more downside.”
*****
> She said investors may want to adjust the allocation of their holdings regularly instead of waiting to adjustments around the calendar
*****
> “If you get a two three week, four five day surge in a particular sector, pare some back,” Sonders said, nothing that’s the opposite of what most people do.

> # Jobs Market Gets Reopening Boost

> US payrolls grew at a solid clip month over month in February, as progress in the vaccine distribution process appeared to boost growth by enabling more of the economy to reopen. Our opinion has always been that until we have achieved widespread vaccine distribution, the in-person segments of the labor market will be slow to recover losses from a year ago. We are becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect for a 2021 economic reacceleration, and we are heartened that the hardest hit segments of the jobs market may be beginning to reflect that view.

> The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added 379,000 jobs in February, exceeding Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ forecasts for a 200,000 gain. Large seasonal adjustments to the data did serve to boost the overall number by roughly 140,000, while January’s jobs gain was revised significantly higher from 49,000 to 166,000. Colder weather than normal may have also played some role, though the worst of the freeze experienced by middle America occurred just after the report’s observation window closed. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3%, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate of 61.4%.

> “Last month on jobs day, we noted our optimism around an improving trajectory for vaccinations and the implications that may have for future jobs reports,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “This has played out so far, and we expect continued vaccination progress to become more evident in the jobs numbers as the recovery reaccelerates.”

> Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% month over month and 5.3% year over year, continuing to signal that lower-wage workers have endured the worst of the pandemic’s job losses. Inflation expectations have been in particular focus for the market lately, however inflation risks from a tightening labor market are not of major concern for now in our opinion. We expect overall average hourly earnings to remain steady or even reverse as lower wage workers are rehired in service sector jobs, and we still have lots of slack in the labor market as we hover well below 2020’s peak employment.

> The composition of February’s report importantly signals a reversal of COVID-19-driven trends seen in recent months. Retail trade gained 41,100 jobs while the leisure and hospitably industry gained 355,000—two segments that have been hardest hit throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, professional and business services added 63,000 jobs and government jobs fell by 86,000.

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the jobs recovery in the leisure and hospitality sector has generally plateaued following an initial bounce. This segment of the labor market is highly dependent on in-person interaction, and has understandably suffered in a work-from-home environment. Unsurprisingly, service sector jobs have strongly correlated with broader trends in COVID-19 cases. The leisure and hospitality sector alone still accounts for about 3.5 million of the 9.5 million jobs lost compared to the February 2020 peak. And while we do caution against reading too far into one month’s numbers, we are excited to see this decimated sector tick notably higher in February.

> We have not had to look hard to find evidence that vaccines are having an impact. Nationally, seven-day averages for new cases have fallen to below early 2020 peaks, significantly below the highs of late 2020. Perhaps most crucially, the portion of the population most vulnerable to severe symptoms has largely already received at least one dose of the vaccination. A third vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in March, and this week President Biden estimated we would have enough supply of vaccinations to cover every adult by the end of May 2021. Once people can become comfortable with the virus trends, we expect widespread hiring in in-person industries to snowball quickly. February may have signaled a start to this trend.

> # Anatomy of a Bond Market Sell-off

> Coming into 2021, one of our higher-conviction ideas was that we would see rising long-term interest rates in the United States; it’s one of the reasons we recommended suitable investors consider an underweight to interest rate sensitive fixed income. However, we didn’t expect interest rates to move this high, this fast. The 10-Year Treasury yield started the year at 0.91% and ended the month of February at 1.41%, down from an intraday high of 1.61%. As such, core fixed income assets are off to one of their worst starts ever (remember that as yields go up, prices go down).

> “Core fixed income assets aren’t off to a very good start this year, but we don’t think investors should abandon high-quality fixed income assets as they play an important role in a diversified portfolio” says LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> **So what is driving interest rates higher? Changing expectations**

> Inflation and growth expectations are important factors into the fundamental outlook for interest rates. Broadly speaking, what we’ve seen in the bond market this year is a re-pricing of both higher inflation and higher growth expectations. Inflation expectations have steadily moved higher, and market-based gauges of inflation expectations are the highest they’ve been since 2011. We don’t expect much higher inflation expectations from here, but we are watching how additional fiscal stimulus flows into the economy. Additionally, it seems increasing economic growth expectations have picked up recently as well. An increase in growth expectations may put pressure on the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move away from its low interest rate policy sooner than expected, which has put upward pressure on longer-dated Treasury yields.

> An unfortunate byproduct of those higher expectations is that we’ve seen an increase in the volatility of the 10-Year Treasury. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, daily percentage changes for the 10-Year Treasury yield are above historical norms (each vertical line on the chart represents the one day percentage change in the 10-Year Treasury yield). As shown, over the past several months, yields have regularly moved 10-20% in either direction on any given day. We think this is due to the changing interest rate dynamic and believe that interest rate volatility will subside the further we get into this new interest rate regime.

> # S&P 500 Seasonal Pattern Suggests Weakness Likely Ending Soon

> In the above chart we have plotted five different S&P 500 seasonal patterns along side 2021 through today’s close. “All Years 1949-2020” and “All Years 1988-2020” represent longer-term and mid-term baseline patterns. “All Post-Election Years” includes every year that was a post-presidential-election year regardless of outcome. “1St Year Democratic President” applies to this post-election year and so does “Post-Election Year After Incumbent Party Loss.”

> When comparing 2021 to these various past seasonal patterns, this year’s performance is above average, and the S&P 500 is currently experiencing some of the weakness present in the other five patterns. Historical weakness (shaded in light blue) is most visible in the three post-election year patterns in February lasting until early to mid-March depending on the post-election year pattern. All three historical post-election year patterns suggest that current weakness could be ending soon.

> # Historic Surge for the Energy Sector

> The energy sector has certainly been on a wild ride over the course of the past year, perhaps the wildest of all of the S&P 500 sectors. The outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 caused such a demand shock that oil futures traded for a negative value for the first time in history, implying that someone would pay you to take delivery of their oil!

> Well, that’s in the rear-view mirror for the energy market now. Year to date, the S&P 500 energy sector is up over 29% as of March 2, according to data from FactSet, more than double the return of the financial sector, the second strongest sector thus far in 2021. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 energy sector is trading at a blistering 30% above its 200-day moving average, the most ever using data back to 1990. While this might seem bearish on the surface, previous surges above 20% have historically bought above average returns over the next year rather than below average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The case can be made that energy could be a bit stretched in the near-term, but momentum often breeds more momentum,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Energy has been unloved for quite some time, but we may be in the early innings of a larger rally for the energy sector as the global economy continues to improve.”

> A confluence of events may be spurring the boom in the energy sector. An expanding global economy, a historic winter storm that shut down major oil producing states like Texas and Oklahoma, and an output agreement from members of OPEC+ have sent oil prices soaring to their highest level since early 2019. It’s not just oil, either. Copper and lumber have surged past their 2019 highs as well. It’s no secret that inflation expectations have been on the rise, and the surge in commodity prices are likely adding further credence to the market’s view of higher inflation.

> We have continued to warm up to the energy sector, including upgrading our view on oil in January and then our upgrade from negative to neutral in our February Global Portfolio Strategy publication.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week and month ahead r/stocks.",2021-03-06 07:25:53
569,"Laid off and daytrading. 28k in, PDT, and margin. My apprenticeship, if you will.","Former penny stock trader, current long term investor with retirement money, now turned active day trader when I got laid off first of the year. 

The first month I started trading mid-large cap companies, 1-2 companies a day, scalping 100 shares at a time, 10-15 times a day.   I was profiting about $150 a day, and holding overnight.  

February rolled around, and I figure, I’m doing good...time for margin.   Started the same thing, bigger share purchases, and maxing out margin.   First couple weeks went well, never trading “risky” stocks. (Although I did get into the GME, AMC train)

Success blinded me a little, and I changed strategies again, going from 2-4 companies a day, to 8-10.   Unfortunately, I got caught in some, bought more to average down, and watched my overnight holds get bigger and bigger.   2 weekends ago I was maxed out on cash/and margin over the weekend.  Not only paying interest, but holding 28k in positions that wasn’t my money.   (I do have available cash to cover if I got called). 

I was up about 5k on the year going into last week.  I made the decision last week to get out of my holds, clean up my account, no matter what the cost.   Over the course of this past week, I lost about 2k off that.  

As this weekend starts, I currently hold zero positions (I do have some options), have all my cash and margin available, and I feel free, with a profit of 3k since 1/1/21.  

I may not be getting rich, but I have learned a shit ton in the last two months, and I’m still green in the profit column.  

I’m not giving advice to anyone, but my personal changes going forward are:

-Never hold overnight.  I have no interest in stressing on what kind news may or may not affect my holdings 

-Dont chase a trade down.  No more averaging down.  If I make a bad trade, I will get out and accept the loss.   

-Green is green.   If your trade is successful, take the profit.  I’ve gotten caught multiple times hoping for more reward, then losing my initial profits. 

-FOMO can kill your account, if you missed the boat, look for something else 


I’m not looking for tips or tricks, writing this to help me make sure I follow my own rules moving forward. 


TL:DR.   Laid off, put 28k into day trading account, made money, lost money, learned a shit ton.",2021-03-06 13:51:59
570,Vanguard and Blackrock," 

What do both of these companies have in common? Both have large institutional holding in AMC and GME. Both have ETF's that have significant amount of AMC and GME holdings in them. These ETF's generally have similar holdings in them in general too. It's not easy to find short data on ETF's but both of these companies ETF's that hold both GME and AMC stock seem to be heavily shorted.

I'm generally pretty low in knowledge on the workings of these kind of things so I hope someone can look into this further. Vanguards ETF's don't seem to have much option activity but Blackrock's do. One in particular is IWN which has seen significant short activity. It has a dividend due the week after 4 witching day and speculation is that ETF's with GME and AMC holdings can all call in their shorts at the same time due to tax implications on dividend payments. This could cause a huge short squeeze. Well if you look at the call options for IWN it has over 500,000 open interest contracts ITM at or below a strike of $230. That seems insanely high to me. Especially seeing that it's average daily volume is only around 28 million for the past 2 months. And highest daily was only 59 million.

Another thing I found extremely odd is that if you look at the high short interest list Vanguard and Blackrock have large holdings in basically all of the companies up top. AMC, GME, BBBY, STK, RKT, ASO, BYND, SPWR and the list goes on. I understand that they are two of the largest holding companies in the world but that still seems odd. Most of these companies have unusually high option activity on March 19.

I think what we are seeing is a direct attack on Vanguard and Blackrock holdings in general and GME and AMC are just along for the ride. Vanguard and Blackrock seem to be winning the fight too. Another point of interest is that both Vanguard and Blackrock have been outspoken about a green energy future. Could that be the reason for the attack on them along with the dip we've seen in green energy markets recently?",2021-03-06 16:40:35

572,Meme Stock or Future Potential? AMC Entertainment,"So like many of us, I've been following this movement with meme stocks very closely wondering if there is money to be made other than just some quick day/swing trades. I've done a ton of research, specifically on AMC because although many expect the ""squeeze"" for GME to be much more likely, the price it's at is very unrealistic and so IF it doesn't happen, then there's not much in terms of future value with a stock already prices that high. Basically it seems much more reliant on a squeeze than anything for your investment. 

AMC I'm looking at with a slightly different view.. yes it is a meme stock, yes it is overpriced at the moment, yes they have been bleeding money due to Covid..

But with all that said, apart from just the ""potential"" for a squeeze, this surge in price they were able to capitalize on and sell shares to raise funds last month to reduce their debt significantly. They also gained an extremely high amount of publicity and sentiment from the public, they have now discussed the option to issue even more shares (which will be kept basically in the war chest by the sounds of it) and I believe they have a very positive plan for them.

These shares can be used for many things, not just in a negative way by diluting shares to raise capital (which if they went this route, I'm sure they would have BIG plans for that money). Instead I think it may be used for positive things like dividends, a stock split or to protect themselves for after the squeeze and avoid a hostile takeover. 

Think about it, the company was in the dirt on the brink of bankruptcy and was/still is being heavily shorted.. why not make the big brain move and reward investors who saved them, and screw over the short sellers who tried to destroy them? Is this not what Tesla did? 

Of course, they are losing money, the Earnings report on Wednesday will show this. But that's not at all what I'm thinking about, investors these days aren't just buying things that make sense from a financial perspective. There is reports and facts backing that up.. So I'm actually fairly optimistic that they will release some big news with plans to grow and thrive long term. Is that a bit speculative? Sure, but they would be very smart to do this while everyone is riding the wave. 

They know they need to make change, thus my thinking of the current price actually a fairly reasonable price point. Not because of the current financials, but because of the sentiment behind what is currently happening and basically the value many are seeing just by holding and having faith that the company will improve its business model and come out with progressive growth ideas for the future. 

I'm NOT the typical meme stock investor relying on the potential squeeze. I am optimistic about the long term potential here, and think the downside risk is actually not as big as people think (unlike GME at its current price). When I say long term potential, I'm thinking maybe $12-15 over the next year or so? Do I hope it can be higher? Of course, but I think that's on the safe side, while my downside price point is around $6. So I definitely see a higher reward vs risk potential in AMC. 

There are plenty of other DD posts around if you are looking for some numbers to back this thought/theory up. I have read all of them, and have come up with this prediction on my own. 

Let me know your thoughts, I'm very open to reasons why this is NOT possible! 


My Position: 780 shares @9.3",2021-03-07 17:25:22
573,"Expected moves for the week. SPY, Tesla, Docu, AMC, Oracle and more","**Market Volatility**

At the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **2%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $376 to the downside and $392 on the upside. The Nasdaq and Russell saw wild swings last week and options are pricing larger moves for this week than SPY:

**QQQ 2.9%**  
**IWM 3.3%**

The VIX got near 32 on Thursday and closed below 25 on Friday after that monster rally back. Implied volatility in the big ETFs can sometimes have a hard time pricing two-way movement like last week. The indices were practically unchanged on the week but were seeing intraday moves larger than what options were pricing for the entire week. The VIX collapsed on Friday on that rally but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. In other words, if one is trading pure IV out a month or more those changes in VIX are tradeable. If one is trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... where the VIX or individual stock IV is at entry is less important.

**Tesla** is an interesting name right now as it's sort of representative of the selling going on in recent high flyers. Even with the rally Friday afternoon in the major indices TSLA closed down on the day by 4%. Here's a look at TSLA's expected move over the next few weeks via Options AI:

https://i.redd.it/scv0hs3hlol61.gif

Options are pricing about a $50 move in either direction for this week, and about a $90 move for the rest of March. 

**Earnings this Week**

Earnings season isn't as active this week but a few names of interest do report. Here are a few of them, their expected moves for this week and how they moved in prior earnings. For a full searchable database you can use the Options AI Calendar (which is free to use). The links in the symbols are to the calendar, the prior earnings moves start with most recent and go back in time:

[PRTS](http://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NIO) / expected move **20%** / prior moves: -23%, +3%

[DKS](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/DKS) / expected move **8% /** prior moves: +0%, +16%, +4%

[AMC](http://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/WKHS) / expected move **17%** / prior moves +9%, +15%, +5%

[CLDR](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NVAX) / expected move 12% / prior moves +7%, -12%, -13%

[ORCL](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SHOP) / expected move 4.5% / prior moves +2%, -1%, -6%

[JD](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/TLRY) / expected move 7% / prior moves -7%, +8%, +4%

[DOCU](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/BIDU) / expected move 9% / prior moves +5%, -11%, -0%

[ULTA](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FSLY) / expected move 7% / prior moves -3%, +6%, +0%

A note on expected moves. Options need to price in both the overall market volatility and the earnings event itself. So a company reporting on Monday still has a few days for the stock to move after earnings and before expiration, while companies reporting on Thursday can move with the market before they report. The percentage moves will be roughly the same barring huge moves in market IV, but obviously what the percentage moves correspond to in the stock will change depending on where the stock is into its event.

The expected move is extremely useful not only to get a sense of how the crowd is pricing moves but also on strike selection in any option strategy. An oversimplified way to think of it is that if you own premium with a breakeven beyond the stock's expected move you need the options market to have underpriced the move, even if you get the direction correct. And if you are a net seller of premium you want the options market to be overpricing these moves, especially if you get the direction wrong.",2021-03-07 17:46:40
574,Help with my call options on AMC,"I have 100 shares of AMC and waiting for either a squeeze or a recovery play in a few months once theaters completely opens.


I bought a call option strike $10 that will expire this June and I sold a call option on my 100 shares at $14.5 strike.


My goal is to have small gains with selling covered calls while waiting for the squeeze so I set my strike at a prize higher. I was thinking that if the squeeze happened while I have a short position and the price shoots over $14.5, my 100 shares would be assigned but my call option would be ITM since the break even is $12.35.


Is my strategy ok? If ever the squeeze happens and shoots to around $30-50, would I still gain profits with my $10 option? If ever the squeeze wont happen, I'm betting that AMC would recover to around $20 by june and would just sell my option on a profit.


Please advice if my setup is feasible as I am thinking of closing my covered call tomorrow if I'm doing something wrong.",2021-03-07 21:00:05
575,"Morning Update for Monday, 03/08/21","Good morning everyone! Hope it was a nice weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks. Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management.

**Main Watchlist (*****over $10*****)**

* Gapping UP: GME, MARA, RIOT, NETE, IMVT, ATH, CUE, AER, FSR, XPEV, 
* Gapping DOWN: NIO, BABA, BILI, OPEN, DMYI, JD, TIGR

**Small Cap Watchlist (*****under $10*****)**

1. ANCN: Leading gapper this morning, but couldn't find a catalyst. Currently showing some weakness in price action in the premarket, but holding above new support of 5.48-5.50. 
2. EYES: Gapping up on momentum from Friday. Saw a huge day on Friday, so be cautious, as it could be overextended. It may provide good opportunities, but be patient and don't chase trades. Premarket resistance around the 8.50 level. 
3. XSPA: Gapping up on COVID-related catalyst. Seeing good volume in premarket, price action looks a bit better than it did earlier this morning. 
4. OPGN: Gapping up on COVID-related catalyst as well. Seeing good volume in premarket. Had great price action earlier this morning, things calmed down a bit but I'll be watching to see if things pick up again. Touched the premarket high of 2.69 twice already. 
5. EARS: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst. Seeing good price action, but I'll want to see volume pick up a bit. 
6. AMC: Gapping up on momentum. Reporting earnings this week as well. Seeing good price action and decent volume in the premarket. 

The market is looking to open mixed, maybe slightly in the red to start off the week. SPY is currently trading at just over 383. We are still hovering near a key support point, so we could see more choppiness today. Hopefully the stimulus news helps the market and we see some more strength. I'll be watching UVXY to take advantage of any volatility we see, though. Bitcoin is sitting at just under 51,000, and I'll be watching crypto-related stocks throughout the week. Gold and silver both down at the moment. Marijuana stocks have been quiet recently, but I'll still be keeping an eye on the, GME is trading higher in premarket, and I'll be keeping an eye on it throughout the day. Stay patient and disciplined in your trading, and let's start the week off right :)

Remember to use proper risk management, make sure you size appropriately for your account, and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-03-08 08:55:34
576,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 8, 2021.","Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. 

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights
The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

577,Potential big winners for investing," If anyone wants some good stocks that will be rocketing up in the next year or two.

Air Canada AC.TO - Pre Covid was trading for about $50 a share, however, they also purchased AirTransat for about a 10th of what they should have. Post Covid, I fully expect this stock to go anywhere from $70-$100 CAD a share

Ovintiv OVV - Pre Covid was trading for $60 a share, They tanked to about $5 a share when Covid started and have been consistently on the rebound, bouncing back to almost $30 a share. I expect it to go back to normal levels within the next year.

Cenovus Energy [CVE.TO](https://cve.to/) \- Pre Covid was trading for anywhere from $30-$50 a share. As of right now it's trading at $10.57. With the purchase of Husky Energy. Again I expect this stock to likely go to $50 a share within the next year or two.

H2O Innovations Inc HEO.V - This is an upcoming company with solid financials that is sort of treading new ground. Their stock just took a dip and is starting to recover. With the need for clean water and company foundations, I'd expect this stock to hover around $5 a share when things get back to normal.

Cineplex Inc [CGX.TO](https://cgx.to/) \- Everyone seems to be going crazy for AMC right now, along with the Gamestop situation. But, the theater company with the better financials and less risk is Cineplex, not only are they in a better position when everything fully opens back up to have a huge bounce back but they pay a better dividend as well.

FSD Pharma [HUGE.CN](https://huge.cn/) \- Pot company that is building massive facilities and expanding as quite a high rate. As Pot becomes legal in more places, they will continue to grow.

Supreme Cannabis FIRE.V - Another pot company that is expanding quite a bit and with the same concept as [HUGE.CN](https://huge.cn/), will continue to grow as it becomes more legal.... Just keep in mind it's a volatile market.

Namaste Techology N.V - This is a medical company that holds several patents and expanding into several new markets around the world.

Empower Clinics [CBDT.CN](https://cbdt.cn/) \- This is an absolute whale of a stock. One of the smartest CEO's in the business, They just signed a massive deal with Rexall, They just took in $15.5 Million. To hit 10 times Market cap at $2.50 a share, all it has to do is sell $50 million this year.... It's looking like they might do double that. I fully expect this stock to be at $3 a share by the end of the year, I expect it to hit anywhere from $8-$15 a share with the next 3-5 years. Especially because of the patents they hold, the contracts that are being signed, they are expanding at a rapid rate without debt.",2021-03-09 10:59:02

ELI5:  The last two days of GME/AMC movement seems to be driven by something other than a hedge squeeze. Volume is 1/5th of previous squeeze, order flows for GME per Fidelity is NET NEGATIVE (meaning more selling than buying) and for GME, near break even. Maybe, if we're lucky, we continue to see green for another day or two, but I have a bad feeling about a rug incoming, and it's going to be quick and sudden. 

The same goes for the energy sector with TSLA, NIO, XPENG among others. They've been beaten down and I don't see any reasonable shift towards such heavy green across the board. SPCE, Cannabis, etc. were all beaten down and have all resurfaced green. China stocks have also turned green after the blood week. I don't see this as a buy the dip as volume is simply too low. The LVL2 data all day for multiple tickers have been odd in that there were a pattern of similar numbers ( like 32 for GME) that kept showing up on the buy and ask side for hours.

 Learning as I go here, and looking into ETFS for myself and for my 6 year old. We will start with the account for the 6 year old.

Should I open a second WS account for this or just mix it together with my little learning experiment I have going?

*What does this info mean?*

It means these stocks are behaving with more volume and/or price swings than normal. These stocks are likely due for huge up or down swings. However, they may have already experienced them. I wouldn't invest in any of these without proper DD. You want to make sure you know what you're getting into. If a stock hasn't risen a lot but is seeing large anomaly, it may be due for a huge rise or drop. No guarantee here. To emphasize: this list won't guarantee you get rich or go broke - it just means the odds of extreme change are higher if you invest in these stocks. You have been warned.

Note: There may be slight discrepancies in data compared to true trade values simply due to when the actual data sample takes place.

588,💩 List: Know Your Enemies,"The wise Sun Tzu once wrote in his Art of War that

>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enem-

Alright, fuck this shit. You get the gist already. I'm pretty sure you've read this quote for the millionth time by now. I don't want to waste your time here.

I've compiled a shit list of all the bad guys whom you Gee Em Mee apes need to watch out for. Along with their names I will post their misdeeds and links to sources as evidence. This is by no means a comprehensive list and I will continue to edit/update it as soon as my team of fellow Gee Em Mee enthusiasts and I dig up more dirt and uncover more information on these shitheads that deserve nothing but scorn (but no death threats, please!).

Let's get to it.

**Gabe Plotkin (CEO of Melvin Capital)**: If you don't know who this guy is, then you're a massive idiot. Have you been living under a rock all this time? I don't think you should be investing in a stock whose fundamentals you don't understand quite clearly.Quick recap: Melvin is the bastard with the short position on Gee Em Mee.

Anyways, Gabe pulled the race card and made the absurd claim in his hearing [testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/testimony-of-gabriel-plotkin-founder-of-melvin-capital-management/8882e0d9-a683-4392-bc2e-87e56ba43baf/) that he received messages on Reddit like “it’s very clear we need a second holocaust, the jews can’t keep getting away with this.”

**But that was proven to be false**: WSB mod [/u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) debunked this claim in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm7z47/gabe_plotkin_claims_many_wsb_posts_were_laced/gntr31f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) . Also Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit aka [/u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/u/spez/) also debunked it during the hearings.

On January 31st, Gabe's ex-wife, Yaara, filed for divorce, citing ""irreconciliable difference.""

Rumors are floating around that the divorce was done on purpose to protect his assets.

&#x200B;

On March 3rd, CNBC reported that Melvin posted a [return](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/melvin-capital-posts-return-of-more-than-20percent-in-february-sources-say.html) of 21.7% in February. Yeah right. Getting back to CNBC later...

**Ken Griffin** (CEO of Citadel): Melvin's master. This prick is the one that is receiving your order flow data if you trade with any of these 9 [brokers](https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/02/citadel-is-paying-for-order-flow-from-nine-online-brokerage-firms-not-just-robinhood/).

Wait what? You thought only Robinhood was colluding with this bastard? Well think again and open your eyes. Look at their [quants](https://youtu.be/2u007Msq1qo). Just look at them. Notice anything different? Look at their monitors for Chrissakes.  These geeks got first place in their Math Olympiad contests. They can't even speak ape, goddamn it.

Back on January 26th, the Day of the Squozening, Citadel and his butt buddy Point 72 bailed out Melvin with a 2.75 billion dollar [injection](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305). Have fun being their bitch and doing their bidding for life, Melvin. lulz

[u/420redditpornacct69](https://www.reddit.com/user/420redditpornacct69/) has more dirt on this bastard right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7o2rq/know_thy_enemy_kenneth_c_griffin_the_barbarian/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**Steve Cohen** (CEO Point72): Fat fuck rescued Melvin as mentioned in the above entry. Also a white collar [criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(businessman)). Deleted his Twitter account because he was too chickenshit to deal with the trolls.

**Jim Cramer**: host of Mad Money/coke head/former hedge fund manager. I'm pretty sure you've seen this infamous short-and-distort [video](https://youtu.be/r07Gg92YjOI) that was not meant to be leaked. Works for CNBC, a shill media that is trying to divert our attention/sell the stock the apes oh so dearly love. Also:

&#x200B;

[Dude can't shut the fuck up about Gee Em Mee.  Credits to GMEDD.com for the image.](https://preview.redd.it/gmtsgzbl6fm61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aa3e384dc7e070bcd3155583596bc1be29526c0)

**CNBC**: shills whatever securities Melvin/Citadel and the rest of the shorts are holding. Silver/Es El Vee. Cee Cee Eye Vee/Lucid [(did you see that pump and dump on the 23rd of Feb? lmfao)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/811473329361518615/820083536433643550/chart.png) **(EDIT: That PnD happened exactly ONE DAY before GME spiked again on the 24th.  Coincidence?  Hmmm...)**. Rocket. Etc. etc. Talked shit about Reddit traders and [WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l54ky3/an_open_letter_to_cnbc/) for ages.

EDIT: [Along with MarketWatch, CNBC also reported the dip on GME early on March 10th.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2n44x/webull_confirms_cnbc_article_about_gme_price_drop/)

**Leon Cooperman** (CEO of Omega Advisors): Another irrelevant old geezer and hedgie. Got busted for [insider trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Cooperman) back in 2016 and paid a hefty fine, but keeps denying any wrongdoing. Imbecile really has a habit of crying on live air like an baby. In this [video](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs) he warns the audience that the squeeze ""will not end well for the public"" and in this video right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59xBSGe45gQ), he pleads with the media to ""not portray billionaires as criminals."" I can't make this shit up.

**Chamath Palihapitiya** (CEO of Social Capital): When he's not busy shilling his shitty SPACs and SoFi brokerage firm, this man child likes to post stupid shit on Twitter like "" Im about to really fuck some shit up...just fyi."" and douchy half-naked selfies with chicken legs.

Let's recap what this two-faced dumbass did:

1. [Bought $115 calls on GME on the 26th.](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232?lang=en) Quickly cashed them out (paper hand snake), gave it to charity, and went onto CNBC to give himself a pat on the back and to ""defend"" Reddit investors and WSB. More like find support for his potential run for governor of California and his shitty SPACs, amirite? [Fuck shit up, lulz.](https://i.imgur.com/XKmCfQU.png)
2. Lambasted Robinhood for selling data to Citadel, when his SoFi brokerage firm does the exact same shit.According to Wikipedia: In early 2021, during the [GameStop short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze), he repeatedly attacked [Robinhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinhood_(company)) and its founders for being unethical by selling payment for order flow to HFT firms like [Citadel Securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC) and pushed his fans to switch over to [SoFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi), which was merging with his SPAC. [SoFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi) employs the same practice of selling payment for order flow to HFT firms (including to Citadel Securities) and owns a 16% stake in Apex Clearing Corp a clearing house involved in the controversy.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-58)[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-59)[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya#cite_note-60)
3. Owns 16% stake in APEX. APEX is the clearing firm that prevented several brokers from allowing investors to purchase the meme stonks during the Squozening. More on that later...

**MarketWatch**: Hoo boy. This just happened today (March 10th, 2021), but man is the plot thickening or is the plot thickening? [At 11:55 AM EST, journalist Wallace Witkowski reported the dip on GME 25 FUCKING MINUTES before it began.](https://twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061) Uh, SEC, you seeing this shit?

For the record, I believe the shorts pumped and dumped GME today to scare the paper hands into selling. It was still up 6% for the day. Oops.

**The following list of brokers who restricted purchase of the meme stonks during the Squozening (credit to** [**/u/CriticDanger**](https://www.reddit.com/u/CriticDanger/) **for compiling this list):**

**Horrible Brokers - Restricted purchasing of certain tickets and lied/gloated about it**

* **Editor's note: Robinhood is being blamed as a sole scapegoat here. Remember, there are 9 (possibly more) brokers that are selling our order flow data to Citadel. Open your eyes. Thank you, I appreciate the attention. That's a wonderful audience. When I was a boy in Bulgaria...**

**Hall of Shame**

Not necessarily bad guys, but worth mentioning for the sake of lulz:

* Dave Portnoy: Paperhanded AMC, NAKD, and some other BANG-related stonks and lost roughly $700,000 by selling it.

589,A Trade Idea – Sorry about GOCO Yesterday Morgan Stanley is absolutely wrong,"Yesterday The Idea was GOCO and came out about 8AM. Morgan after 9AM put a downgrade on GOCO with a $13 Target

(By the way I do not care if this gets out to them, I hope it actually does so they hire me for more money, at least I do my job)**

**#2 They have a hidden agenda. (Money under the table, they do not like the company, the ceo, workers, their operations**

**#3 They just flat out believe GOCO forecasts are lying. GOCO has forecast 1.15 to 1.3 Billion in Revenue and between $1.07 to $1.40 earnings per share. Now, if you have read my posts I wil be the first 1 not to defend a CEO, company, figure head, analyst. However, I will also be the first one to say when a company has produced, they are executing and have a 1 year outlook (I do not want to hear a word about anything past 1 year), there is no way I am going to believe some garbage analyst over a company that is executing!!! I agree if the company is not and the analyst is making a point!! (AMC for example check out this horrible figures)**

**So, I do not care if you reach out to Morgan, because I am just Nathan from Queens, NY and I can’t do anything but I really hope this person reads this. Either you are doing a god awful job and being paid $200,000+ , you have other interests and are biased, or you flat out believe the company is lying!! Which one is it?**

Today’s Play

Carparts PRTS

I have been trading this since the pandemic over and over again. This has actually 1 of my most traded stocks for the past several months. (Yes, of course I have plays I do not just give to everyone). Yesterday I did 3x. I currently do not have positions at the moment. 2 clients own it at 14.65. 

Carparts.com has basically as it says, you can buy auto parts online. Mainly aftermarket parts. I have actually followed this for years but didn’t start trading again until the company was absolutely crushing it. Yes, I saw it under $5. I do not trade stocks based on a stock price, I do not chase stocks because of their stock price. When a company starts to execute and the coast is clear I would rather pay more at $10…. Than gamble at $5 and not know what is going on? So our recent catalyst is earnings were amazing. Yes, they are losing money, and as I said you do not touch a stock losing money when we are bearing. However last couple of days the coast is starting to clear. That said, even in a bearish market I will take a company that is absolutely annihilating reports and growing 90% + percent. 

Yes, the charts are going to be bad, red candle stocks (do to high volume sell off), but these charts do not take into a 90% sales growth. The company is now cash flow positive and if you check the last 3 quarters wow! This quarter was a 91% Year over year increase in sales. 70% last quarter… Yes, they are losing money, but you do pay for growth and that’s ok in a bull run.

The plan

I do not own shares and it is 5:30am. Depending where we are in the futures at about 9AM will determine my bid. I am hoping to bid close to my buys yesterday at around 14.60… If the futures are up big time maybe around 15. If this opens above 15… I may consider doing something else.

I have been trading this for about 50 cents a time.

Good luck everyone. Sorry for the long post. Happy trading and lets make money!",2021-03-11 06:47:27

591,"Morning Update for Thursday, 03/11/21","Good morning everyone! Happy Thursday.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks.

**Stocks Over $10**

* Gapping UP: MARA, RIOT, NIO, TSLA, GRWG, PTON, SPCE, FCEL, RBLX, AMC, VIR, AVEO, RSI, BMBL, SUNW, FUTU
* Gapping DOWN: GME, AMTX, KOSS, EYES, ORCL, HESM, YSG

**Stocks Under $10**

1. NVFY: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst. Seeing strong volume and price action in the premarket, just be cautious as it could get over-extended. Low float, so this could see some volatile swings this morning. 
2. SIEB: Gapping up after reporting earnings. Seeing good volume and decent price action in premarket. Also pretty low float, so could see some volatility early this morning. 
3. SPPI: Gapping up on lung cancer catalyst. Seeing decent volume and price action in the premarket. 
4. PHUN: Gapping up on news of a partnership. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, I'll want to see if that holds up. 
5. SLGG: Gapping up on news of acquiring Mobcrush. Seeing some weakness in price action at the moment, but I'll be keeping an eye on it to see if there's a revival before market open.
6. OGI: Gapping up on news of strategic deal. Decent volume in premarket, but could see some better price action. 
7. KERN: Gapping up on news of an acquisition. Seeing strong price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if that is sustainable.

The market should open nice and green all around, with lots of stocks gapping up this morning. SPY is trading at a little above 392 at the moment, and we should see some strength today, maybe even a push to ATH. If SPY takes a step back and makes it back down below the 390 level, we could see some choppiness. Bitcoin is trading at around 56,800. Bitcoin-related stocks are up in premarket and I could see them having a strong day for intraday trading. Marijuana stocks are following the market trend and are trading higher in premarket. Gold and silver are also up at the moment, and oil continues its climb again. GME is down in premarket, but I'll be keeping an eye on it today. Stay patient and disciplined in your trading, and let's have a good day.

Remember to use proper risk management, make sure you size appropriately for your account, and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-03-11 08:31:47
592,Anyone here trading the AMC options? I feel like they are too expensive to take on.,"With AMC in a lull and a lot of negativity around the earnings call. .. should we not expect IV in the options prices to drop.  I have looked at them multiple times and never found anything worth the risk to buy at this juncture. Find them very expensive for a stock that appears to now be trapped in a range.

593,AMC vertical spread,"AMC seems pretty closely correlated with GME stock, but regardless it has a high volatility. Why not just buy a put and a call on the stock, since it will more than likely rise or fall in the near future rather than go sideways, so that the increase in IV positively affects the extrinsic value of both the put and the call? That way if it goes up or down, you profit off of one option more than you lose from the other due to the positively affected EV on both options.

Edit: as pointed out by commenter, I am suggesting a strangle on the AMC stock

Edit 2: okay so my original post applies to both strangles and straddles, as they work similarly; just depends on your timing. Sorry for the misleading title I’m smooth brain af and still learning, thank you to all the commenters though your help and informative discussion is why I love this subreddit

594,I feel like I’m literally burning my money.,"Hello everyone,
A new “investor” here. I’ve been in the market for exactly 4 months. I’ve been losing money for some time now. And I’m trying to diversify my portfolio with the money I can afford to lose. And although I can afford to lose some. It feels really bad when I invested 2k that grew to become 4.5k and because greed I decided to hold further. Now I’m at $500. Still holding but torn between funding my account again or giving up on the entire thing.
My portfolio consists of BB, S$P, Gold, AMC, GD health a Chinese health care company that was doing okay but apparently everything is crashing before my eyes.

I know Im new and I have to learn maybe by losing but I still don’t understand. Is it really luck. 
I did research and I know some of the answers. I know that bb is already grew more than 100% since last year this is why its at somewhere around 10. I bought it at 13.
I know AMC is a stupid impulsive buy.
I have no idea how gold is draining my account and I’m just frustrated 

I don’t want to quit. I feel there is a huge learning curve. I read the wiki but still there are some stuff I don’t get. I know that when I lose money someone else gains it. But from what I can see everyone is not doing that good.

Watching YouTube sometimes helps but I feel like people are bias towards a certain stock they try to always push. Especially recently with all the GME crap that is happening.
I just don’t know what to do or how to learn.",2021-03-12 04:35:10

596,I've created an algorithm that scans social media sites to identify stocks that have had the biggest increase in chatter. I wanted to share the results of this week with you.,"The algorithm scanner chatter on a host of social media sites, like Twitter and Reddit, and tries to identify stocks that have seen the biggest regular increase in chatter. This helps me identify stocks early on, allowing me to look into them further before massive price increase/decreases.

The regular increase part is important, it means the algo filters out stocks like GME and AMC by default, but also, doing this helps minimise picking up pump n dump schemes.

I use this tool as a way to identify up and coming stocks, which I then perform research on, to weed out and bad ones. This is by no means a tool to blindly purchase all the stocks it picks up.

Next Earnings Release: May 2021

Updating two previous DD posts on Funko Toys with new information based on their latest conference call earlier this week ([DD1](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/l8fems/dd_funko_toys/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), [DD2](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lgm5db/new_info_funko_toys_dd/)).

Funko is well positioned for continued growth in 2021 with potential upside from entering the hot NFT market “fairly soon.”

(TL;DR at the end)

=====================================================================

Here are some highlights from their Q4 earnings report (3/11), Q4 earnings call (3/11), and an interview with the CEO this morning (3/12) with additional information on each bullet further down in the post (For more context please review the prior DDs linked above):

· Funko beat expectations with its second highest revenue quarter ever

· Growth is expected continue in 2021; driven by Europe, Loungefly, and other initiatives

· Multiple analysts increased their price targets on the stock after the earnings release

· Funko’s CEO Brian Mariotti announced the day after earnings that Funko intends to move into the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market “fairly soon”

=====================================================================

FUNKO BEATS EXPECTATIONS

· Net Sales in Q4 2020 was up 6% vs Q4 2019 to $226 million

o This represented Funko’s second highest revenue quarter in its history

o Outperformance was driven by the US market which had its highest revenue quarter in history and grew 18% vs. Q4 2019

o International was constrained by lockdowns; but still grew 10% vs. Q3 2020

o Non-figure product revenue grew 30% in the quarter vs Q4 2019

· Gross margins increased 37.2% in Q4 2020 vs. 29.2% in Q4 2019

· SG&A decreased 6% to $53 million

· Cash Flow From Operations increased 69% to $47 million

· Funko’s direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to the prior year

GROWTH EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN 2021

· Funko is forecasting 30% revenue growth in Q1 2021 (vs. Q1 2020)

· Full year sales growth is forecasted at between 25-30%

· Gross margin is expected to strengthen in 2021; driven by Funko’s direct-to-consumer initiative and from regional / distribution mix shifts

· Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 120 to 170 basis points to between 13.5% and 14.0%

· Many major Television, Film, and other properties held back because of the pandemic are expected to return as the economy opens up. This will create demand for new purchases.

o Marvel: It is expected that Marvel will be releasing about 5 new television shows on Disney + this year and another 5 films theatrically.

o Games: Several hot game properties will be releases later this year that will create more content from which to create Funko toys

o Other: Funko is always making deals for new IP licenses and expects to make a “major master toy announcement” fairly soon

· Loungefly and Snapsies product lines continue to grow and provide additional avenues for Funko to drive more sales growth

FUNKO THRIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC

· Despite many major releases throughout the pandemic beyond The Mandalorian, Funko was still able to drive significant purchase activity of it’s brand and products

o Evergreen content represented 68% of sales. (Evergreen content is essentially licensed properties that don’t have a major release associated with them at the time. For example, Harry Potter and The Office would be examples of Evergreen Television properties sold last quarter.)

o As the economy opens up, Funko expects more properties to become available for licensing and product development

· Funko was able to accelerate its move to create a direct-to-consumer website for Funko products in Europe ahead by two years ahead of schedule

o FunkoEurope.com was launched in Q4 2020 (October); allowing Funko grow its sales in Europe despite lockdowns

o Given that Funko’s direct-to-consumer site just launched, we can expect continued growth back to pre-pandemic levels in Europe over time as Funko drives traffic to its website and countries open back up from lockdown

o Five months ago, Funko started in three EMEA countries and has since expanded to eight countries in the region

· Funko’s diversification into other products like Loungefly bags and board games help Funko maintain growth during the pandemic

o Non-figure products represented 23% of revenues

o Funko’s expanded games portfolio grew 50%

o Loungefly grew 55% in Q4

\-- Funko will be expanding its Loungefly relationship with Amazon this year

\-- Loungefly is seeing strong demand across EMEA and other regions

o In board games, Funko launched new titles like Marvel Battleworld, Godzilla, Tokyo Clash, and Back To The Future to name a few

· Funko’s overall e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, expanding on strong Q3 2020 performance

o Total direct-to-consumer sales were 8% of revenues in 2020 vs. 4% the prior year

o Global mass market and third party e-commerce helped drive growth in 2020 as it represented 35% of sales in 2020 vs. 28% in 2019

· Funko adjusted by finding new ways to connect with fans during the pandemic as in-person events like San Diego Comicon were not possible

\-- “Virtual cons” in connection with Comicon in San Diego, New York, and Emerald City were successful in driving revenue increases

\-- Social media promotions helped drive increased engagement / awareness

\-- In lieu of attending New York Toy Fair, Funko decided to host its first ever virtual “Funko Fair” where they partnered with their licensors and retailers to engage fans and launch new offerings.

· The event was a big success leading to nearly 1.5 million units being pre-sold to fans through retail partners. Many of those items sold are still six to nine months away from being released.

· Funko launched “Funko Pop Albums” in 2020 where they release Pop! versions of classic album covers

o For example, the AC/DC’s classic “Black In Black” record was Funko’s top collectible item at one of their key mass market retailers

o Given the strong initial fan reaction, Funko plans to expand the concept across new genres including sports, trading cards, and comic book covers

MULTIPLE ANALYSTS INCREASE THEIR PRICE TARGETS

· Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng

o Raised the target price 130% to $15.30 (from $6.60)

o Q4 EBITDA beat expectations

o Impressed by Funko’s ability to pivot during the pandemic by leaning into e-commerce, games, and soft goods

· DA Davidson analyst Lind Bolton Weiser

o Raised the target price 142% to $17.00 (from $7.00)

o Boosting their modeled multiple to 17-times earnings (from 9-times earnings)

o Believes the company is returning to growth while improving its fundamentals

· Truist analyst Michael Swartz

o Raised the target price 38% to $18.00 (from $13.00)

o Funko reported a much better than anticipated Q4 and 2021 guidance

o Looks well positioned for the year ahead given the strong theatrical line-up, easy comps, product expansion initiatives, and the favorable impact of its high-growth DTC platform

· Piper Sandler analyst Erinn Murphy

o Raised the target price 46% to $22.00 (from $15.00)

o Strong Q4 results

===================================================================

*(At this point my post moves away from more traditional fundamental analysis / information towards more speculative types of things. While I do not really understand the fascination with cryptos nor NFT’s themselves, I do recognize that valuations throughout financial markets have deviated significantly from how I might value them based on more traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios or discounted free-cash-flow. Obviously, Tesla, AMC, and GameStop are recent examples of this in the stock market. Crpytos, sports cards, and Pokemon cards are recent examples in other markets (where there isn’t really any cashflow or profit stream intrinsic to the underlying asset from which to determine value). So, if you decide to purchase the stock based on factors outside of fundamental analysis, like momentum and meme-ability, please make sure to position size and be careful. As they say, return-of-capital is just as important as return-on-capital. So, once you move away from fundamental analysis to determine entry and exit into a position, the decision becomes primarily one based on emotion and “gut feel.” Finally, here are two books that I recommend on understanding market bubbles.* [BOOK 1](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806)*.* [BOOK 2](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-History-Financial/dp/1137525754/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*. That’s all for my PSA. I’ll get off my soapbox now and go back to the DD. Thank you for reading. Obviously, the news today that Funko plans to enter the NFT marketplace soon is an important announcement. So any DD without incorporating NFT’s into it would clearly be incomplete.)*

===================================================================

FUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs “FAIRLY SOON”

There aren’t many publicly traded companies that I can think of at this point playing in the NFT space. You have companies like Square and Paypal getting into cryptos from traditional fintech. You have companies with a core business outside of cryptos like MicroStrategy and Tesla buying Bitcoin for their treasury. Then you have others like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust who were born from the crypto world. But there none I can think of that are tied directly to NFT’s right now other than Funko.

*(If you can think of any other publicly traded companies that have announced their intention to move into NFT’s, please post their names in the comments below. Thank you.)*

After today’s [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) with CEO Brian Mariotti (quote at the end of this section), Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights. As we have seen with many other crpyto-related stocks, a company’s share price can swing wildly on a small announcement and the volatility can be extreme. If Funko issues a press release or makes a formal announcement about a new NFT product, the share price could move quickly one way or the other. Because of this, there is clearly additional value beyond its core physical Pops and Loungefly businesses that could be added to Funko’s valuation.

I don’t even know how to begin to estimate the potential value of NFT’s on Funko’s stock price. So instead of doing that, I will try to provide some information and research on recent activity in the NFT space. Hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding whether you would like to incorporate NFT’s in the estimate of what you think Funko is worth.

Potential impact of NFT’s on Funko’s go-to-market strategy (speculating on how Funko MIGHT implement NFT’s to expand and reinforce their business model):

· Digital items have the ability to move globally in an instant; increasing the total addressable market. Both for Funko and for collectors.

o For Funko it allows them to sell into harder to reach markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. There are probably wealthy collectors in many countries that want to own Funko and Loungefly products, but don’t have immediate access.

o For collectors, it allows them to buy and sell digital items across the world instantly without having to wait on receiving a physical item. 

· All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT’s, Funko can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their business. When someone purchases a rare item, their NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain.

· NFT’s allow Funko to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items.

o There are many wealthy crypto investors that are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.

o Additionally, there are other investors that are not currently investing in cryptos and blockchain that might be interesting in a solution that merges a rare physical item with a rare digital NFT.

· NFT “artists” or “creators” can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, if Funko made an NFT and it was sold 20 times over the course of a year, a company Funko might collect a fee every time the NFT were sold (depending on how the system were structured).

o Funko NFTs could be sold directly to the consumer through Funko’s website or (what I think is more likely) through retail partners like GameStop, Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and other retailers looking to get in on the NFT craze.

Quote from Funko’s CEO [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) about NFT’s:

“We’re excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we’re going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT’s to our fan base and link NFT’s with physical products. And that’s not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT’s. I won’t mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we’re going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That’s disruptive. That’s new. It’s different. It’s only what Funko can do. And we’re really excited about what the future of NFT’s are. We’re certainly all over this. And I think you’ll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.”

TL;DR:

As expected, Funko had a strong Q4 2020, driven by continued strength in their core product line and e-commerce sales in the US market. Funko’s sales are expected to continue to grow in 2021 as the company builds upon its wins from the second half of 2020. Funko’s international business represents an area of additional opportunity as the company has not fully recovered from sales declines in the region yet. Continued development of Funko’s direct-to-consumer initiatives in Europe along with store reopenings after lockdowns should remedy this.

While Funko has not formally announced their entry into the NFT market with a press release, thier CEO's interview with Yahoo Finance suggests that the company soon will. Funko announcing their entry into NFT’s would probably drive more attention to the stock and more investors to Funko products. At that point Funko would become more than just a “toy company.” They would become a collectibles company making products for the NFT marketplace. Many products made by Funko already command a significant premium in the secondary market. (Some examples: [Disney Bag 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Disney-Cast-Member-Exclusive-LE-600-Mickey-90th-Anniversary-Loungefly-Backpack/353336689947?hash=item524482051b:g:hj4AAOSwTu9fyDep), [Disney Bag 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NWT-Disney-Loungefly-Sleeping-Beauty-DEC-Employee-Backpack/373488324364?hash=item56f5a38f0c:g:eWIAAOSw3qVgRW30), [Funko 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-Freddy-Bloody-leatherface-POP-Exclusive-12-PIECES-EXTREMELY-RARE/143968624938?hash=item218532e12a:g:RgIAAOSwEiNgQco-), [Funko 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FUNKO-Pop-Games-Fortnite-VALOR-463-Vinyl-Figure-NIB/392842180285?epid=15027456221&hash=item5b7737f6bd:g:wRMAAOSwc7Ve6lE9), [Funko 3](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-POP-Star-Wars-Holographic-Darth-Maul-SDCC-480pcs/133480926875?hash=item1f14154e9b:g:JjMAAOSwfYpfJMGL)). Imagine what could happen to prices if those same products were combined with accompanying NFTs. This new opportunity with NFT’s provides optionality on an already stable core business of collectible toys, games, and merchandise.

Say your 18/19 with a part time job (assuming your in school) GROW YOUR MONEY. I am 100% not saying gamble in stocks like GME, AMC, etc. but really invest your money in strong fundamentally stable stocks, or ETF’s if you want to play it more safe, because in the next 3, 4, 5 years of your life your not going to have that money to play with. Bills will eventually start to pile up so get started sooner then later!

Stocks were up in premarket trading, but now we are looking at a bit of a mixed open. SPY is currently trading at just under 394, and given that we are still hovering near ATH levels, there could be some choppiness this morning. I'll be keeping an eye on UVXY to play any volatility we may see. Hopefully that won't be needed and we see another strong day in the market. Bitcoin is pulling back a bit this morning, after pushing to new ATH this weekend, and currently is trading around 56,000. Government officials in India appear to be working on a law to ban cryptocurrencies, so this will be important to follow. Bitcoin-related stocks are trending down in premarket trading, but I'll still be keeping a close eye on these today. Gold and silver are both up at the moment, and oil is slightly in the red. GME is currently up in premarket, and I'll be watching it throughout the week as there should be more volatility.

Remember to use proper risk management, make sure you size appropriately for your account, and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-03-15 08:52:56

Not many earnings reports being released so my focus will be on the few that are released and recent momentum stocks following trends and stocks that I have identified this weekend and strong.

601,$BB 3/15/2021 - Healthy Retracement,"Good day, everyone!  


This is a cross-over of my previous post. If you missed it, here's the link on r/stocks  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb\_this\_weeks\_recap\_3122021\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/)  


This is a healthy retracement, we were not respecting the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour and hourly chart, and were in the overbought territory on the RSI. Everything else is falling into place, we are looking good.  


Although I myself was excited to see $BB in the $12 range premarket and in the morning, I myself was wondering if we were about to see a blow-off, it looks like AMC ruled the day today.    


Average volume daily today too which is nice to see, probably some profit-taking as we are up 40% from the bottom at 8.83 which is fine by me. People can take their pennies if they wish, I'm more into the long game and swing trading ain't really my jam.

Continue accumulating and holding, we are looking extremely strong and this pullback was very very healthy.   


From all aspects of technical analysis standpoint, this is an absolute screaming buy.  
From a fundamentalist's view, those who know the sentiment, the deals, the products, and the history, this is a screaming buy.  
From a speculatory view or the ultra-long like 2-3 years down the road, this is a screaming buy.  


Think of this stock as smoking a brisket or making a nice prime rib roast. We want this baby to cook low and slow, or in another way set it and forget. If you do that you'll get the tastiest, juiciest reward.   


Take care.",2021-03-15 16:11:53
602,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 15, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks rallied on Monday after a choppy day, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) closing at new record levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered some lost ground as market participants continue to balance optimism regarding economic growth against rising Treasury yields.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to hover near one-year highs at 1.607%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, “The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.” 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital in order to fuel their growth and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

In other news, Novavax (NVAX) recently announced [drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.

604,The effect of options on stock price $TRVG $AMC $GME,"&#x200B;

Hello there!

I am fascinated by the pop in share price today for a number of secondary (meaning not GME) WSB and Reddit companies recently.

I am a shareholder and also hold a number of call options in TRVG, which is really taking off and which I will use as an example. While I am not surprised it is taking off, considering it is a strong reopening play with significantly improved finances, and since it is also a likely beneficiary of EU regulation aimed at Google, I am curious about why the momentum is building right now, considering there isn't much news or much happening. Since reading the linked article about GME, though, I have developed a belief that the principle reason could be March 19 options sold in January and February which are being covered, and that as this week goes on, we can expect the price to continue to rise since both the $2.50 and $5.00 call strikes are now in the money, and I am wondering what will happen if $7.50 comes into the money too, which I think is likely.

Now, I am a moron, and the above could be completely moronic, cause we morons gotta moron, but TRVG is my baby and I want to see my baby grow up to marry a rich doctor.

Also, in support of this idea, AMC and SNDL surged too, though SNDL probably surged because New Yorkers are hoping to legally get high.

Anyway, thoughts?

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks. Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management.

**Stocks Over $10**

* Gapping UP: ANVS, KMPH, FTCV, FUTU, BEKE, GRWG, CCIV
* Gapping DOWN: MARA, RIOT, CAN, GME, AMC, CLSK, FCEL

**Stocks Under $10**

1. CANF: Leading gapper this morning but couldn't find a catalyst for today. Seeing strong volume and price action in the premarket. Just be cautious and don't chase trades, as this could get a bit extended. 
2. SVRA: Gapping up after closing public offering yesterday, as well as a price target upgrade. Seeing decent volume and okay price action in the premarket. Seems to have found premarket support at 2.14.
3. WIMI: Gapping up on a couple different news catalysts. I'll want to see volume pick up a bit more. 
4. AZRX: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday, as well as a news catalyst. Seeing decent volume in premarket, but I'll want to see it pick up a bit.
5. ENZ: Gapping up after earnings/guidance. Price action showing some weakness at the moment, I'll want it to show some strength. 
6. XNET: Gapping up after reporting earnings. Seeing some weakness in price action at the moment, so I'll want to see this trend reverse.

Stocks are looking at a mixed open, but green overall. SPY is trading just below 397, and we could see a further push to new ATH. I'll be watching UVXY to play any volatility we may see. After seeing a bigger pullback yesterday, Bitcoin is currently trading at 54,900. Bitcoin-related stocks are down in premarket, and I'll be following them throughout the day. Tech stocks are doing well in premarket, and should see strength during the day if the market doesn't roll over. There weren't a whole lot of opportunities on the small caps watchlist yesterday. **Don't feel the need to force trades**. There will always be another opportunity. There is nothing wrong with sitting back and watching, and maybe running your stock screener again in 10 minutes or so. We need to be disciplined in our trading, and trading off your emotions is not disciplined.

607,AMC Apedate (Update),"Welcome back Apes.

(upvote, comment so everyone sees Apedate!)
We have seen some rising volatility the last days, which we love. But there is one very interesting fact. 

**Fact 1:** Last Friday the GME &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; AMC stocks formed a new dip, which all of us apes bought instantly. Do you remember the time the shittingers started dipping and halting the stocks? No ... WELL I DO! It was excactly 12:20 when the shitters shitstorm started shitting.


**Fact 2:** Yesterday was the same thing going on. Shitters formed an new bottom dip, for us to buy, and we love them because of that ❤️. The interesting thing here is, that the shitting and dipping and halting started at 12:20!

**Conclusion**: WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE?! Yeahh... not excatly. We would like to call it here shitter’s market manipulation.

SSR has been triggered for the last trading days, which helped us to form an strong support at 13$. Anyway let’s start with the premarket update

**Pre market Update 09:02**: Germany is proudly hodling the support line which has formed the last few days between 13.10$-13.40$. We shall aid them in 28 Minutes when the stock exhange officialy opens. 

Stocks available to short: 650.000
Current Stock Price: 13.46$

**Update 09:31:** Stock opens with 13.45$ and instanlt plumets down to 13.3$. We will have to fight at the support Line until we get some buying power rolling.

Stocks available to short: 650.000 (unchanged)
Current Price: 13.35$

Stocks available to short dropped from 1,100,000 to 650.000 which explains the dip. Buy the dip apes!

**Update 10:02:** Them Shitters used around 50.000 short stocks, that’s why we see our resistance getting tested all the time. We should be up abd running in the next 1-2 Hours. 14$ isn’t far away until than.

**Update 10:10:** We touched 12.50$ and jumped right back to our support at 13$,
I’m sure we have quite few diamond hands holding there, good job. Anyway we had some massive volume at starting 30 Minutes, around 1 Million! The way back to 14$ shouldn’t be too hard with all those stimulus checks incoming, I guess! Buy the FKN DIP until it ain’t too late! 

Current Price: 13$
Shares available to borrow: 750.000

**Update 11:03:** The dip stopped dipping. Last chance to buy some stonks. No seriously, we shall see some upward movement from here (12.74$). AMC is very likely gonna follow GME (which madd +10% in like 10 Minutes 🚀). 
Anyway there is also bad news which actually is good news: The shitters have topped up their “borrowable-shares” it’s sitting right now at 4.600.000 !!!! ... They could short the fuck out of us now and i would Love if that happens, because than .... THAN THEY WILL LOSE EVEN MORE MONEY once the 🚀 starts off to the 🌚 

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current stock price: 12.94$

**Update 11:12:** Im gonna predict something. Today at exactly some seconds before 12:20, we will see a massive Stonk Sell-Off from the Shitters, they will try and implement fear into us, but they won’t succeed.

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current price: 13.13$ &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;— is the stock price trying to tell us something? ... 13k13 which means 13.130!!!

**Update 12:03**
1.5 Million NEW shorts available which means there are now 6.100.000 Shorts available to the HFuckers. Wow, that’s gonna be a bloodbath in some days, be ready for Impact any day and show them what diamond hands are made from. 
Our support line moves diagonally down which means, it is not anymore at 13, but moved rather down to 12.4-12.6$. As long as we dont lose that 
Support today we should see some upward movement ... if HFuckers dont manipulate the market at 12:20 like yesterday.

Currently available shorts: 6.100.000 ... seriously.
Current Price: 12.69 (well ... at this point you should tell your wifes boyfriend that amc said its 69 time)

**Update 12:08**
The short borrowing Fee has massively decreased. It was 3 working days ago at 8%, now it is sitting at 1.8%. This is only embracing the fact that they are scared from our diamond hands and are preparing the next market manipulation.

**Update 12:20**
HedgieFuzzers have decided to not launch they’re massive attack Today. They are probably stocking their positions up. But i’m sure we will see the attack in the next days (Before we can see again daily profits of 30-50%)

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.50$

**Update 12:21**
What is interesting here is, is the stock dynamic which upped the AMC price from 12.5$ up to 12.75 in under 2 Minutes.

Shorts available: 6.100.000 ... Fee changed from 1.8% to 1.7%
Current Price: 12.75

**Update 13:01**
AMC is slowly refuelling it’s motors and starting to scratch at 12.83 resistance. If we get rejected from this resistance , than an double top scenario could occur, which would push the price as low as to 12.50 (where also our support is). Time will tell.
Besides that not much has happened.

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.8$

**Update 13:05**
It seems that we will break the 12.83$ resistance. Keep up diamond habds and buy the dip!
We also have an inversed head &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; shoulders to assist us in the push to 13$. 

**Update 13:55**
We have barricaded ourselves at 13$ and aren’t planning on giving that mark away to the hedgies! 
The next mark is around 13.6-14$. 
Anyway i have discovered something very mysterious. The available short stocks has decreased by 100.000. From 6.1mil to 6.0mil. Apes, all of you know what that means ... \*apes nodding their head\*
... and if not ill tell you ... \*apes breathe eases\*.
This means the HedgeFuckers are preparing to decrease the stock price again, with my prediction being an mix between closing long positions and short attacking (SSR is enabled so this won’t be very successfull, unless they manipulate the market again.). We should see attacks dropping the amc stock, when it starts scratching 14.10$.

Shorts available currently: 6.000.000
Price Currently: 13.15

**Update 14:18**
Still very quiet. Amc is preparing for the fight with resistance at 13.5-13.6$, once we break it we shall have a smooth ride to 14$.

Shorts available: 6.1mil
Current Price: 13.3$

**Update 14:30** 
Shitters are making their moves again. See how the stock dropped 0.40$ unnormaly while being in an natural up movement supported by double buttom + inversed head ans shoulders and some 🦍 Ape checks (stimulus). We should drop im the next minutes to 12.8$-12.9$ before our rocket refules for taking on the 14$ mark. 

Shorts available: 6.1mil
Price: 13.02$

**Update: 14:52**
Apparently we have failed the double bottom + inversed head and shoulders climb. But domething even better is coming up: rising wedge and the 5th leg are those 12.8$ where we are hovering right now. The 6th leg could catapult us to 14$! 

Current Price: hovering at 12.8$ and building up 5th leg

**Update 14:57**
Quick uodate on shorts available. The shitteres decreased available shorts by 200.000! Watch out for some massive barrier at 14$ or maybe even at 13.4$
Did they allready use those 200.000 shorts? Probably not, but they reserved them so to say.

**Update Hoodie** So i have been trying to guess some coupon codes on that shop below and it seems as they have made an *Easter egg** with the hidden code: **diamondhands**
It will give you an discount if you order something
Don’t believe me? Go and try it 🦍🚀

Warning: I hope my boss doesn’t ask me why i am taking regular shits every 1 hour ... 🚀

**And I’m making an giveaway for BUY THE FKN DIP!** ... APES since we are currently in a dip i will gift [this Hoodie](https://apemerch.com/product/buy-the-fkn-dip-hoodie) to one comment  if AMC reaches 16$ EOD! Cause i fkin love the stonk and made allready double my initial investment back! 🚀🥵

608,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. 

Retail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. 

In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. 

With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.”

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

611,DD With the Gamestonk Terminal,"Hello Fellow Apes,

A few days ago I saw this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/lrndzi/cant_afford_the_bloomberg_terminal_no_worries_i/) by u/SexyYear, he created his own Bloomberg Terminal called the GameStonk terminal. I bet some of you apes are too busy eating crayons or are too smooth brained to get this up and running on your own. So on behalf of you all, and your wife's boyfriend here is the DD that the GameStonk Terminal outputs for GME (from 2021-01-01).

**TL:DR  Fucking long post, with just a random bunch of graphs related to GME. Draw your own conclusions. Taken from SexyYears computer program. Not financial advice. 🍌 🛫**

# First up: what does the GameStonk Terminal do

* \- Discover Trending Stocks -  maps, high short interest etc.
* \- Papermill menu - to generate reports
* \- Sentiment analysis - from Reddit, Stocktwits and Twitter
* \- Economic Data - (Federal Reserve bank of st. Louis)
* \- Research web page - MarcoAxis, yahoo Finance, Fool
* \- Comparison Analysis - Historical data, Correlation and financials
* \- Fundamental Analysis  - Income, balance Cash, Earnings
* \- Technical Analysis - EMA, MACD, RSI, ADX, brands, obv
* \- in-depth due-diligence - news, analyst, shorts, insider, sec
* \- Prediction techniques  - regression, Arima, RNN, LSTM, Prophetit pulls most of it's data from open API's

# What I'll look into for now:

(let me know if you guys want more of this)

* \- A papermill report for GME- Sentiment of the Market for GME
* \- Comparison Analysis --> Comparing GME to similar companies and correlating ones
* \- Technical Analysis --> Some sweet graphs
* \- Due Dilligence- Prediction --> Price predictions using different Machine learning models

The other parts, are just API's (Like the Yahoo Finance API) returning information that you apes can easily google yourself, but again let me know if you want more.

Ok, ready: here we go!

# 1/6 Let's start with a Papermill report for GME

**6/6 Last but not least: Prediction -  Price predictions using different Machine learning models**

For the Machine learning models I set the data range to 2020-01-01 where needed. This allows for more testdata to train the model on, unfortunately the models are not perfect and thus easily confused by spikes, and drops. Just don't call me a shill if a AI decides that GME does not go to the moon (because we all know it will go to the moon🚀)

612,"Morning Update for Thursday, 03/18/21","Good morning everyone, happy Thursday. 

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks. Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management.

**Stocks Over $10**

* Gapping UP: TKAT, UPST, WSM, SINO, AYTU, OCG, LAZR, GME, AMC
* Gapping DOWN: MARA, RIOT, EBON, TBIO, RIDE, NIO, TSLA, MAXR

**Stocks Under $10**

1. NEOS: Gapping up after merging with AYTU, couldn't find anything else. Seeing good volume and price action in premarket. 
2. BHTG: Gapping up on news of expanded partnership. Seeing good volume, but currently seeing weakness in price action and I'll want to see that change.
3. EVOL: Gapping up after reporting earnings. Seeing a bit of weakness in price action, and I'll want to see that change. Very low float, so this could see some volatility this morning. 
4. UONE: Gapping up after reporting earnings. Also currently seeing some weakness in price action, but I'll be watching to see if that changes. 
5. CANF: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst. Seeing decent volume and price action in premarket. Has gapped up the past couple days of trading and is once again today, so I'm just keeping an eye on it. 
6. INFI: Gapping up after a couple price target upgrades and reporting earnings yesterday. Seeing decent price action but on lower volume. I'll want to see volume pick up.

After the strong afternoon yesterday, we are looking at opening in the red this morning. SPY is currently trading at a little under 395, and we could see some choppiness this morning. If SPY can't hold above 394, we could see some downwards movement today. Bitcoin pulling back slightly, trading at around 58,000. Bitcoin-related stocks are down in premarket, but I'll be keeping an eye on them throughout the day, as usual. Tech continues its slide. Gold is trading flat, silver in the green, and oil in the red. It's been a choppy week so far, and we could see some more indecision in the market today. Things seemed pretty euphoric yesterday afternoon, so I'm going to be a bit cautious today. If we see obvious strength, then it will be business as usual.

Remember to use proper risk management, make sure you size appropriately for your account, and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-03-18 08:56:21

The price defense on this stock was resilient. No matter the volume or potential bullish indicators. This stock just refused to climb despite multiple attempts. Just look at the rather organic and healthy price action of the first 2 hours. Then suddenly a very artificial range of price of a stock that is so emotionally driven...

617,"The AMC Stock vote will be a resounding YES on the part of the Majority, and how it affects you. Read more inside.","So this isn't a new tactic by a long shot, and this has been around for ages, but it's time we talked about something that corporations and especially boards of directors and large fund managers use when shuffling corporate wealth and influence around during periods of restructuring.

The majority shareholders absolutely want the value of $AMC to go down. Why? They need to buy A WHOLE LOT OF IT.

Of course they know issuing more will devalue the shares significantly, but only for a very short period of time.

Welcome to a second type of short , the inside short. In order for a company to shore up it's own valuation, it will issue large amounts of it's own shares in order to lower it's own price per share. They will immediately snap these up in bulk to hold as much of the stake in the company as possible.

Here comes the fucky part... Ready? When they have these majority cheap shares, and the market is flooded with shares under value, they wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit. There's two things that happen here, there will be FUD, which leads to selloff, and there will be just plain more shares. They will snap up as much of these stocks as possible until things are normal again. This is called a Stock Buyback. That's when they issue what's called a stock reverse split.

The stock reverse split suddenly takes their 200 Million shares and turns it back into a reasonable 20 or even 5 million shares. The value stays the same, but the cost of owning just one share just became a little more difficult to pony up to. This means they maintain their status as majority shareholders, but they also cannot be taken out by a outside investor who is soaking up penny shares on the outside market. Consider that right now, you have a weighted vote in AMC. Now consider how much less of a influence your vote carries when your share count goes from 200 to just 50, or even 5. Sure it's worth the same amount of money, but it doesn't carry the same weight in the company. 200 Votes isn't the same as 5 votes. They've marginalized low end shareholders and shored their positions.

This is how companies control board room decisions and how they ensure that control over corporate direction is firmly in the hands of the people they decide they want it to be. You can't trickle your way into a deciding factor in a major shareholder vote. You are either in the money, or you're left out in the rain.

Edit:

Everyone should remember that a LONG position on this stock may be the best position to take on this. It's not that the stock is doomed, but the MOASS is probably doomed for sure.

AMC saw what happened to GME. They are not in a position to accept becoming the next volatility stock. They're literally opening their doors this weekend. They are not in a position to become a meme when they are about to stabilize their business for the first time after a complete year of lockdowns and shutdown businesses.

Thanks for the Silver. This was my DD. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk: Note. None of this is financial advice. Almost all of us, including me are literally cats.

Edit 2 :

So lets talk volume. This is what becomes the most important. I THINK this is what most people fail to grasp. You own 5000 shares out of 1 million, but 10 million come up tomorrow. You are now swimming in a much larger sea. Previously, you were, perhaps a middling to un-fuck-withable predator. Now the sea or lake as you would prefer has gotten much bigger. MUCH MUCH bigger. You are now much much smaller. In order to maintain your size, you must consume a lot more shares and, even though they come cheap, it will cost you that much more money to get back to your previous position. Now you need to own 500k shares JUST to be back to where you started. Growing bigger got much more expensive, and it gets more expensive as the company continues to do well. The longer you wait to get into the pool, the more it costs you.

This is why they issue more shares and eventually why they drain the pool when they are satisfied with what is available.  


Edit 3 :  


So some of you have talked about a share count or what is considered a round robin. THAT WOULD BE GLORIOUS. I would probably be set to make a untold massive amount of money since the MOASS would almost trigger immediately. All things considered, either scenario I feel will be positive. AMC will not lose major value and the MOASS will not be a disaster for their volatility. They want to own their position, it's not really about saving the hedgies, it's about stability. As I've said to another poster, the problem isn't the way up, it's the way down. The down can land anywhere and they don't want to play the game on where it ends up. Right now they are on stable ground with stock and reopening. Meme stocking them right at this moment would be a disaster for their company when they are on opening week+(end)",2021-03-20 15:04:37

619,AMC why it's all good from friday's Quadruple witching hour.," 

Why we should be happy with Friday's AMC closing at 13.93. Wasn't AMC stuck at the $8 level just 2 weeks prior? If you were to ask me during the first week of March would I be happy to see AMC reach 12 and beyond by quadruple witching March 19, I'd be ecstatic if $14 can be established as the new base.

Here's why this $14 is a new base. Biggest white elephant in the AMC room was when Wanda Group converted all the [B shares to A](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). With about [44 million A common shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wanda-group-trimming-holdings-142528503.html) that you know Wanda is itching to cash out, Wanda Group was always a threat how they would be disposing of their shares. Well this Friday March 19, what many people did not notice was a flash block trade at 2 seconds after closing.

&#x200B;

[spot the elephant leaving the room?](https://preview.redd.it/qpq8gw220fo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ec9918d8b2e6340b425b769040f9a65ff9124403)

That's 45 million shares at 13.93 totaling $630 million. Ladies and gentlemen, Wanda has left the building. So we should be thankful that Wanda did not recklessly dump their shares in the market. Instead they found a banker or bankers to take up the entire 45M share quota. I'm guessing it's Goldman Sachs and B. Riley Securities since those two were of critical help during their [cash crisis in Nov last year](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-to-issue-20-million-shares-of-common-stock-61282394).

This share deal doesn't happen instantly, but takes days or weeks to negotiate. It's an educated but realistic guess that Wanda has been wanting to sell it shares and would be happy at a $15 range. Just follow Silverlake who also immediately on January 27 converted their [$600 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000119312521022799/d30907dsc13da.htm) debt into common share at 13.51 and immediately sold into the market starting at what price? 13.55 - 14.5 range then all the way up to $24. Don't know how they sold 200k shares at $24 but that's what is filed.

So Wanda wanted to follow Silverlake's lead but were just too late when they filed the papers to [convert on Feb1](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). Luckily they waited instead of just dumping, until AMC revived to above 10. By then they reached an agreement with bankers probably at $14. This is all guessing here and not established fact (except for that 45M block trade).

But if that's what happened, that's good for us because it means a big bank (Goldman? Riley?) is willing to take up a wholesale $630 million equity share position on AMC at 13.93 /share cost and will be retail selling these shares at 16 dollars and above? 18 dollars and above? 20 dollars and above? Once again based on Silverlake's move, they can see AMC going to 24 dollars.

If a deal was struck with Wanda at about $14, then it was imperative for them to make sure AMC stocks had to land at $14 dollars by end of Friday March 19. That's what we observed happening all day Friday trading.

If this is what happened, we should count ourselves fortunate because it's now a big banker who will be establishing $14 as the new base.

Go AMC, go Apes.

620,AMC; Fundamentals and the Long Term play," Hi everybody and thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. This DD will be dedicated to the long term growth potential of AMC and why I believe it is undervalued. As I was writing this, a lot has happened as such I will going through the mathematics and speculative valuation as well as in my opinion suspicious price action, as relevant to the long term potential of AMC currently; as well as try to reassure investors by clearing up a lot of the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) regarding the stock moving forward. All of this is my opinion, and my opinion alone of course, and not financial advice.

With that being stated; lets dive in:

This DD will be composed of the following sections:

i) Fundamentals

ii) Sentiment

iii) Momentum

iv) Consolidation

v) Future potential

vi) Bonus section: Connection to the Short Squeeze

\----FUNDAMENTALS----

So, let's begin with AMC's history:

AMC is a 100 year old company that is deeply embedded into American culture. Entertainment, movies and outings with friends and family has always been a top priority for people (globally). Making an investment into the nations largest theater chain is a bullish and potentially a highly profitable investment. Founded in the 1920s, out of Kansas, AMC offered its first IPO in the 80s which kick-started its growth to become Americas largest theater chain to this day. The price for AMC began to become undervalued in 2012, and as such sensing an opportunity Wanda ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda\_Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Group)) bought a majority stake in AMC, making Wanda the largest theater chain in the world. As such, AMC became a very stable company with a natural bullish outlook with major blue chip investors having large stakes in the company. Furthermore in 2016, Adam Aron was appointed the CEO in January and by May made moves to successfully acquire AMC's largest competitor Carmike Cinemas, successfully integrating it into the company and thereby cementing it at America's largest theater chain. In September of 2018, Silver Lakes Investments made a 600 mill investment into AMC, buying back approximately 32% of Wanda Group's class B common stock. Wanda continues to this day to hold the majority on the board of directors though. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC\_Theatres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres))

In October of 2019 AMC began its streaming service to compete with Netflix and co by starting to rent out films and even offering digital purchases via AMC Theatres On Demand. Just shortly after the premiere rumors of a new virus began to circulate in Wuhan in late November. The plague then hit America during February with the first cases, and by March the country was shut down and AMC had 0 in income coming from all theaters. Despite their core business grinding to a halt AMC raised almost over 2.2 billion dollars to my knowledge to date to stave off bankruptcy, as confirmed by the CEO ([http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/?co=AMC](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/?co=AMC)).

Additional sources, documenting cash raising throughout the year are given below:

([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/amc-hopes-to-raise-125-million-in-fresh-funding-round-as-it-fights-bankruptcy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/amc-hopes-to-raise-125-million-in-fresh-funding-round-as-it-fights-bankruptcy.html),

[https://deadline.com/2020/12/amc-entertainment-sell-200-million-shares-to-raise-cash-survive-covid-19-1234640183/](https://deadline.com/2020/12/amc-entertainment-sell-200-million-shares-to-raise-cash-survive-covid-19-1234640183/),

[https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-raises-cash-to-stave-off-bankruptcy-today-the-sun-is-shining-for-amc-ceo-1234679592/](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-raises-cash-to-stave-off-bankruptcy-today-the-sun-is-shining-for-amc-ceo-1234679592/))

AMC has completely avoided bankruptcy which should conclude its all-time low share price phase. Furthermore, it must be noted the CEO Adam Aron, has been quite skilled at handling crisis after crisis for AMC, whether its keeping AMC relevant despite pressure from streaming services or surviving a pandemic. The current CEO is a big part of why I believe AMC has immense growth potential. In addition to that the potential revenue from postponed blockbuster like Top Gun Maverick or Marvel movie releases from the beginning of 2020 up until now offers great potential for a post-covid recovery play. Even now relatively small releases such as Tom and Jerry see theatres filled to the legal capacity.

Due to my findings, I believe AMC has rock solid fundamentals of being profitable in addition to a time tested historical track record of being at minimum self sustaining regardless of negative historical events. Like America, it can bounce back from multiple crises better than before.

\-------SENTIMENT--------

At the time of writing, AMC has become a favorite of the average retail investor and the wallstreetbets ""movement"", as such the buying pressure on AMC is quite high; this can be seen from AMCs buy to sell ratio, which sits right now at 92:8. It usually fluctuates from 98:2 to 90:10 at any given time, depending on the volatility of the stock ([https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price](https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price)). Over the past two months, AMC shareholders refused to sell despite high volatility, which usually indicates strong belief in the fundamentals. Furthermore, institutional ownership has been skyrocketing with the quarterly inflow of this year being 98M compared to 1.51M in outflow ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/)).

Current public sentiment is that AMC is a sure-fire hit, just waiting for launch on both retail and institutional side with Vanguard and BlackRock being the most prominent recent investors. As traditional long-term investors, both companies likely believe that the stock is undervalued, making it an excellent time to take a stake for long-term value increase. ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/), [https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lxecfu/the\_institutional\_investors\_in\_both\_gme\_and\_amc/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lxecfu/the_institutional_investors_in_both_gme_and_amc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)).

The compounding effect of higher and higher prices contributes to the bullish sentiment supported by brokerages like fidelity which predict AMC could go up to 1.1k by September ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity\_algorithm\_predicting\_possibility\_of\_amc/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity_algorithm_predicting_possibility_of_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)). The price momentum of a stock is defined by the sentiment and fundamentals of the company it represents. AMC has a combination of strong fundamental value with a strong Bullish sentiment. This is due to a high investment volume which grows day by day. During this pandemic, AMC's resiliency and successful battle to avoid bankruptcy encourages an extremely bullish price momentum. Evidence for this lies in the stock price increase from 5.50 to 14+ USD over a span of one month reflecting a price increase of 154%. Furthermore, reliable sources report a strong buy indicator and other competitors in the theatre industry have smaller market cap and market shares indicate a higher growth potential for AMC. Zachs for instance has rated it as a strong buy ([https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC), [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)).

\-----MOMENTUM-----

The price momentum of a stock is defined by the sentiment and fundamentals of the company it represents. AMC has a combination of strong fundamental value with a strong Bullish sentiment. This is due to a high investment volume which grows day by day. During this pandemic, AMC's resiliency and successful battle to avoid bankruptcy encourages an extremely bullish price momentum. Evidence for this lies in the stock price increase from 5.50 to 14+ USD over a span of one month reflecting a price increase of 154%. Furthermore, reliable sources report a strong buy indicator and other competitors in the theatre industry have smaller market cap and market shares indicate a higher growth potential for AMC. Zachs for instance has rated it as a strong buy ([https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC), [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)).

Furthermore if we look at AMC's competition like Cinemark [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNK/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNK/)), and Marcus ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCS/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCS/)), both of which are smaller companies by both market cap and market share, have a higher share price even if you account for the total amount of outstanding shares; thus indicating higher growth potential for AMC increasing the bullish momentum we've already seen.

As such to end this section off, I believe have proven that AMC's current share price is undervalued and if the projections of fidelity are to believed and the predicted share price is 1.1k+ with the current momentum and buying power ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity\_algorithm\_predicting\_possibility\_of\_amc/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity_algorithm_predicting_possibility_of_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)), this stock is heavily undervalued, which has been reflected in the recent price action. I believe will continue to rise until the free market finds the correct price again, continuing the bullish momentum.

\-----CONSOLIDATION-----

I'd argue the most important part of a stocks price movement is consolidation. The price consolidation of a stock is defined by the share price effectively finding support at a price point, where in which the price of the stock doesn't easily fall under for a certain period of time. The longer the floor lasts, the stronger the consolidation is generally speaking. In contrast a quick consolidation may indicate a bull run with the price dropping back down afterwards. Quick is of course relative to the volatility of the stock in question, with AMC being one of the most volatile of stocks over the last couple of months a steady increase in share price over the last couple of months could be considered a slow consolidation.

As the definition for consolidation has been established now, lets apply it to the price action for AMC. Using the last 3 sections of fundamentals, momentum and sentiment we can establish that AMC is currently looking for it's ""fair value"" on the stock market. The more consolidation occurs at higher and higher prices, the quicker the share price will rise and find new floors, as the free market tries to find the price for the stock and in my personal opinion it's not stopping anytime soon.

Furthermore, as more retail investors buy the stock, price volatility and volume will increase. With higher volume comes price consolidation which in turn increases the stock price over time. This increasing level of support also directly affects options as more options will expire in the money with each new price consolidation floor. With this additional buying pressure comes volatility that drives the price up, causing more options to expire in the money, shooting the price to new heights. This process will repeat in a positive feedback loop, until the free market/shareholders determines the price of the stock to be fairly valued.

Several companies experienced the same phenomenon like Tesla, Volkswagen and now AMC is currently in the middle of a comparable aggressive price growth feedback cycle.

\-----FUTURE POTENTIAL-----

Now lets cover the rumors of AMC being acquired by either Amazon, or Netflix ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-netflix-try-acquire-amc-120436878.html?guccounter=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-netflix-try-acquire-amc-120436878.html?guccounter=1), [https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16408055/will-Amazon-or-netflix-buy-a-movie-theater-chain](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16408055/will-Amazon-or-netflix-buy-a-movie-theater-chain)). Lets start with Netflix:

A Netflix acquisition would be different in my opinion from Amazon. Netflix would turn into an extension of its movie network. Netflix has several storylines in development such as ""The Witcher"", ""The dark crystal: Age of resistance"", and ""the The Queen’s Gambit"" have quite high expectations; a more exhaustive list can be seen here: [https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/best-on-netflix/best-tv-on-netflix/#12-the-queen-s-gambit](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/best-on-netflix/best-tv-on-netflix/#12-the-queen-s-gambit).

Additionally, Netflix has multiple storylines in development such as Bombay Rose, Dealer, multiple Kdrama's, Get the Goat and other storylines ([https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-original-series-movies-tv-shows-coming-in-2021](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-original-series-movies-tv-shows-coming-in-2021), [https://www.buzzfeed.com/emlyntravis/best-k-dramas-tv-shows-movies-on-netflix](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emlyntravis/best-k-dramas-tv-shows-movies-on-netflix)) which will affect Netflix's market value in a positive manner.

Now, that the value of Netflix has been established, I'd like to run a thought experiment regarding the value of Netflix if it acquires AMC, and how the value of Netflix would increase and how if a retail investor (this is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, just a speculative case study) took a position in AMC currently at its undervalued state, how the retail investor could have the value of his/her position increase overtime in the event of a Netflix acquisition.

Netflix's valuation will increase if they had the largest American cinema chain on top of their entertainment production business. This provides a bigger platform for their entertainment to not only a larger audience, but also adding value to their existing customer base. This in turn, increases the position value of their shareholders. As such, in the case where AMC is acquired by Netflix, I believe the value of the positions in AMC/NFLX will increase. In the context of this thought experiment, as such the result of this thought experiment would be that AMC is currently undervalued in this hypothetical scenario. The value addition to AMC would handsomely reward AMC shareholders and thus would be a good investment (This is not financial advice).

Secondly, let's address the other scenario of acquisition, the Amazon deal. My understanding, many of Amazon's institutional buyers have bought into this; I'll post the source for verification: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/). As such rumors on an Amazon acquisition are not unfounded. I believe this deal will be similar to the deal with ""Whole Foods Market"" ([https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/a-year-after-Amazon-announced-whole-foods-deal-heres-where-we-stand.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/a-year-after-Amazon-announced-whole-foods-deal-heres-where-we-stand.html)), and AMC will become a part of the Amazon ecosystem, with Amazon Prime members having value added to their existing plans. As we've seen with Whole Foods, prior to the acquisition,

Whole Foods Market was receding in a bad market position, losing market share left and right to competitors. However, after the deal with Amazon, Whole Foods Market went through a mini-financial revolution where it was able to re-acquire its original market share. This was done by Whole Foods Market getting access to 2 things Amazon brought to the table: its internet infrastructure and its customer base, as well as immense liquidity of Amazon. This allowed Whole Foods Market to quickly gain back market share; as well as innovate their business. This was done by utilizing Amazon's platforms to increase cost effectiveness. In relation to their business model they increased profits, which allowed them to expand their business, and take back market share at the expense of their competitors. Furthermore, this allowed Whole Foods Market to go from a regional distributor of organic produce to a national grocery chain specializing in organic foods.

This was done, in my opinion, by utilizing Amazon's data-centric business model. Whole Foods Market was quickly able to identify market inefficiencies and use them to gain back market share, while increasing value provided to the customer. This was accomplished through innovation and new business practices, such as faster and more centralized delivery, data intensive business planning, etc. Lastly, Whole Foods Market was able to prove there was a market place for organic fresh foods within an extremely competitive market environment by effectively using the Amazon playbook in the grocery space. In doing so, they took back their market share at the expense of profit.

I believe if AMC were to be acquired by Amazon, it would be a comparable play from there on; i.e. the gaining of market share at the expense of their competitors. They would be introducing new business methods to add value to their customers and shareholders using big data. This can be done in several ways: Amazon may utilize the Netflix model as previously proposed. This can be done by simply substituting Netflix production, development and licensed storylines model with an Amazon Prime one. Amazon Prime has original shows like ""The Expanse"" as well, as well as licensed, developing content like ""Vinland Saga"", ""Attack on Titan"" and ""The Boys"". Sources for Prime video shows are as follows:

i) [https://reelgood.com/tv/source/Amazon](https://reelgood.com/tv/source/Amazon)

ii) [https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-Amazon-prime-original-series-ranked](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-Amazon-prime-original-series-ranked)

iii) [https://decider.com/article/new-on-Amazon-prime/](https://decider.com/article/new-on-Amazon-prime/)

Furthermore, as shown with Whole Foods Market, Amazon likes to integrate new acquisition into its ecosystem. In addition to the Netflix replacement deal, AMC customers will be offered further value that will enhance AMC's products such as family and friend bonding time as well as entertainment. This could be done in several ways, in addition to Amazon 5 star restaurants being set up within the cinemas, additional merchandizing rights, prime member discounts, centralization of merchandize and concession stands resulting in, I dare say, cheaper popcorn perhaps; the possibilities for growth are endless. As such, the Amazon scenario can, and I believe, have as much growth potential as the Netflix scenario.

The third scenario; is AMC rebuilding itself to compete with streaming services and offer a better service to its customers. This is also another profitable scenario. Right now AMC is the largest cinema chain in the country; with multiple accredited investors like BlackRock and Vanguard. Furthermore, they have 2.2 Billion cash as stated above; as such they have the ability to innovate without incurring debt. They also have a highly supportive shareholder and customer base, which means there will be strong and perpetual buying pressure. An increase in interest allows them to raise further capital as time progresses as the need arises for innovations. These innovations could be exploring Virtual Reality, or going with a hybrid formula similar to both Amazon's and Netflix's plan is completely up to AMC's shareholders and AMC's board of directors.

However, the purpose of this section was to show how AMC is not just a meme stock (it is, but it also in my opinion an undervalued stock, allowing potential buyers to generate value in their positions, at the current ask price); but an excellent long term hold. As such, I'd like to end this section by saying the following:

Throughout this section I explored the future growth potential of AMC; as such I believe whether it's acquired by a larger company, or forges its future itself, the stock is highly undervalued. The value of this stock will be not determined by any narratives; but by shareholders of AMC, as well as the business itself as it continues to generate revenue for its customers and shareholders.

\----Connection to the Short Squeeze----

This topic is unavoidable; as such I believe it should be addressed head on. As stated in the beginning of this article, this article has been dedicated to discussing the long-term growth prospects of AMC, and why I believe it has immense growth potential. This has been directly shown using mathematics, price and sentiment analysis, why this stock should grow naturally regardless of a short squeeze (to an extremely high price too according to fidelity). As such, this article is to help people who may be doubting their investment in AMC, due to all the fear, uncertainty and doubt regarding the stock; as such this article presents a long-term outlook on the hypothetical price action of AMC regardless of the squeeze.

Thus, hopefully, allows people to sleep better at night if they are holding AMC.

Now, lets talk about the squeeze that I know many of you may have on your minds; I stand by my words written here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m07hnz/the\_inevitability\_of\_amc\_2k\_based\_on\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m07hnz/the_inevitability_of_amc_2k_based_on_current/), I still believe the price floor for AMC being 2k, especially after the last 2 week's suspicious price actions. To say the least, we have cemented the floor more than ever (plus I said there will be massive FUD from AMC shorters and the Media going forward; one that comes to mind is Motley Fool for instance). However, I'm starting to lean towards the fact that the price floor must be much higher, due to this stock being manipulated at a higher rate (similar to synthetic CDO's back in 07/08 when the housing market exploded). This is still being researched, but I'll leave you guys with a couple sources in relation to GME;

Comments on GME trading halt and the hypothetical price if it wasn't halted:

Here's some proof that GME did almost hit 10k right before trading halts:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m858f7/amc\_robinhood\_hodlers\_you\_must\_turn\_off\_instant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m858f7/amc_robinhood_hodlers_you_must_turn_off_instant/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m383nu/short\_mr\_on\_amc\_200\_in\_questrade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m383nu/short_mr_on_amc_200_in_questrade/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l6y5rq/did\_we\_break\_gme\_9999\_on\_the\_ask\_and\_frozen\_on\_td/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l6y5rq/did_we_break_gme_9999_on_the_ask_and_frozen_on_td/reddit)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yas1/gme\_bidask\_hits\_limit\_in\_tda\_2509999/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yas1/gme_bidask_hits_limit_in_tda_2509999/)

Now within those links it shows that the margin requirement to short AMC is 200%, and GME was only at 120%; just based on the math, AMC can match if not exceed GME's initial non-halted squeeze of roughly 10k. However, I'm still working out all the math if 10k AMC is viable (I'm leaning to a yes so far though, but I'll keep you guys posted). So I'll be conservative and put the floor at 5k for now upon initial observations. Now, there still must be a lot of math to be worked out guys, so don't take it as straight facts. This is just initial speculation, but I believe the floor may be much higher in the case of a short squeeze at $5k ish. In addition, Fidelity's charts agree long-term this could be a $1.1k+ stock. So it's more than mathematically viable, as I have demonstrated in this article.

\-----Summation----

So to wrap it all up in a pretty bow, I believe the fundamentals, sentiment, momentum, consolidation and future potential of AMC, make it a very strong buy in my opinion.

This has not only been reflected by recent price action and an increase in buy volume, but also accompanied by main street sentiment towards AMC.

I believe this will continue until shareholders determine the value of AMC; thus satisfying the free markets quest to find the true price.

Finally, as customary within my articles, I'd like to leave an appropriate quote or two to summarize the article. Since this article is dedicated to the long-term price action and value of AMC, let's take today's quotes from the ancient past:

""Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed""- Heraclitus of Ephesus.

""It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light"" - Aristotle.

As the wise men of the past have indicated, value is not created over night, it takes patient and protracted effort to create and reward value, however the fruit of the labor is usually sweet; so I believe whenever the price is found for AMC, the shareholders will be rewarded by their patience and effort with sweet profit.

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on the price action of AMC, and its future prospects. I hope the rest of your day goes well and you are successful in your endeavors.

This of course is solely my opinion, and not financial advice.

\---TLDR---

For people who don't feel like reading, and apes; the article shows long-term you'll get profit/tendies of a price floor according to Fidelity of $1k+ minimum long-term, as such, if you continue to buy and hold; mathematically you will not only reach tendieland (high profit for those who don't speak wsb), but your tendies (profits) will be nice and crisp.",2021-03-22 04:43:21
621,"Morning Update for Monday, 03/22/21","Good morning everyone, I hope you had a nice, relaxing weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks. Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management.

**Large Cap Watchlist**

* Gapping UP: KSU, SNX, CUB, NIO, TSLA, CCIV, CHPT, GRWG, 
* Gapping DOWN: RLX, TKAT, OCG, AMC, CAN, CCL, SNAP

**Small Cap Watchlist**

1. SPRT: Gapping up on news of deal with bitcoin miner. Seeing strong volume and  price action in premarket, just be cautious as this could get over-extended. 
2. SNCA: Gapping up on news of terminating some executives in the company, couldn't find another catalyst. Seeing good volume in premarket, but showing some weakness in price action at the moment. 
3. CETX: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst. Seeing good volume and price action, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues. 
4. LODE: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst. Seeing okay volume and price action in premarket. The daily chart intrigues me so I'll be keeping an eye on LODE. 
5. DYAI: Gapping up on news of developing COVID vaccines for variants. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues. 
6. ORMP: Gapping up on news of development of single-dose oral COVID vaccine. Seeing low volume at the moment, but it's holding up at the moment. I'll want to see an increase in volume. 

The market is looking at a mixed open this Monday morning, maybe a bit in the green. SPY is trading at just above 390, and hopefully we see some upwards movement to start the week. We could also see some downwards movement if the movement to the upside fails, and I'll be keeping an eye on UVXY. Bitcoin is currently trading at 57,200 and hasn't had a lot of directional movement in the past few days of trading, we could be due for a big movement soon. Bitcoin-related stocks are mixed in premarket, but I'll be watching them throughout the day. Tech stocks are showing strength this morning, and I'll be following how these stocks trade today. EV stocks are also showing strength this morning after a couple weeks of weakness, and I'll be closely monitoring a few. We have seen some volatile intraday price swings recently, and I'll be expecting some more of that today. 

Just remember to use proper risk management, make sure you size appropriately for your account, and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-03-22 08:55:36
622,The Telehealth Underdog: AMWL Announcing Q4 Earnings This Week,"It’s the season for Q4 earnings announcements. One that I haven’t heard much hype about yet is Amwell, which is weird to me because it’s one of the country’s largest telehealth companies. I’ve had my eye on AMWL since it’s IPO in September of 2020. The stock debuted at $18, where it issued 41.2 million shares and raised $742 million. It’s had a 52-week high of $43. So, like most stocks in recent weeks, it’s dipped a bit as COVID vaccines increase and the long-awaited stimulus checks hit our accounts. I don’t know about you guys, but *all* of my tickers have seen some hella red the last few weeks. Okay, maybe not GME and AMC… but that’s not what this post is about (for once). Most of us anticipate the market picking up, so here’s an overview of AMWL’s performance last quarter and what I’m expecting to see in Wednesday’s Q4 earnings call. 

AMWL’s first earnings announcement since going public came out last year in September. The company reported $62.6 million in revenue for the third quarter—an 80% increase year over year from $34.7 million. The pandemic driving millions of Americans to telehealth caused revenue to nearly double from 2019. Revenue directly from visits totalled $28.5 million, a nearly 300% increase from last year. Total visits also increased 455% from Q3 of 2019, coming in at more than 1.4 million. This is a decent chunk of the market considering the millions of Americans that have used telehealth in 2020. I know I have. Research shows that telehealth visits were up 154% the last week of March 2020 compared to the same period the previous year.

Now that the hard numbers are out of the way, here’s qualitative data that makes AMWL appealing. On the Q3 earnings call, CFO Keith Richards said he expected to see the upward trend continue for the healthcare company. This is due to a few things: A $100 million investment from Google, the expected continued use of telehealth after the pandemic ends and a plan to develop innovative technologies for the healthcare industry. Already, AMWL has launched new solutions to integrate in provider’s systems, making telehealth easier and more accessible. These include Amwell Now, Touchpoint Tablet software, and the C500 telemedicine cart. This could poise AMWL as a leader in the healthcare technology industry at the perfect time. 

So, what do the analysts think? Currently, analyst ratings show 4 buy and 7 hold. However, with AMWL hitting one of the lowest dips right now since its IPO, I’m thinking now is the best time to buy. I am in no way a financial analyst, but IMO, it can only go up from here. The stock price target shows a high of $45, median of $33, and low of $27, indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. At $20, this stock is an absolute steal. Let’s consider the potential growth here. With analysts predicting these numbers, even the median estimate represents a more than 60% increase from the current price of $20.15. At their high prediction of $45 a share, it would be more than a 120% growth in the next 12 months. Researchers say that the financial value of telemedicine visits is expected to reach $106 billion by 2023, with up to $250 billion of the current U.S. healthcare spending eventually shifting to virtual. This is why I’m talking about it, so why isn’t anyone else?

Earnings and sales forecasts predict $54.6M in sales and $-0.25 earnings per share. Now, should we be alarmed by this? Maybe in other industries, but telehealth as a whole has struggled to be profitable. Telehealth beast Teledoc hasn’t yet turned a profit either, with both companies posting a net loss in Q3 of 2020. I think this is the nature of the game. Telehealth is a relatively new and innovative industry, which sees the ups and downs anticipated from disruptive stocks. 

TLDR. Though the industry struggles to be profitable yet, telehealth is the way of the future. The pandemic may end soon, but this will not be the end of innovative healthcare technology that provides greater access to healthcare for millions of Americans. TDOC isn’t the only big player here. AMWL is the underdog we all need to be looking at before Q4 earnings are announced on Wednesday.",2021-03-22 11:37:26
623,"ASO earnings, decent short interest","ASO has earnings on the 30th. Already have talked about expansion and there is a decent amount of short interest so if they beat, a nice continuation will follow. ASO IPOed in 2020 but they've been around for a long time. Reminds me of dick's, but they've been on the market for a while. ASO is based out of texas, and have stores all around that region of the US, so their brick-and-mortar stores haven't been hit as hard by the coronavirus shutdowns.

624,A Trade Idea and yesterdays NLS,"Before I post about today’s trade Idea, I would like to discuss yesterday’s NLS. The short term thesis on NLS has not changed.

**#1 The sophisticated seasoned trader/fund/that knows what they are doing (90%). Whoever entity or group decided at the open to short put options on NLS to the tune of 400,000 shares already had a short position. This purchase was over $66,000. Many people that buy puts also short the stock as well so that the put options will increase in value and vice versa. If they short this immediately after purchase of puts they will win with the stock as well as the options and many times will close out both positions. Why do I believe this possible? People that buy options dont normally put $66,000 on puts due with an expiration date of October 15th unless they know something or are about to do something. I havent traded options in years but ask anyone, putting $66,000 on 1 option with 1 date and 1 price is like buying $100 million of 1 stock. It is the actual equivalent of all eggs in 1 basket. Also, this was 20x the option activity on NLS. In fact, one of our members asked me today how come she could not buy immediate call options on NLS. I said it is likely market makers and underwriters do not see action in NLS to write so many options. So this option is 90% accurate. 20x normal volume, insanely high bet on 1 option at 1 strike price with no spreads, purchased within minutes at the open.**

**#2 The speculator, risk taker, who wants to gamble $66,000 on options for October 15th and says, eh... I just hope it goes down and wont do anything about it (10%) Anyone that trades options will be the very first one to tell you, there is no reason to buy an option with a future date, unless you believe something is going to happen, or will do something about it. Options only move when you are close to strike price or near the expiration date. This speculator or gambler, believes that the business will not sustain in the 3rd quarter. (I am not sure myself and worry 1 quarter at a time). Last year revenue was 551 million and the CEO has already had a forecast weeks ago that 1st quarter would grow 55-75%... Last week management had said revenues will hit 1 billion by 2023....I dont like rhetoric but that is reasonable even if business slows. If revenues grow 50% in 2021 we are looking $826 million for 2021. If we have 10% growth in 2022 we are at 910 million and thats with 10% growth... So I think they understand business would slow....However this speculator believes business will fall off a cliff... Why? Because at $12.50 the market cap will be $350 million. They made $40 million last quarter.... if they make even $50 million for 1st and 2nd combined and the stock is near $12.50 expect a bridge loan to go private, or a heavy buyback. No CEO is that dumb...and if they are hire me as CEO or CFO... So I hope it isnt option #2 just gambling their $66,000, and I hope they decide to close out their shorts.**

If it is option 1 or 2... either way short term it wont effect amazing execution at the company.... If the company starts failing later on, then we must worry. I do not like to hold stocks into earnings and rather pay more money when the coast is clear.... or have half a position. If it is my theory we have a concern and I am tweeting those 3 short firms right now.

Up Fintech – TIGR

This company is a Chinese brokerage that has grown revenues over 100% already by the 3rd quarter of 2020. The current market cap is close to 2.5 billion at a stock price near $18….. After the last report which was absolutely amazing this took off near 40…. What has changed since this last report? On 2/17/2021 the Singapore division reported 100% quarterly growth quarter over quarter. They have reported over 1 million members. (Interactive Brokers has about 1.1 Million, is private in the USA but estimated to be worth 10+ billion) I can tell you Interactive brokers isn’t even growing at 25% year over year even with GME and AMC WSB Fiasco.

The only negative I see with TIGR is that it is Chinese, and sometimes people are afraid to invest in an ADR/foreign company. If you see the sales growth year over year it has been indeed impressive. I am not crazy that the company is basically at a breakeven but for 100%+ growth it is worth it!

It is my belief someone is shorting heavy even since yesterday, as it was about $21 Monday before the open and now the bid is near $18 …. 15% drop when the Nasdaq was up 170 yesterday

Good luck everyone, let’s make money!

The only negative I see with TIGR is that it is Chinese, and sometimes people are afraid to invest in an ADR/foreign company. If you see the sales growth year over year it has been indeed impressive. I am not crazy that the company is basically at a breakeven but for 100%+ growth it is worth it!

It is my belief someone is shorting heavy even since yesterday, as it was about $21 Monday before the open and now the bid is near $18 …. 15% drop when the Nasdaq was up 170 yesterday

Good luck everyone, let’s make money!

626,"Morning Update for Tuesday, 03/23/21","Good morning everyone, and happy Tuesday. 

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks. Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management.

**Main Watchlist**

* Gapping UP: TSLA, TKAT, ORMP, MOGO, RUN, BLFS,
* Gapping DOWN: QS, IONS, JFIN, VIAC, MP, AMC, LI, XPEV

**Momentum Watchlist** 

1. BNTC (+137%): Couldn't find any catalysts. Seeing good volume and decent price action in premarket. Up big in premarket, so just be cautious as this could get over-extended. 
2. YVR (+16%): Announced closing of direct offering yesterday, couldn't find any other catalyst. Seeing decent volume and price action in premarket. Pretty low float, so this could see some volatility this morning. 
3. PED (+19%): Brought 2 new wells online, and sold non-core assets to raise cash. Seeing a revival in volume and price action at the moment, and I'll be watching to see if that continues. 
4. HOTH (+39%): Announced positive results for novel COVID therapeutic. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if that continues. Low float, so could see some volatility this morning. 
5. PSTV (+27%): Up on news of a deal for its brain cancer drug product. Currently seeing some weakness in premarket, and I'll want to see it get back above the 4.00 level to be interested in trading it. Also low float, so this could see some volatility this morning. 
6. LOTZ (+9%): Couldn't find a catalyst. Seeing good volume and price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues. 

**Market Outlook**

Stocks are looking at opening lower this morning, as traders await Fed Chair Jerome Powell's statements regarding the economic recovery. In other news, Germany extends its lockdown for another month. SPY is trading just below 392, and hopefully we see more strength in the market today. Bitcoin is currently trading at around 55,000, and I'll be watching Bitcoin-related stocks pretty closely throughout the day. Tech stocks are still showing strength relative to the rest of the market, so it's worth keeping an eye on them. Gold is trading flat, silver is down a bit, and oil is down over 3% at the moment. We are seeing some uncertainty in the market this morning, and we could see some choppiness. Remember to stay disciplined in your trading, and contain your emotions.

Just remember to use proper risk management, make sure you size appropriately for your account, and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2021-03-23 09:01:57

628,THE QQQ continues to trade in the same range for the past 10 out of 11 sessions ... sell premium,"03/25 Made final entry below with unrealized gains in the time line thread and that will conclude this post.

03/24 5:34pm .. THIS POST WAS INTENDED TO SHOW a trade idea that you can make some coin in a sideways market with little capital risked.  The enthusiasm and comments to help point me in the right direction have been overwhelming. What a great community! This went so well and I learnt so much. Doubt I ever need to post again. Hopefully some of you can post your trades for the week and we can all learn more from each other. It's a community and I can really feel it!

The market continues to prove it can be very violent and tricky with moves but the end result is the same. Continuing in a sideways move which benefits the sale of OPTIONS outside the range. Also, I'm selling options that expire FRIDAY on names that have high probability set ups and are near or well above MAXPAIN for Friday.  Another great day.

[QQQ DAILY ... I hava IRON CONDOR that expires FRIDAY and took out positions selling BEAR CALL SPREADS .. NTNX AA TSLA ETSY QQQ .. and cashed out the following BEAR SPREADS 1\/2 of TSLA, ALL AMC & RCL](https://preview.redd.it/np573eyt6uo61.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1f251f610661fc9a1a0f8f80281ceff9e143e2d)

&#x200B;

EDIT .. SOMEONE ASKED FOR MY STRIKES ON THE IRON CONDOR ...

Buy 322 Call -- early in the trading day YESTERDAY

Sell 320 Call

EDIT .. Doubled the above position when QQQ was at $320.60 as I saw the tape was weak for a move above resistance.

Buy 308 Put -- 44 minutes in

Sell 310 Put

EDIT .. Doubled this position when QQQ was at $320.20

EDIT 03-24 .. Took three $323-$324 Bearish Call spreads Yesterday when the QQQ was just under $321 ... I have this IRON CONDOR but I'm certainly net bearish. If I get more bearish I will position for gains to the downside. I could have made much more just shorting ETSY but capping gains also means limiting losses. Stocks can gap up, so shorting is more risky than this imo. The play I'm making here is to gain some profits with any move other than a big breakout above QQQ 321. Capping my risk in this sideways chop.  Stops are in, emotions are out.  Not even logged into my account today. Just going to let it all ride.

03-24 Just read, DOW RALLIES for re.opening hopes... Or is it because of this? [DIA Open Interest, Volume and Max Pain (maximum-pain.com)](http://maximum-pain.com/options/dia)  .. Interesting times.

03-24 Took a break to watch the closing bell. QQQ$313.25 really needs to hold based on my short term charts. So many stocks in a nose dive. If only I took a naked ITM put on ETSY lol.  I'm just too conservative right now. If we stay below $313.25 for too long I'll remove the bottom side of the Condor for a small loss and protect from taking away more profits .. See what the morning brings. Maybe we get something to calm the market, maybe the Fed Market Pump team steps in. Who knows. But, I'm net bearish so another winning week looks almost guaranteed. GME has easily cut through every support. Good luck trying to figure out where that one stops.

03-24 4:15pm E. ... Logged into account.  Got stopped out of the BULL PUT bottom half of this Condor. I got out of one yesterday at -30 and today at -59   +$364 on the day. So, I'm no longer counting on the bottom of this range to hold; But, still think some miracle will hold it up. So, everyone can stop posting that I'm taking too much risk and stops don't work :)

FINAL update... 03-25 8:35am .. closed my AA position and with the price action and getting stopped out of the lower section of this condor I remain bearish.  I'm now a net buyer of premium. These two trades made this A.M.  Next WEEK Expiry: Bought 301 and sold 284 QQQ Put (03-31 $1.12dr) ... Sold $40 and bought $43 NIO Call (04-01 $0.58cr) .. Both bearish trades.  Still trading small until we get confirmation of direction from this range bound QQQ. My account shows $578 unrealized and $31 realized gains at this time. So, if this remains the same as these positions expire worthless and my account is credited ... It will be a $1,500 week without being married to the screen. With IB , Stops do work with Liquid Options like QQQ ... On less than Liquid options I can not suggest trusting them due to slippage and spreads as suggested by many of the comments. Trading more liquid options allows you to have some freedom from your trading software should you take on trades like this. However, they should not be 100% counted. If I use them, it is for smaller positions. For me, larger positions require close monitoring when trading weekly options. Hope this has been helpful to some that are new to trading options. For those of you that are better traders than I. From the comments, it seems we have a few. Please do make some posts or your trade ideas so the community can grow stronger. Trading digits on a screen can get lonely sometimes especially if you are unsure how to proceed with a risk/reward strategy that suits your account. This concludes this post.

&#x200B;

Also, most my Bear Call spreads are $2 - $5. This is a low value strat. Not much money put in here. I'm not saying to go ""all in"" with the QQQ going sideways. A lot of you are saying Ima gonna blows up. However, I can't blows up even if everything goes 100% wrong. I'm fully hedged and have stops.

Boring gains but gains with lower risk: Mon +$205, Tues +$408 , Weds +$370 ... This is the first time this year that I've traded this strategy as the right set up has not presented itself until now. My other trades outside the Condor are pretty text book for me on a weekly basis.

[I'm not going to retire early but I'm not risking a lot in this chop as we all know that a trend lasts as long as it lasts .. stay safe.  I took profits on a couple. Once we break out of the range I will trade larger again.](https://preview.redd.it/3twawbu6uuo61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7099110a674efa97765b95a3320bb0ae7822ca8a)",2021-03-23 16:25:49
629,(3/24) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, March 24th, 2021-

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-intel-gamestop-viacomcbs-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to bounce after Tuesday’s broad sell-off

> * U.S. stock futures bounced Wednesday, especially Nasdaq futures, one day after a broad sell-off sent Wall Street lower. Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

*****

> # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

> * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

*****

> # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

> * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

> * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

*****

> # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with b/itcoin

> * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with b/itcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with B/itcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with b/itcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular c/ryptocurrency as a form of payment.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

630,2021 - The greatest year of Investing,"It's 2021 and the Corona virus is finally looking like it's coming to an end. A light at the end of a dark dark tunnel. This is terrible for investors. The economy opening up is the worst thing for businesses here in the year of our lord 2021. The best thing to happen to the market? A global pandemic that claimed the lives of millions and shut down the entire world. This was good for businesses and the economy. We all got rich except people who didn't believe tesla was worth a bazillion dollars. 

Our celebrity host president was amazing for our market, but someone with actual political background is horrific for the market. Biden needs to get a tan and hop on Twitter asap. 

 Stimulus. Well, stimulus was amazing for stocks, until the media decided it wasn't. Now it'd bad. Which brings us to inflation. One day treasury yeilds inching up a tad to expected levels is the scariest thing ever (oh my God! Inflation! Where did this alien thing come from and?!) and the worst thing to happen to tech in quite some time. What happens when those yeilds start to plummet? Oh it's also bad for tech. 

Fundamentally sound businesses are no longer worth investing in while GME and AMC are around - they are the best investments since Apple or Amazon. Amazing companies here in 2021. 

Oh and did I forget to mention semiconductors? This year has showed us that supply and demand is a Boomer metric that we should throw out. Massive global shortage of chips? Bad for chipmakers as there are way more demand for their products and less supply. This is obvious in modern day investing. What else am I missing? Can you guys name a few more?

What's next I must ask.",2021-03-24 22:29:02
631,Double leg 150% gain on volatile stock theory,"Hey all, I had a grand idea that feels fool proof to me and seems like guaranteed gains. Ofcourse I’m sure someone here’s tried something like this.

My strategy would be to pick 2 90 day options on a hyper volatile stock. One call one put with say 3 times leverage. Then set sell orders at 150% gain

Example. $1000 call $1000 put. Ones going to go green unless it just continually trades sideways . Then if you stock moves drastically up or down. I’ll sell whichever one at a 150% gain, then take the loss on the other one. I’m sure it’ll still have some value in it.

I’m guessing this sounds good on paper but doesn’t always work so smoothly.

633,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 25, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 25, 2021**

Stocks rose on Thursday, shaking off three consecutive days of losses in yet another volatile trading session. Market participants continue to monitor recent comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the Treasury yield, and the coronavirus situation in Europe. 

In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition Thursday morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency."" This is the latest in a long string of comments from Powell and other monetary officials, like Janet Yellen, that point to the maintenance of accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future. 

However, despite Powell’s consistency in his statements, many market participants continue to fear that coming inflationary pressures could cause the Fed to tighten monetary policy earlier than expected. Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo said, “This will be the first time that every country in the world is emerging from recession simultaneously. And the Fed and other policymakers are banking on this idea that it’ll be a relatively short strain on supply chains but eventually, things get up and running again and you can get the input components to where they’re most needed.” 

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to hover around 1.6%, falling from 1.75% earlier in the week. Despite the decline, the Treasury yield remains at elevated levels compared to 12 months ago, with the expectation that the yield will continue climbing as the economy reopens and recovers. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

We agree, rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Moreover, earlier in the week the, US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)).  In a late-night news release Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had analyzed more data from that study and concluded the vaccine is 76% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, instead of the 79% it had reported earlier in the week, [insisting the vaccine was “strongly effective” against the virus. ](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-strong-protection-us-rift-466726258e5e546550907f123f67763d)

635,StockPulse PulseBrief - Etruscus Resources - CSE:ETR / OTC: ETRUF,"Hello StocksAndTrading Community! I would Like to Introduce Myself, and most importantly, Etruscus Resources.

Ertuscus Resources is trades on the CSE under the ticker symbol ETR, and on the OTC Markets under the Ticker ETRUF. 

Etruscus Resources has not paid for this post, has not endorsed this post, and frankly, did not ask for this post. While I, nor StockPulse is not telling you to make a purchase of ETR/ETRUF's Stock, we are highlighting they exsist. Why? Because they are not Microsoft, GameStop, or AMC. Etruscus is a hard working company, small in stature, but grand in potential. What Makes GME / MSFT / AMC so powerful is this community, and the retail investors that fund their growth. These large companies more often than not, earn your investments through their hard work, but that hard work is only presented to you because of vast marketing budgets and constant exposure. You've never heard of Etruscus Resources, or their hard work. 

This is not a call to action, nor a indication of sentiment. This is simply an opportunity to review a possibility, weight your options, and follow along on a journey.

Etruscus' latest example of hard work, culminated in their DTC eligibility announced today. This announcement gives them a strong opportunity to present their case for funding, and move their projects along. From the investors in the OTC Markets perspective, this provides the opportunity to review a growing company and review investment opportunity on a freshly listed ticker. 

Check out an Exclusive PulseBrief interview with Etruscus Resources CEO Gordon Lam, in which he outlines this milestone in the companys strategy, and review the complete press release here:

636,Complete list of this week's trending tickers and top posts from Reddit,"**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

I know the basics. Basically stocks 101. But what I can invest, I'm buying little bits at a time (1 to 2 shares in expensive stock, 5 to 10 in less expensive), mostly at the end of the week if I see a dip and only in industries I understand and follow. I like tech, so I've bought a few shares in Intel, AMD, and Sony just to test the waters. After a few days I was up on all 3. Then I saw Vizio was having it's IPO, so I purchased some of that. I was up about 9% after about 4 days. For shits and giggles I bought some AMC and Dogecoin as well. I'm in it mostly for the long game. I just want to buy and sit on stock. Then I read everyone says Palantir is a great long term stock and I read up on them and thought they have a bright future, so I bought some of that. I'm down on them, but going to hold for a long time. My question is, is buying a little bit of stock here and there, mostly in just industries that interest me and in ""stable and reliable"" companies only in dips, and holding for a long time viable?

If I was to buy a cash secured put on AMC with the maximum time to expiration which is 622 days at a strike price of $12 which is $1.65 over the current stock price and collect a premium of about $720. Would the contract pretty much get assigned instantly? Yeah I would be paying a little more for the stock , $165 to be exact. So I would be paying a total of $1165 when the contract was exercised, but I would have $720 premium that would cover almost 2/3 of the contract. I get that the stock price could just continue to fall and I would be paying to much if that were the case, but if I was already committed to buying the stock at the current value I would have bought it anyway and spent more of my own money.

644,Trade Analysis," 

Hi everyone,

First time poster and just started trading options a couple weeks ago. Ive been stock trading for a while and figured it was time to give options a go as i could see the benefit of paying premiums as opposed to tying up my whole portfolio.

Last week i had purchased some options, these particular ones were:

NLS 5/21 puts with a strike of $15 @ 1.31

NLS 5/21 puts with a strike of 12.550 at 1.13

sA couple days after i bought them i was up about 40% on them and sold them a day or two later to lock in some profit. i was not ITM (i think it briefly dipped into the money) when i sold but saw some pretty steep profit with minimal price movement.

Fast forward to this week and i boughht some of the following:

AMC 4/16 puts with a strike of 10 @ 1.13.

AMC 4/16 puts with strike of 9.50 @ 1.10

Now these AMC puts went negative like 50% within a day or two. The first question is why would they swing so quickly into the negative with still so many days out. I would assume its because AMC went up a bit the days following but it wasnt very much , definitely less than $1 on the stock price.

Secondly, the offering gave a huge sell off that put me into the money on both of the puts but they are still showing negative. Now i know that i lose value on my options in time, but these were bought on 3/25, so about a week now with still another 2 weeks left. Why did they decay so fast? im looking at the volitility to explain the deep loss even now that im ITM and i would assume that i overpaid because of the IV?

if my NLS was quickly profitable with little movement, did i mess up by buying so close to expiry? was it simply overpaying on a premium ? when i started this i day traded some F option for 1 contract and i was up like 30% very quickly with minimal price movement. Im exploring and learning greeks to see if there is a component that made this trade such a bad one or rather, so hard to become profitiable while the others were profitable without even getting into the money so much.

Good luck to everyone!",2021-04-02 10:50:39

648,Buying more ASO Calls," 
&nbsp;

**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. 
 
&nbsp;
  
Ok, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. 
 
&nbsp;
 
**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**
 
&nbsp;
 
Hedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: 
 
1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. 
  
2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  
 
&nbsp;

 
Retailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. 
   
&nbsp;

Let's look at the short interest over time for ASO: 
 
&nbsp;

|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|
|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|
|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|
|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|
|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|

&nbsp;

We can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. 
 
&nbsp;

Most shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. 

&nbsp;

Some may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, 
&nbsp;


>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.
&nbsp;


So, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. 

&nbsp;
 
**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**

&nbsp;
 
[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  
 
&nbsp;

Did someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: 
 
&nbsp;

|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|
--:|:--|:--|
|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|
|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|
|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|
|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|
|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|

&nbsp;
 
Price at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. 
 
&nbsp;

Let's see that in a table: 

|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||
:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|
|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||
|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||
|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||
|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||
|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||
|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||

&nbsp;
 
Now, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. 

&nbsp;

 
|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|
--:|--:|--:|--:|
|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|
|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|
|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|
|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|
 
&nbsp;
 
I'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. 
  
&nbsp;

**Indicators** 
 
I don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) ""crossing over"" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. 

&nbsp;
 
**Conclusion** 
&nbsp;

For me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store.

649,DD on fundamentals and growth of Super League Gaming $SLGG,"From user u/whobangin

Welcome...  

Let me start off with the overall market and speculation regarding e Sports. 

https://preview.redd.it/41s9l13yngr61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842211b13348dc7e77610a6e39f33047c06b63e6

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.  


&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5c7pfn1qgr61.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e02a6df6d2de3a51a0842765b61cde1f361d748e

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?  


https://preview.redd.it/558olgjnqgr61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a79201ff31ef3d8ca3c42dc7091fb5b760125d

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding.",2021-04-06 08:15:03
650,Why CIDM is a steal at $1.40,"Cinedigm (CIDM) for 1.40 it’s a steal.

Here is my case for Cinedigm:

They have redesigned their corporate structure and put in new management to steer the company.

A flurry of great acquisitions including Fandor (the Netflix for indie films), The Film detective ( another streaming service), Screambox, etc.

Great streaming partnerships with global brands like Samsung, Roku, Vewd, Amazon, Vizio and now TCL to bolster their streaming services.

Reduced their debt aggressively over the past months.

AMC equipment Deal around $11 million.

And now they are just starting to get into NFTs which could be a game changer.

Plus analysts target price for this stock is $3.25, which is outdated, bcz since then the comapny have done all of the above. 


The future for this stock looks as bright as it can be so check it out for yourself, cz they have done alot more than just what  I have discussed here.

651,New Position: Atlas Air Worldwide,"My portfolio has a lot of technology and stocks that have performed well. As some of these stocks get near their all time highs again, I've been cutting down my exposure to some of them because some of them had grown to a large % of my portfolio (a good problem to have). As a result, I've built up some cash and have been looking for cheaper names of beaten down companies outside of technology. One name I came across was Atlas Air, ticker symbol: AAWW. 

\*Not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be an investment recommendation. Just my two cents about a company I found. Everyone should always do their own DD and reach their own conclusions. 

**Company Profile:**

The company operates aircrafts that it leases to a variety of customers. The business is divided up into two main categories: 

ACMI - the company leases out planes to customers either for chartering pasengers or shipping goods. The customer is responsible for expenses like fuel, landing, and other risks. AAWW is responsible for providing the plane, crew, maintenance, and insurance. 

Charter - this segment provides chartered planes to a variety of customers including sports teams, the US military, freight operators, etc. Here, the customer pays AAWW a fixed fee in order to charter passenger or cargo planes. 

**2020 Financial Highlights:**

\-Revenue grew 17% up to $3.2B  
\-Net Income grew to $360M  
\-2020 Gross Margin expanded to 34% from 30% in 2019  
\-Current Assets grew significantly to $1.2B, $845.6M of it in cash  
\-Net Debt decreased from $2.9B in 4Q 2019 to $2.02B in 4Q 2020, leverage ratio dropped from 4.4 in 2019 to 2.1 in 2020.   
\-Over $1B in cash from operations in FY 2020

**Thesis**

The company did not provide guidance for FY 2021, something that doesnt bother me. The pandemic is still pressing and likely will be for most of 2021. I wouldnt put much stock into any 2021 guidance given anyway. 

I really like this name because of its insanely low valuation and due to the continued need for freight operators. Shipping has obviously been tough due to the pandemic and shipping via ocean is challenging due to the high cost and delayed timing. There is a massive shortage of shipping containers and many shippers are looking for alternative sources to get goods shipped. I think a company like Atlas Air could benefit from that in 2021. Even as the pandemic starts to dwindle down (hopefully), there will still be a huge need for shipping and logistics. sure, people will go out and travel, eat in person, etc... but they will still order online and goods will be in high demand. 

The valuation of the company is insanely low right now. But how can a stock go from $23 to $61 in a year and still be highly undervalued? Right now, the company is trading at a Price/Book of .78 and a price/cash flow of 1.83. Notmany high quality names are going to give you those valuations. 

One other thing I like about this name is their cash build up and deleveraging. This company only had about $100M cash on hand as of 12/31/2020 and like most companies, it cut expenses and capex when the pandemic struck due to the desire to keep cash. Well now they are in a great position to use that excess cash to create value for their shareholders. Management did not make any predications about large stock buybacks, dividends, or acquisitions. I think stock buybacks, something I usually oppose, is the right answer here. The stock is trading under book value and it would make sense to buyback stock here. I dont know the industry well enough to know what names could serve as a strategic acquisition for them. 

**Ownership**

One other interesting note is that Amazon is a shareholder, owning less than 5% of the company. Amazon has warrants that it has excercised in the past. Based on what I can see, Amazon could own more than 10% of the company and appoint a Board member, but it has kept its ownership stake under 5%. As of 12/31/2020, AAWW has 27 airplanes leased to Amazon. 

Of the top 5 institutional holdings, 4 have increased their stakes in AAWW (BlackRock, Vanguard, Greenlight Capital, and Donald Smith & Company.)

**Risks**

\-While I think the Amazon deal is a net positive, there is a risk that Amazon could terminate the agreement. Amazon has the right to terminate the agremeent with or without cause with a 180 day notice. Additionally, if Amazon continues to acquire shares through their warrants, it would dilute existing shareholders. 

\-Air Atlas also does a lot of business with the Department of Defense, Air Mobility Command (AMC). Revenue from AMC represented 24% of total revenue in 2019 and 16% in 2020. While the lowering reliance on them is good, 16% is still a large number. Air Atlas and AMC operate in 2 year contracts and requires strong operational performance from AAWW. Changes to their relationship with AMC could harm the company. 

\-Climate change - if steps are taken to curb carbon footprints through additional regulations or taxes, that would be a net negative for AAWW

\-Decrease in air freight. I noted this one earlier, but the risk that air transportation demand decreases is a realistic risk. I dont agree with that and think the problems with shipping via oceans could lead to more business for air freight companies. 

**Final Thoughts:**

This is my first DD post on this form, so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts (good and bad). 

I like this company and continue to read about it. It is cheap and there are certainly reasons for that, but I think the stock is still undervalued. The main premise of this position is: ""Do you trust management to allocate capital correctly here given their large cash balance."" For me, the answer is yes, but I am mindful of existing relationships that company has with the DoD and Amazon. I have seen plenty of smaller companies get crushed due to existing agreements with larger companies. 

Right now, I own a LEAP call option. The Jan 2022 call option with a strike price of 50. I will be holding for the months to come.",2021-04-07 23:20:05

**Background:**

·  Topps has been around for 80 years selling baseball and football cards. 

·  Topps has license agreements with MLB, Disney, Marvel, etc. and is currently expanding its digital content and NFT business (currently only 6% of revenue).

·  The owner of Topps and the Chairman of the Topps company will be Michael Eisner, former CEO of Disney. 

·  Baseball trading cards and NFTs are booming now (Google it, many articles). 

·  Topps also has a thriving candy business (Ring Pop, Bazooka gum) and immaterial e-gift card business. 

**The NFT angle (The most important thing here):** 

·  $MUDS is one of few public companies that is a legit play on NFTs.  (Think $PLBY, $HOFV, $DLPN) 

·  Jason Mudrick, who led the SPAC said “We really underwrote the investment just on the existing business, that's what's so attractive about the opportunity, that you really get the upside of the NFTs for free.” 

·  Jason Mudrick made a lot of money off of AMC and GME. That tells me he understands retail excitement and its impact on stock price. 

·  Mudrick Capital put 100M into the PIPE, which may be 3-5% of his firm’s assets under management (AUM). This is a great show of confidence. 

·  Already launched Godzilla and Garbage Pail Kid NFTs on Wax and said it has a pipeline of NFTs including MLBs to launch in spring of 2020 and 2021. (Expect upcoming PRs) 

**Low Risk and High Reward NFT Play:** 

·  The SPAC will merge Q3 of 2021. Lot of time but usually good SPACs rise in value before merger.  

·  The Net Asset Value (NAV) and the Private Investment in Public Entity (PIPE) is 10.15 and the current stock price is 10.87. Until merger in Q3, the stock price can go below 10.15 but will almost certainly stay near NAV since the redemption value of the stock is 10.15. Floor price is 10.15. 

·  Unfortunately, many SPACs sell off after the ticker change due to a variety of reasons. I hope to exit MUDS at 15-20 dollars before merger and let the stock settle before deciding whether to stay long.  

**Easy view on Valuation:** 

·  MUDDS’s valuation is reasonable. Perhaps due to the weakness in the SPAC market, companies are coming to market at better valuations for investors. \*I really like $FRX and $STIC 

·  There is no other public company in the collectibles trading card space. Companies I’ve chosen to compare are SPACs I’ve owned in my personal portfolio.

·  MUDDS’s valuation is reasonable. Perhaps due to the weakness in the SPAC market, companies are coming to market at better valuations for investors. \*I really like $FRX and $STIC 

·  There is no other public company in the collectibles trading card space. Companies I’ve chosen to compare are SPACs I’ve owned in my personal portfolio.

656,"Trying to move away from a ""swing for the fences""/day trading mentality","Hey so I recently got into investing because of the WSB uproar. Unfortunately, i got caught up in the swing for the fences and hail mary mentality from that sub. Lost a bunch of money, have some left and want to focus on building proper fundamentals. It got to the point where i would check stocks every monring and it would tank my mood because it's all red.

I've diversified a decent amount but wanted to see what people on this sub did to kinda ""kick the habit"" of treating investing like gambling.
  
Secondly, I have some cash left on hand (aside from emergency savings). Do i wait for another market pullback later this year, or do I try to get in now? (ironic question given that's probably feeding into a day trader mentality)",2021-04-13 18:50:54
657,"Morning Update for Thursday, 04/15/21","Good morning everyone, happy Thursday.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks. Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management.

**Main Watchlist**

* Gapping UP: COIN, DELL, AMD, AAPL, MARA, RIOT, PTON, TSLA, AMC, PPD, APXT, GSK
* Gapping DOWN: SPCE, CRF

**Momentum Watchlist**

1. TAOP (+20%): Up after announcing a purchase agreement for more Bitcoin mining machines. Seeing strong price action on decent volume, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues. 
2. KXIN (+13%): Up after announcing approval by Nasdaq of their recent acquisition. Showing some weakness at the moment, I'll want to see it turn around. Possible premarket support around the 2.70 area. 
3. INO (+17%): Up on a COVID-related catalyst. Seeing good price action and volume at the moment, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues. Premarket high of 9.80. 
4. LKNCY (+9%): Up after announcing an investment agreement. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, will be worth watching to see if the momentum continues after market open. 
5. OCGN (+1%): Couldn't find a relevant catalyst. Seeing decent volume and price action in premarket. The daily chart intrigues me so I'll be keeping an eye on this one. 

**Market Outlook**

After a mixed day yesterday, stocks look to open a bit higher this morning. The Commerce Department should be reporting the March retail sales report, and we could see the market react to this. SPY is trading just under 414, and is still hovering around ATH levels. Tech stocks are showing strength in premarket trading and are worth watching through the rest of the week. Bitcoin is currently trading around 62,700, and could see some more choppiness after pushing to a new ATH earlier yesterday. Bitcoin-related stocks are up a bit in premarket trading. EV stocks are also showing strength in premarket trading. Gold and silver are trading in the green, while crude oil is slightly in the red. AMC was picking up some momentum in premarket trading, it could be worth keeping an eye on the memes to end the week. The market is showing strength this morning, with lots of stocks gapping up. I'll be cautious in my trading, and make sure to not chase profit. There will always be more trading opportunities. Nothing wrong with sitting on your hands and running your screener again a few times after the market opens. 

Remember to use proper risk management, make sure you size appropriately for your account, and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",2021-04-15 08:45:54

> Gensler, chosen for the role by President Joe Biden, will now play a key part in enforcing and drafting the rules that govern Wall Street, investors and a wide range of other financial entities.
> 
> Now, with the SEC commissioners possessing a 3-2 Democratic majority, Gensler will likely have a long to-do list after he settles in to his new job.

> Progressives expect the 63-year-old to follow through on his promises to look into a range of topics, including digital currencies, the Game Stop trading mania and how corporate America prioritizes environmental, social and governance issues.
> 
> Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive, is perhaps best known in Washington for his unyielding work at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where he devised the regulatory framework for the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market.
> 
> Democrats and Republicans alike asked Gensler in March whether he would scrutinize payment for order flow and game-like tactics used by brokerages to entice customers to their platforms. Both subjects received attention on Capitol Hill this year after January’s wild trading in Game Stop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks.
> 
> Gensler also noted potential problems with the current structure of payment for order flow, a common practice on Wall Street whereby trading firms, such as Citadel Securities, pay companies to send them their customers’ orders for execution.
> 
> Questioned in March how the SEC should regulate bitcoin and other digital assets, Gensler replied that the responsibility could fall across the government depending on how assets such as bitcoin are classified.

659,"The market is perfectly healthy, and not about to drop, or have a large correction like everyone suspects (Hear me out)","I continue to see people being cautious of the markets, and though the vast majority of you will likely disagree with me, and most likely downvote this, just please read through it before hand.

&#x200B;

The market if looked at from a simple graph looks absurd in comparison to previous years, 20% growth even after a crash! however, if compared to previous years this is not 'super uncommon' and still possible like 2013 for example. From this point on when I say the markets I am really just referring to the SPY, since its a simple and accurate portrayal of the overall market imo.

sure, there are some stocks that obviously may crash, and are most certainly going to be argued about if they will crash or not, for example AMC, GME, etc. however, the overall market could not be healthier at the moment, we are currently coming out of a pandemic, and the largest companies are gaining more and more business as the smaller mom-and-pop shops are being forced to close due to a lack of business, while companies like AMZN and WMT have become evermore profitable in 2020 (while this may not be good overall, looking at it from a strictly stock market performance stance, its great news) due to this separation, and allowing big companies to do better, it makes sense the market is growing at such a rate (though maybe the 7-8% in march/April may call for a slight correction). 

companies like CCL, DAL, AAL, and other covid recovery stocks are also improving as their prospects look better going forward, and consumer spending is going to increase as we leave this pandemic behind us. interest rates are extremely low, allowing companies to further increase their profits, and grow as companies, in not creating crazy overvalued companies (there are obvious exceptions)

I see many people worried about inflation, and showing various graphs that have flaws, such as the M1 graph I believe I saw on the home page here, or maybe on a similar subreddit, hinting that there is far too much money in circulation right now, but that graph has only gone up so much because of the shift from M1 not including savings accounts to now including them.

Furthermore, comparing it to the 2000 bubble is not even fair, the 2000 bubble had seen at least 230% growth in the 5 years leading up, we have only seen around 100%. during the 2000 bubble, nobody thought the market would crash, and continue the increase, during this current market however, things couldn't be more different, everyone is trying to guess what will cause the market crash, you see it all over the news, on CNBC, barrons, and then in all the investing subreddits, trying to predict the next market crash. there are no crappy loans like in 2008, and again, like in 2008 nobody really assumed a crash, and everyone assumed house prices would just increase, however that couldn't be more different today, (with the stock market I mean). 

I believe this has just been an exceptionally good year, and may continue until 2022 or 2023 even, or may slow down soon, and just consolidate, but personally, I don't see a large drop like everyone is suggesting. If you disagree, that's up to you, but for the love of god, please stop putting graphs that don't prove anything about a crash coming, I've seen 3 different graphs posted make trending, trying to indicate a crash is coming, which I believe are unrelated, or are exaggerated.",2021-04-16 13:11:06
660,Being Defensive in the Mining Space,"My gut is saying at the moment that the market is going to send a hard lesson this summer to the speculators. The hedge funds have taken some big losses from the ""unwashed masses"" and the overall system has been threatened. There will be retaliation. Retail investors in the ""bubble stocks"" are concentrated enough that you can blow a lot of them out of the water by attacking only a handful of assets. If you do, margin calls will take out the rest.  If I was one of the evil money men then I would be looking to use this summer (and the relatively thin trading that goes along with it) to weaken the entire populist movement.

In our mining sector, such a move would affect mostly the ""story"" stocks - energy and high tech metals associated with companies that are not current producers. I am looking at these as potential risks in the short to medium term future since they will be the biggest casualties of a bubble burst - not that any large trading house would go after any junior mining stocks directly, but they could very well become collateral damage since the same people holding Gamestop and AMC are probably the same people holding the most speculative mining stocks in the junior space.

Then again, maybe I am just a paranoid old man longing for the long-lost ""blue chip"" days. It happens.",2021-04-18 11:58:50

664,Any Next Steps???,"What are some possible next steps?

I own 100 shares of BAH and ONE ☝️ Contract for $70 Deep ITM Calls set to expire 9/17/21.

I am very green to options. This is my second ever options contract that I have bought. The first one was for BAH as well that I bought and made some money on, nothing to brag about, which just recently expired last week. That first contract I had was a for a shorter term and only ITM at $80, which I picked up when the stock price was at $78. It had recently dropped because they missed earnings due to Covid.

I am very bullish on the stock and I feel that my first contract I bought I probably missed on the expire date. I probably should have bought one month later, next month, because earnings will be next month.

Well I wanted to simply sell my $80 calls and buy the same $80 calls at a letter expire, but being that the stock price was at $84-$85 the calls carried a high premium over what the stock was trading at. So I went with the deeper in the money calls at $70 at an even later date so I didn’t pay as much of a premium. If I would have waited ten minutes the other day I could have paid $1 less $14.10 instead of $15.30, but oh well, I live and learn. Don’t buy options in the first hour of the market is what I found out, or at least until the new prices are reflected. I sold-off my original $80 contract to someone else and made about $100-$120. So I consider myself even.

Okay, so back to next steps. I want to make more money with BAH, but all my other money is tied up in GME, AMC, UWMC and VWAGY, except for I have about $1700 cash still left.

Is there anything I can do with my $1700 cash to perhaps make some more money on BAH? Keep in mind I also have those 100 shares I own.

I was reading something about selling short-term ITM Calls to make more $ during the period that I own the longer DITM Calls. 

Thoughts on that strategy given my current position, and is there anything else I can do? Also, did I do the right thing about going deeper ITM?",2021-04-23 13:05:39

666,How meme stocks like Gamestop and AMC changed Wall Street,,2021-04-25 19:41:26
667,"Morning Update for Monday, 04/26/21","Good morning everyone! 

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a few minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

* Gapping UP: MARA, RIOT, MVIS, MSTR, TSLA, NIO, IMNM, SPCE, AMC
* Gapping DOWN: TKAT, BEKE, GSX, CLAR

**Momentum Watchlist:**

1. SJ (+35%): Up after becoming the first live streaming platform in mainland China to offer NFT’s. Seeing good volume and price action in premarket, I’ll be watching to see if the momentum continues. Premarket high of 13.78.
2. OCGN (+16%): Up on news of the direct offering, after the stock was hit on Friday after the news broke. Has momentum from the past couple days of trading. Just be cautious, as this could get over-extended.
3. BWAY (+14%): Up after receiving FDA 501(k) clearance for its treatment of major depressive disorder. Seeing good price action on decent volume at the moment, I’ll be watching to see if the momentum continues. Premarket high of 9.81.
4. SOS (+3%): Up on Bitcoin momentum. Seeing okay volume in premarket, but I’ll want to see it pick up a bit more.
5. MICT (+15%): Couldn’t find a relevant catalyst. I usually don’t trade stocks this cheap, but I’ll be keeping an eye on it.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open this morning, perhaps a bit lower than we closed on Friday. A lot of big names reporting earnings this week, and it will be interesting to see how the market reacts. After hitting a new intraday ATH on Friday, SPY is now trading a bit under 417. Bitcoin is recovering a bit from this weekend, currently trading around 53,700. Bitcoin-related stocks are up in premarket, and they’ll be worth watching throughout the week (especially if Bitcoin shows strength). Tech stocks are showing some weakness in premarket, but they’ll be worth following this week. Marijuana stocks are up a bit in premarket, but nothing special. I’ll be keeping an eye on these stocks closely, particularly any potential catalysts. Gold is trading slightly in the red, silver is up, and crude oil is down. We could see some choppiness and indecision in the market, with so many big names reporting earnings this week. Stay patient and disciplined, as there will always be other trading opportunities in the market.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)

I know other brokerages restricted GME/AMC. But Robinhood's restricted list was way bigger and included stocks such as AMD, AAL, BYND, GM, IPOE, MRNA, and SBUX. I had got into stocks in January 2021 as a new years resolution. Which was a couple weeks before the GME stuff and reddit trading was even all over the news. At the time I honestly thought the buying restriction was something a part of the stock market. As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. 

Now that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that. They limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside. I really hope that doesn't happen again.",2021-05-01 09:36:51

AMC has been laying low ever since the WSB pump & has been consolidating between 6.00 - 20.00 for three months. 

&#x200B;

Relative Volume on this ticker is showing amount of shares being traded compared to previous volume is very low. In fact, only 24% of volume was traded compared to its average this past week. 

&#x200B;

We are sitting on support preparing to reverse around the 9.90 level. Entry will be made once reversal is confirmed with increasing volume.

Here are the levels we are looking at for May:

&#x200B;

\*\*First Target: \*\*12.50

\*\*Second Target:\*\* 17.00

\*\*Stop Loss:\*\* 8.75

Shares will suffice for this play, but options will maximize profit. Recommended 1-2 months out expiration date with a 12.00 - 15.00 strike price.

673,"Expected moves this week. Roku, DraftKings, Uber, Cronos Peloton and more","## The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** closed slightly higher on the week but below its intra-week highs. The VIX closed higher on the week, up to 18.60 from 17.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a **1.2%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$412** as a *bearish consensus* and **$422** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Expected Moves for This Week** via [**Options AI**](https://www.optionsai.com/):

* SPY 1.1%
* QQQ 1.6%
* IWM 2.2%

QQQ vol (and expected move) is slightly less than last week with the earnings reports from Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet now out of the way.

Say your 18/19 with a part time job (assuming your in school) GROW YOUR MONEY. I am 100% not saying gamble in stocks like GME, AMC, etc. but really invest your money in strong fundamentally stable stocks, or ETF’s if you want to play it more safe, because in the next 3, 4, 5 years of your life your not going to have that money to play with. Bills will eventually start to pile up so get started sooner then later! If you are this audience you really have an amazing opportunity that most people don’t have, you have the ability to a leg up over the next person in regards to your finances, and to jump start the growth of your money substantially.",2021-05-05 09:57:40
676,Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DD,"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock.  But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones.  The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business).  This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government.  Those people all buy ammo.  Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap.  The national ammo shortage still persists to this day.  Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online.  It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend.  They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings?  Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades.  They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day.  Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter.  Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6.  Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping.  But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog.  Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high.  Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b.  About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK.  Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends.  I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33.  Long-term bullish.  I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!).  So I'm posting it now.  Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock.",2021-05-05 21:31:43

678,"According to Morningstar, only 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished positive in the previous decade (plus what I've learned over my 12+ years investing)","Source:  [How Many Stocks Beat the Indexes?](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1035348/how-many-stocks-beat-the-indexes)

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY & QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY & QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

I didn't mean for this post to turn into a soapbox speech but if it came off that way, my apologies. Just trying to convey some interesting research I heard/read with some lessons I have learned.

Happy investing!",2021-05-06 19:17:44

It's good if this is for entertainment value, but don't use them as a real method of buying stock, even though they say ""take it with a grain of salt"" you shouldn't even take it with that.

684,"How to make ""free"" money by lending out your AMC shares","Right now, short sellers are willing to pay very high interest to short AMC stock.  You can track borrow costs at [iBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc).  If you lend your shares out to short sellers, you can get paid for holding AMC.  You can get paid like 10% annualized or more.

**Method A**:  If you use Interactive brokers, sign up for their ""yield enhancement program"".

**Method B**:  Lend your shares out through the options market.

Here's how you do method B.  Buy a call option and sell a put option at the same strike price.

For example, you can buy a June 16 $11 call for $1.70 and sell the $11 put for $2.38.  If AMC goes sideways (its current price is $10.41), you will lose $0.59 on the put option.  So, you are getting paid **$0.09** for holding AMC until June 16 (37 days).  No matter what the stock price does, you will be 9 cents ahead of just owning the stock directly.

If you don't hit the bid/ask spread and use limit orders to get your position, you can probably buy the call for slightly cheaper and sell the put for slightly cheaper.  So, that would let you make more than 9 cents per 100 shares... it's somewhere less than 18.5 cents.

The bid/ask for AMC and the options are:

AMC  $10.43 / $10.44  
$11 call  $1.67 / $1.70  
$11 put  $2.37 / $2.50

If you paid the midpoint price for everything, you'd make 18.5 cents.  Usually the market makers will cheat you so you lose money to transaction costs.

**Method C**:  Don't lend your shares out.  Just buy a deep in-the-money call option on AMC.  Deep in-the-money refers to strike prices lower than the current trading price.  If the strike price is really low, then the call option will be extremely similar to owning the stock.  For example, a $0 strike price would almost be the same as owning the stock (except for the borrowing costs reflected in the price of the options).  The problem with buying a really low strike price is that the spreads are wider --> your transaction costs are higher.

The $9 call has fairly low spreads because options under $3 get price in penny increments.

So let's say AMC is trading at 10.46/10.47 and the $9 call is trading at $2.46/$2.51.  If you buy the call and AMC goes sideways, then you lose $1.035 per 100 shares because the options premium on AMC is very expensive.  But if the stock goes to 0, then the options premium would be worth it because you lose $2.50 instead of $10.465.

# Why some dirtbag investment professionals don't lend their shares out

Suppose that a lot of AMC shareholders moved all of their shares out of their margin account and into a cash account.  This would lower the supply of shares that can be lent out, potentially driving the borrowing costs to something ridiculous.  If the borrow costs are too high, short sellers will start covering their positions (e.g. buying the stock) because they don't want to lose money on their trade.  Sometimes they have no choice- if the broker cannot locate shares to borrow, the broker will force the client's account into covering the short position.  (The broker is legally obligated to do this because naked short selling is supposed to be illegal.)

What they try to do is market manipulation.  They buy lots of shares and put all of them into a cash account.  The rising stock price creates a short squeeze along with some potential forced covering from short sellers who cannot locate shares to borrow.  Market manipulation is illegal by the way.

But anyways, that's the only argument against lending out your shares.  So, you should probably take advantage of the free money.",2021-05-12 14:14:32
685,"I am Officially going defensive tomorrow! I was preparing for this for several weeks, but I too was buying the dip! Bad strategy as you see the Red deepens!","Unfortunately, the waters are not safe! There seems to be blood everywhere and I do not think it is over just yet. In my opinion we may see another 10% drop at worst. Retail is very big in this market, money is flowing so it can just as fast bounce back! However, I do not see 20% on the Nasdaq as impossible. I wouldn’t say likely, because we have had amazing earnings, but possible. There are many stocks even if they dropped another 50% I am not sure if I would be interested. I can name a ton! An absolute ton, but I do not want enemies. So as I mentioned before I will say LMND, SNOW and “Mighty TSLA”. Why do I say this? These companies make no cash, they have no cash, they have massive debt. They have no means of getting cash but to sell new shares to retail…. Do they really want to do that in this market? As they drop the only way to stop it is someone coming in to bid, or a bigger buyer. In terms of TSLA who is bigger? No one? Check their financials 17 billion cash and 14 billion debt! Also, that cash was raised in 2020 via bonds and new shares to the tune of near 20 billion! They actually had negative cash flow! Could this offset in the long term, yes! But not right now so that’s about buying on the dip and why your stock can go down a lot more than 20%.

I have about 80 tickers on my “Plays” list. I have actually told the Elite Group this weekend I will tell them every ticker and from which watch list it comes from. Of these 80 or so plays I would say about 40 of them are defensive or super defensive (dividend stocks). Some of these there were mentioned in the past include. 

GO (Especially after a huge drop on so so earnings)

Lake (They make hazmat suits and make cash!)

LL (They make wood and got chopped after a big rally)

NLY (High paying dividend REIT)

PSEC (High paying dividend capital raising company thru loans/mortgages/investments etc)

There are many more but I haven’t mentioned them publicly. So this is just an idea of what defensive is. I don’t want people getting caught buying tech/growth and the blood shed doesn’t end. Yes, you may time the dip perfectly…. But I bet yesterday after we bounced off the lows, you thought that was the end….. then this morning with the CPI….showing inflation….. I mean come on, we all know inflation is here…. And yes unfortunately, rates will rise, but I think that can could get kicked down a few months or quarters longer….. Will your tech company with 5-10% coupon bond survive rate hikes? You should know the defensive stocks make cash! They just don’t grow, and have very low rates or some don’t even have bonds! They have a simple revolving credit facility at a low rate. (NLS has lower than 4% and now has 13 million on their line….. last quarter it was over 30!) Just giving you an example.

Where do I get these details? Unfortunately, yes you should be checking at least 10Q. I didn’t say you must read 100-500 page 10K…. At worst at least read an 8K sometimes they are 5-7 pages…however you should know an 8K is like a brief prepared for retail (dummy) summary. The 10Q is official. But at least read an 8K…..

Well Ultimate/Nathan, I don’t want to read an 8K…… I say so you did your homework at 1 point or another? Were you getting paid/or invested money? You did chores growing up…. Same thing….. Now you are willing to pay 100, 1,000, 5,000 even 10,000 into a company and not knowing if your company is junk???? Listen, I did not label your company junk…. The broad market says that if your company pays 10% coupon it is junk…….GME…..18% AMC…..once again I did not label your company I am telling you the facts….

Good luck everyone. I am going defensive, hopefully you guys at least do some due diligence.",2021-05-12 22:56:17
686,"If price rises exponentially, are there still buyers interested in purchasing deeply ITM contracts (selling to close without exercising)?","Hello friends,

I’m still fairly new to options but I have a quick question. So personally I cannot stand meme stocks, but after looking at my analysis I actually agree with AMC rising to some extent - whatever that may be - at some time in the future. Due to this, I decided to buy some calls (5 to be exact at a $10 strike expiring next month). Let’s say something CRAZY happens and it actually does go to a nice round $100 a share. If I was to just sell to close the contracts, would there still be buyers interested in purchasing such a deeply ITM option or would demand drop and only be for the stocks closer to ATM because of costs? I do not have enough free cash in my account right now to exercise in the case of no buyers, so I’m trying to plan an exit route in case something does go wild. It just seems like if the stock is trading high, such as $100, no one would be looking at $10 calls. Thank you.",2021-05-13 01:06:21

**Outlook/Game Plan:** I mentioned yesterday that the next support on SPY was at the 50 day moving average and thats exactly where price stopped selling off, right at 404 on the penny. Now pre market the SPY is trying to hold the 50 day moving average. I'm honestly not sure if the 50 will hold or not as there is still plenty of room to pull back (the 200 dma is at 369) It feels like the market has been selling off for months not. Not the indices but individual stocks, It's almost the opposite of last year but what goes up must come down. Many stocks are approaching very low areas, are getting oversold so hopefully in the next few weeks here we can get some nice moves back higher. If you were trading oil stocks yesterday or penny stocks you probably did ok because Energy led the market. Plan today is to stay focused, and trade solid patterns, concentrating on minimizing risk and trading stocks with good catalyst. I'll most likely run a scan at the open to make sure I'm in the right place. Good luck out there!

689,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 13, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 13, 2021**

The wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterday’s selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed’s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.

The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. 

Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Today, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term. Just my two cents.

690,31 year old investor advice,"Hello all,

Just learned about this sub and have been doing quite a bit of reading...I wanted to get some advice and critique on my portfolio currently and see what others may recommend I look to do..I am looking to expand my dividends portion of my investment options.. Main goal is to expand dividends into my future and eventually ""live off"" them.

NIO	500 shares

NVDA	10 shares
	
SCHD	27 shares
	


As you can see..alot of my portfolio does consist of TECH stocks however not much dividend related stocks that pay out aside from T and SCHD which are newer stocks that Ive recently added this month..majority of my other stocks and shares Ive bought insanely low and really made some nice bucks out of them like NIO, AMD, and NVDA..I'm looking to keep those for the foreseeable future as I really like what they do and where they can go in the future..

I definitely feel like my setup has plenty of tech and could use some more diversity..Opinions and advice on where I should take the next step?",2021-05-13 17:46:44
691,CCL / Carnival Cruise Line,"I've made a bit since last year playing the ups and downs on CCL stock, put in about 1k when it crashed down to 8$ at the start of the covid nonsense, and kept feeding it every time it dipped. with a good half dozen complete sell offs when it peaked only to buy back in within 1-2 weeks when it dipped again.  
As it stands, I think the cruise industry got hit the worst by covid, but I think its popular enough that it will be around long after the plague ends.  This stock was in the high 60$s in 2018, and down from some mishaps to the 50$s and high 40$s in 2019.   Its got good potential in a long run of doubling any investment, but that could be 3 to 5 years at the earliest.  For the short haul though, it has dipped back down to 25$\~ and could easily rebound as it has the past 3 months bouncing between 25$ and 30$  
Other than like 10 AMC stock and a clutch few GME, I think this is my cash cow, and uhh, I like you apes, so look into it and decide if its right for you, cheers.

The stock price of Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR) increased by  over 10% during intraday trading. There was no direct news from the  company today so it appears that there are external factors in play.

 It appears [that the increase of AMC today](https://pulse2.com/amc-entertainment-nyse-amc-stock-over-25-increase-explanation/)  triggered a “meme” stock frenzy today by retail investors. Express is  part of a group of stocks that were short-squeezed in late January by  the r/WallStreetBets community on Reddit. So when the stock price of a  company in that group increases, the others also tend to increase as  well.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY Gapping up pre market after showing support at the 50 Day Moving average but gapping into the 9 ema which may act as resistance. QQQ gapping up into the 100 day moving average which could also act as resistance. QQQ will still have to break back above the 50 day moving average. We may need to base out a bit and build up some strength before moving higher, this would help stocks break back over and remount short term averages before a move higher, but that's if we move higher, still plenty of room for SPY to sell off. Many gaps today are gapping inside of yesterdays range. I myself do not particularly like trading inside days as I feel they are less predictable, and often result in small range bound trading. There were a few decent earnings released that had reactions and my focus will remain on those and 2nd day plays. If nothing else pops up in the pre market then I will run a scan after the open in order to find stocks moving with volume and if things are looking alright then I will make some trades. If I feel like this is just going to be a range bound day, I may just chill out until Monday and save my money for better days. If I feel like I have to be a degenerate, then I'll trade with smaller size because I don't like losing on Friday's. Good luck out there. have a great weekend! See you all Monday.

697,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**

Stocks continued yesterday’s momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%.

698,Why I Think AMC Will Result In Bagholders,"Alright, this will be quite unpopular, but I don't buy this AMC will squeeze to the moon thesis for a few reasons.

Let’s look at liquidity:

AMC had $813m in cash as of 3/31/21. Since then they’ve raised $428m in fresh capital through share issuance, bringing up their total to $1.241b. This is good except their current cash burn is \~$300m/qtr which gives them 4 quarters of runway. I do think that as covid goes away completely (possibly by fall) that there’s a chance for this to stabilize. But there are a lot of variables to this such as timeline of opening and attendance rate once we are fully open.

Next there's the valuation:

Forget covid and let’s value them assuming everything returns to normal. Average adj. EBITDA between 2018-2019 was $850.3m. EV today using today’s stock price and 3/31/21 debt numbers is $16.1b, which gives us 18.9x EV/adj. EBITDA multiple. For comparison, the same multiple was 6.9x in 2018. So assuming things return perfectly to normal, AMC is still valued 2.7x what it was in 2018. The highest market cap that AMC had previous to this year was in 2017 when its market cap was $4.0b vs. $5.8b today.

Conclusion:

AMC is massively overvalued (who knew). Of course, everyone will point out this is a short squeeze opportunity like GME. However, there will probably never be another GME which once had 141% short interest at its peak vs. \~20% for AMC now. What that means is GME had a legitimate reason for its stock price to completely decouple from its fundamentals, AMC doesn’t, not to quite the extent of GME. There may be some squeezes here and there, but more players will join the short when they see how overvalued AMC is.

The current buying is predominantly from retail, and the CEO even boasted as much saying retail investors comprise of 80% of the share base. While people think this is a positive, I disagree. There is a reason institutional ownership is low and it means that while the stock price can certainly continue to go up, it will also shoot down just as fast, once everyone begins to exit. With a short interest of 20%, how are 80% of the people going to get out? Who are they going to sell to? In the end, it will just be a shifting of bags amongst the retail.

If I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute the share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don’t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It’s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.

A lot of people are propping this up as something of a fight for the common people against the hedgies, who have done all the wrong. I actually think this can be quite irresponsible it’s driving people to pour into AMC, basically like a Ponzi scheme. Invest safely!",2021-05-14 18:50:15
699,Can we please talk about YOLO BSC Token?,"Greetings to whom this may concern. I hope this message finds you well.


It has come to my attention that one of the most critical Crypto
projects is being overlooked by many. This important project is still
in its early stages of development, but it comes from a community that
has already provided auditing services to
anyone in the Crypto realm. Their auditing service aims to verify that
any and all the Crypto tokens and projects are in fact legitimate and
won't result in a rug-pull. This can help everyone to invest in other
Crypto projects with confidence without the fear of a sudden rug.

Too many people have been rug pulled from underneath their feet,
including myself, for the sake of another’s greed. This project has
the potential to change the norms of many altcoins and meme coins for
better. I am talking about the $YOLO BSC Token.

What makes $YOLO different from every single other altcoin? I believe
it is its organic gains through taxation. With each, and every transaction
that goes through, a 10% tax is applied. 6% is redistributed to all
the token holders and 4% goes locked into liquidity. It discourages
the old-fashioned Pump and Dump activity you see on many coins. You
can try to pump and dump $YOLO, but please let the community know how
your results are. $YOLO is meant to be held on to for a long period of
time.

Moreover $ YOLO will be the advertising services trading currency for
other crypto
tokens, in conjunction with the aforementioned auditing services.
The more people will use $YOLO's services the greater the extent of a
healthy, verified ecosystem of crypto tokens will be.


The first most important time to invest is now. Which is the second?
In my opinion, it is after the AMC short
squeeze. For those unaware, AMC stock has been manipulated since
January of this year and will soon squeeze. If you don’t know what a
short squeeze is, please refer to the 2008 Volkswagen short squeeze.
Those who have shares in the stock will likely invest in different
Cryptocurrencies with their gains. You only live once to invest in
yourself, so why not invest in something that truly matters? I’m not
encouraging whale activity, but just something that will help this
project come to fruition.

Do your own research, and spread the word about $YOLO. Thank you for
taking the time to read this.

Kindest Regards,
Someone on the internet who wants to help make a difference.

701,Are strangles a good way to play AMC?,"I'm currently selling CC's on AMC just to generate some income and potentially lock in decent profits if it does go up. However, there is a decent chance AMC either rockets or drops like a rock to it's normal valuation.

If AMC does rocket, it would go up very significantly, so I could by a very OTM call and buy a ATM put because if it does drop, it may not drop significantly at first.",2021-05-16 03:02:28
702,I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6zj08b31uhz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0ac91fa9474cefc1d9647d6ee32a4a1da8f785d9)

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uup5fji2uhz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cfc237047022022a072eed651d1993b41ec9c324)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company’s latest earnings report. Even though the company’s revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to “Cookie Crisis” - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data – through third-party “cookies” – is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk’s business model.  

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%. 

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company’s earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it’s not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.  

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO’s announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company’s share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst. 

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Well Friday ended up being a very bullish day to trade with many opportunities. Now here on Monday SPY is getting rejected pre market by the 20 Day Moving Average and QQQ is getting rejected by the 50 Day Moving Average. Not many great gappers pre market at the time of writing this..  We could have an inside day and not many earnings plays being released today. Many stocks on the gap list are gapping into short term moving averages which could act as resistance. I will be focused on great charts with volume and if I don't get any then I won't trade. Sometimes you just have to be stubborn and when trading stocks, patience will usually pay off. You may have to miss some moves in the process of being patient but at least you won't get chopped up and diced into pieces. I'll run a scan after the open to find new movers if necessary. Risk management is king over everything. Knowing how to lose is just as important as knowing how to win. Good luck trading.

710,READ READ READ,"A Theory of Everything AMC: Wanda, AMC, the SEC, and Lawsuits

Disclaimer: Everything that is about to follow is speculation. It is purely a theory of mine based on known facts and common sense. Any dates included are to provide context. They do not indicate the beginning, middle, or end of the impending squeeze.

Disclaimer #2: I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, I just really like this stock.

TL;DR- Wanda, AMC, and the SEC are working together to build a case against the major short sellers committing blatant fraud daily that is suppressing the price of AMC stock. Wanda and AMC will stand to make a lot of money in lawsuits for capital losses. Meanwhile, the SEC will be able to prosecute fraudulent entities using information shared by AMC.

The Players:

Wanda America Entertainment- Before February of 2021, Wanda had voting stake in AMC and was the single largest institutional shareholder of AMC. In early February 2021, Wanda converted class B common stock to class A common stock, which allowed them to sell shares on the open market. On March 19-20, 2021, Wanda sold 15.6 million shares of AMC stock, reducing their holdings from 8.8% of AMC common stock to 6.8% of AMC common stock. Pay attention to those dates

AMC Entertainment- Led by CEO Adam Aron, AMC has staved off bankruptcy during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have raised a total of 752 million dollars from direct offerings in 2021. That is in addition to the funds raised in december 2020. This influx of capital has put AMC into a position that they can maintain operation at current levels until the end of 2022, per their Q1 2021 earnings call. The first dilution of 2021 put an additional 63.3 million shares on the market. That was completed on January 27, 2021. The second dilution was the ATM offering program that completed the sale of 43 million shares from April 27 to May 12. Remember these dates too.

Securities and Exchange Commission- As the lead regulating agency for the stock market, the SEC is supposed to legislate, investigate, and prosecute any entity committing securities fraud. We vilify them, and rightfully so. They have taken a sideline seat and watched as we battled back from our own 1 yard line to be 1st and goal today. Their only interest in all of this is to mitigate the effect on our economy as a whole and to prosecute the offending parties. In order to do that they need evidence. Not just evidence of when and what (dates, naked shorting amount, illegal FTD resets, etc), but also the WHO. We all have our sights on Citadel, but they are not the only complicit player here. This is systemic and market-wide. AMC and GME are not the only securities affected by this, but that are the most public. They are also the ones that can provide information that the SEC desperately needs.

The Game:

Remember when I said to pay attention to the dates before? Well, lets dig into those.

January 27- This was D-day for the HFs. We had them cornered, a squeeze was imminent. Share price rocketed to over $20 a share, trading halts comprised most of the market hours, brokers weren't allowing people to buy, and Apes were throwing shit all over the walls with excitement. Marge was dialing. During all of this, at the peak of all peaks, with us getting ready to get out of the atmosphere, AMC announced the 63 million share dilution. The following day, AMC plummeted to the 10-14 range, and started its descent back down to $5 a share. Why would they do this now? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

March 18-20- On March 18th, AMC is on the rise. We are about to break a critical resistance level at $14.50. Intraday, we break that wall. We are all watching patiently to get our tendies out of the fryer. It feels like January 27th all over again. Then, March 19th comes and instead of going up, share price drops. Not as heavily as on the 27th, but it doesnt continue the upward trend. All of a sudden shares available to borrow goes from 0 to millions. Apes are confused. It doesn't make sense. We broke the wall. it's time to move. Maybe it's just the last breath of the HFs before they let it run and Marge calls. March 20th rolls around, and again, the share price drops. This time, we crash below the $12.50 support level. In the following days, we come back down to the 10-11 dollar range, where we sat until the end of April. We later found out through 13F filings that Wanda sold 15 million shares, stalling our ascent and bringing us back down to earth. Why would a company who stands to gain billions from a squeeze do this? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

End of April 2021- Once again, we are on the rise. Not quite to the $14.50 break point, but we are in a streak of green days, shares available to borrow are almost gone, and cost to borrow is skyrocketing when they are available. It feels like January and March again. We're getting ready to break 12.50 and gap up to the 14s again. Then, AMC announces its ATM offering program. Once again, from the 27th of april through the end of May, we drop back to the 10-11 dollar range. We found out at the Q1 earnings that during this period of descent, AMC had sold over 15 million shares onto the market, raising a significant amount of capital. Once again, we plummet back to earth. Why would a company sacrifice billions in profits off of the ATM offering to sell all of it's remaining sellable shares at 9.50-10.50 a share? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

Where are we at today- Once again, we are getting ready to break the resistance levels, and shares available to borrow are somehow appearing out of nowhere. Borrow rates have dropped 75 percent in a week, and every time we push that level of resistance, we get pulled back down. Does this sound familiar? I think Wanda is unloading another block of shares. This is horribly bad for us right? Can't be good? Wrong. This was always the plan, it was always the game. They're adding shorty rocket fuel. FOMO is kicking in. Retail is seeing a huge increase in liquidity as new buyers join in for liftoff. It is the perfect time to drop shares if you are intentionally delaying the squeeze. Those shares are gone almost immediately. Literally, if they sell at open, even the full 30 million would get eaten up in the first hour of trading. In order to figure out why they would delay the squeeze, we need to look at the playbook.

The Playbook:

AMC and Wanda's goal throughout these last 5 months has been to build a case for the mother of all legal claims against the entities short selling the stock with synthetic shares. Each time we reach a breaking point for the good, they are keeping the SP down as they gather the information they need to file a lawsuit. I graduated with a political science degree, with the aim of going to law school, so I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to legal proceedings. Having said that, this is what you need to prove damages in a civil lawsuit.

1.) Who- Who was the offending party that caused the damage?

2.) When- During what period or at what time did they cause you the damage?

3.) How- What did they do that caused you to incur damages?

4.) Damages incurred- You need to be able to define the amount of loss incurred due to the actions of the offending party. In this case, its a pecuniary damage (money lost).

The plays:

1.) Share count- In order to identify the who and the how, AMC needs to be able to prove which entities wronged them, and the amount of damage EACH of them caused. IE, how many shares did they short using malpractice? (naked shorting, FTD resets, etc) The share count does this for them. In order to disseminate voting materials, they need to know the information of who owns the shares of stock, how many they own, and have the contact information to send out voting materials. This gives them the who and the factor to multiply damages incurred per share against.

2.) Delay annual meeting- I firmly believe AMC delayed the meeting because of the sheer amount of shares they counted. The last thing a company wants to do is go into a critical vote with an inflated number of shares. In order to get anything on the ballot to pass, they need a majority of shareholders to approve. If the amount of shares and votes is inflated, they could potentially see all of their ballot items fail to pass.

3.) Involve the SEC- When they knew the who and amount of shares, I believe AMC got the SEC involved. They were able to provide concrete evidence to the SEC of the fraud that was ongoing since December. The SEC needed that information to file legal proceedings. Keep in mind, they need the same things AMC does, minus the damages incurred, to bring a case against the malpracticing firms. At this point, the SEC can actively watch the actions of the offending parties in real time. Building a case until the next share count. In addition, this gives AMC the ability to follow with a civil lawsuit using the SECs findings as the How of their claim. Here's the bonus, the SEC will be able to show AMC the how during the time of the 43 million dilution. These illegal activities were going on during a share dilution, directly affecting the share price AMC should have gotten for their shares sold.

4.) 2nd share recount- I think the SEC advised AMC to conduct another recount for a few reasons. 1.) the illegal activity ramped up from Janurary to April, and the actual share count would have undoubtedly increased in this period, and 2.) It allows the SEC to track another data point while getting ready for the market implosion this could cause. It also delays a notification to the public of just how broken the system is. Now, when AMC announces the share count, the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will pursue, naming the defendants.

5.) Timing of dilutions- If AMC diluted during or after the squeeze, they wouldn't be able to correctly identify damages incurred and when they occurred. By having Wanda and AMC dilute when share price was not inflated, it gives a concrete timeframe of when they were damaged, as well as a count of shares that form the basis of the damage claim (15 million for Wanda, and 103 million for AMC).

4th and Goal (how it ends):

On June 2nd, AMC has to finish their share count so they can disseminate materials. Adam Aron has already stated he will make the share count public. When he announces the total shares counted, it will clearly show the blatant manipulation and illegal activities. Retail will FOMO, institutions will FOMO, and large private investors will FOMO. If you want confirmation that this was the end play, look for an announcement of a share recall, a formal investigation, or both with the announcement.

When they recall the shares, the MMs will need to get real shares, and only real shares, back from the HF before the date specified. This will ignite the margin calls and form the catalyst from the squeeze. The squeeze will be squoze, in theory. (Again, no dates, shhhh)

When the squeeze is over, AMC can now identify just how much they were damaged. They now have the who and when (share recount), the how (SEC investigation), and the damages incurred (delta between share price at market offering and top of the squeeze). A civil lawsuit will follow.

At any point after June 2nd, the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will have and identify the offending parties. Here is the beauty, they can file for an immediate injunction to take control over the offending parties assets. In fact, this is common in legal proceedings involving malpractice. You have evidence the offending party is committing illegal acts, so you stop them from continuing them during legal proceedings.

Confirmation bias time: Why would Wanda and AMC sell shares pre-squeeze? Remember I said you would find out below? Well buckle up. Imagine the shares you have now, and knowing that you could get the maximum gains possible (the top of the top peak), for your shares. That is the position AMC and Wanda have put themselves into. it is honestly genius if you really think about it. They don't have to time the sales. Just watch it go, and when the dust settles, they can name their price from HISTORICAL FACT. I think we would all take this option. AMC and Wanda stand to make billions from this from the way they have played this game.

Thank you if you made it this far. This was a labor of love and took some time. If you disagree with the above, any of it, let me know. This is just a THEORY. It makes sense though, doesn't it?!",2021-05-20 12:19:52

712,First major experience in the stock market with AMC and meme stocks,"Bought AMC back in February when everything kicked off.

I've had a few small OTC stuff with $100 thrown here or there in my account, this was my first foray into the real stock market.

Sold AMC last week at a loss, thought better of it, then bought it back in the dip. Cost basis went up (wash sale), so set a sell limit today and exited AMC when it dropped this morning.

Basically AMC at this point is pump and dump trading by WSB subreddit.

Sold for a loss today because it was tanking pretty hard in the am a few times. My cost basis was adjusted from the wash sale, so total loss playing around with AMC was like $30.  Now it's up to $15+ again this afternoon??? Can't deal lol

Is it often stocks jump by $2-3 in a day at 15% gain/loss when the stock price is in the teens? I think not, unless big news for investors, no major news really for AMC or AMCs business plans so that's why it's mostly pump and dump, or a small squeeze at this point, but short float was 20% as of April 30th with millions of shares sold and bought each day since with probably a constant adjustment of the shorting of the stock going on.

Using this as an overall experience to: 1. Not have paper hands and panic sell at a loss before midday, and most importantly, 2. Don't day trade meme stocks with high volatility of it's value over months.  Might be a squeeze today I think and I paperhanded it, but you know what, I don't care, it was annoying wondering if it's ever going up or tank to sub 10s for the foreseeable future.

I couldn't handle the volatility so exited and took that  money I had in my account and went into marijuana ETFs that I'll hold for the long haul...",2021-05-25 14:46:29
713,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 25, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 25, 2021**

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard & Poor’s said that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts’ expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation — rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago — the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

**Highlights**

* [U.S. new home sales pulled back less than expected in April over March,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-home-sales-fell-5-140851441.html) even as rising prices, tight inventory began to ripple through the housing market. New home sales fell by 5.9% in April over the previous month, giving back some of March's 7.4% gain, [the Commerce Department said Tuesday](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf). Consensus economists were looking for a drop of 7%
* The Washington DC’s Attorney General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday, alleging the company blocks sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices elsewhere to stymie competition
* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.

714,Trying to understand options,"Say I’m doing a call on AMC for $19 and the date is may 28th, that means that I want to buy this if I have a good feeling that it will hit $19 by may 28th, right?

The call also says it costs 74 cents. So I have to multiply that by 100, so it costs me $74 for the call. Is the $74 like the cost for the option? Meaning you don’t get that money back?

Also, if it does hit $19 and the price is currently $17.05, does that mean I get the 100 shares for $17.05 each?

I know these are basic questions but I have watched a few videos and did some reading and want to make sure I am understanding correctly.

716,What happens to the general stock market if the $GME and $AMC squeezes work?,"Based on my extremely limited understanding, these hedge funds need to keep adding additional shorts to cover their initial shorts, but this isn't something that can go on forever. At some point they get squeezed and get killed with losses. 

If that happens, won't some of these hedge funds go bankrupt and their stocks become available? Thus lowering the price of the stocks they have large investments in? Thinking similar to how Archegos went down and their stocks took massive hits. $VIAC went down about 50% if I recall correctly. 

Is the risk to this squeeze becoming a much larger Archegos situation across many more stocks and causing a major market crash a legitimate concern?",2021-05-26 16:06:57

""To start the day our EquityHub options model was telling us that nearly 30% of total AMC gamma expired tomorrow, 5/28.

719,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 27, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 27, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly as market participants looked toward the new weekly jobless report. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. 

This week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. 

Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, “Inflation has gone from being on no one’s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. There has been a tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.”

members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior
* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPW and IWM gapping up, pre market, QQQ slightly gapping/neutral. Very bullish action all week. Yesterday we saw some profit taking at the open in the majority of gappers and for the most part they sucked to trade. There were some great second day plays and trend plays, namely AMC which blasted (shout out to Manny for smashing that beast). Yesterday the Basic Materials sector lead the market with Industries like Coal, Aluminum, Copper etc bouncing after a nice pull back. We also saw continuation and more money flowing into Auto Manufacturers as well as weed stocks. Today there have been some earnings released but not many reactions, ULTA is gapping up so I can only imagine it's because since this Covid thing is beginning to wrap up they are expecting many more women and men to be out clubbing again and will need to start stocking up on their makeup supplies, yes I included men, this is 2021, get with the times. Other than that it's Friday, prepare for some profit taking after a strong week and I am also still expecting bullish behavior in many stocks. Managing risk is #1, good luck trading, have a good weekend, see you all Tuesday!

And remember when the mid caps and large caps fade usually the shit stocks (penny stocks) move.

731,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 28, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation, and a strong Weekly unemployment report. The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.

New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March's stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. 

In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed’s traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “An episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won’t affect Federal Reserve policy because they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves.” Moreover, he said “For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.” In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn’t expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.

In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021.

# **A big jobs report looms in the week ahead, as markets enter the often-weak month of June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/jobs-report-looms-in-the-week-ahead-as-markets-enter-the-often-weak-month-of-june.html)**
*****
> May’s employment report is the big event in the week ahead, as stocks enter the often weak month of June. Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance. Big cap indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow notched gains. The S&P rose a half percent, and the Dow rose 1.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat, up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.5%.
*****
> June is not historically a strong month for stocks. Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years, the Dow has gained just 0.12% in June and has been positive 52% of the time.
*****
> But over the past 20 years, June was far weaker, gaining only 40% of the time. June’s performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year, with an average Dow decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke.
*****
> The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity, but the most important measure will be Friday’s jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect Friday’s employment report to show the creation of about 674,000 jobs in May, after the disappointing 266,000 jobs added in April. That was about a quarter of what economists had expected.
*****
> “You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations, the market is going to get nervous,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “Hopefully, we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz, and we go into the Fed meeting and then we’re, ‘Hey, the economy is still on track.’”
*****
> # Big June event
> The Fed meets June 15-16, and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month. Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing. They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary, since the data is being compared with a weak period last year.
*****
> Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support. Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement, and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes, not expected until at least 2023.
*****
> If inflation runs too hot, the Fed’s main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates.
*****
> The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous, since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity. In theory, higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher-yielding bond investments over stocks.
*****
> The next big read for the economy is Friday’s jobs report, and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected. The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday. It showed core inflation running at 3.1% year over year, the strongest reading for that measure since 1992.
*****
> The Fed’s beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday. ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday, and ISM services is released Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday.
*****
> # Inflation flare-up
> The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2% target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level. Inflation has been running mostly below 2%, prior to the latest numbers.
*****
> “With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks, hotter than expected, the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG.
*****
> Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors. One of those stocks, AMC, closed off 1.5% on Friday after rallying 116% in the past week, giving it a 2021 gain of 1,200%.
*****
> “The net net on the index level is basically it’s a stock market that’s moving sideways,” Emanuel said. “Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term, the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run. When you look at it in the medium term, the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed’s paying insufficient attention to price stability.”
*****
> Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed’s 2% target. “The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2%, going back to 1989 is (a decline) of 1.6%, with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform,” he said.
*****
> Technology stocks, as measured by the S&P information technology sector, gained 1.6% in the past month, and are up 5.9% year to date. The sector is lagging the S&P 500′s 12% gain.
*****
> The top-performing sectors have been cyclical year to date, with energy up 36.2%, financials up 28.5%, materials up 20.1% and industrials up 18.3%. Communications services, which contains some internet growth names, gained 16% since the start of the year. Health care has been outperforming information technology, up 8.6% year to date.
*****
> In the past week, the S&P 500 gained 1.2% to 4,204 and is within 1% of its all-time high. The Dow rose 0.9% to 34,529, and the Nasdaq was up 2% at 13,748.
*****
> # Red flag?
On the edges of the financial markets, market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system. In the past week, institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed, nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday.
*****
> “There’s way too much liquidity in the system, and it’s happening as a result of the Fed’s ongoing QE, but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus,” said Goncalves.
*****
> He said the funds from trillions in stimulus, including to state and local governments, have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system. At the same time, institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds, now holding about $4.6 trillion.
*****
> Those funds also put pressure on the system, since they put funds in Treasury bills. Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse.
*****
> “There’s no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system,” he said.
*****
> “Institutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they don’t have enough bills or short-term commercial paper. There’s not enough fixed income assets to go around,” said Goncalves. He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio, and they would prefer to find other higher-yielding investments.
*****
> What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected, he said.

> # Days After Memorial Day Improving

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 31, 2021. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive.

> Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, but S&P 500 declined five straight days after 2015-2019. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%.

> # Checking the Gauges: Economic Surprise Indexes

> In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists’ forecasts, it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas. Driven by some improving COVID-19 trends, the economic backdrop has improved overseas, while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U.S. This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non-U.S. equity markets, and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non-U.S. stocks. We believe the improving COVID-19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread.

> For several years now, being underweight European equities, relative to the U.S., has been a winning trade. A sea-change in that thinking could be approaching as value-heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value, but a firm, constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off.

> The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, or CESI, tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations. The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, economically, global conditions remain rather strong, as evidenced by these indices, which remain above the zero line. This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions. The repair of global trade activity, as supply lines are reconnected, has been notably key in non-U.S. data outcomes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blog-chart-5.27.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking ahead, we expect now elevated economic expectations, particularly in the U.S., may prove a tougher target. As a result “economic surprises,” both in the U.S. and abroad, may fade as we move through the year. However, the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021. Global real GDP contracted 3.3% in 2020, and it is expected to rise to +6.0% in 2021, according to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, before ticking down to +3.4% in 2022.

> “Although high U.S. economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021, we still believe U.S. stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios. And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas, it is tough to overlook U.S. companies’ innovation and profitability advantages.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> # More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction

> The S&P 500 has been hovering around 0.5% below its record highs this week, but without a true test of those highs, sentiment has not moved very far. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37% last week down to 36.4%. While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size, the marginally lower reading does leave bullish sentiment at the lowest level since the end of October.

> Pivoting over to sentiment for equity newsletter writers measured in the Investors Intelligence survey, there were some more interesting moves. Bullish and bearish sentiments were not necessarily anything to gawk at similar to the AAII survey. Bullish sentiment has been on the decline with this week's survey showing a 3 percentage point drop to 51.5%, the lowest level since March 10th. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment moderated from 17.2 to 16.8%. That was the same level as the start of the month.

> The percentage of respondents ""looking for a correction"" was more notable. Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon (a 10% decline from a high), Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as ""looking for a correction"" when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point. Coming in at 31.7%, the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27.6% and is in the top quartile of the historical range. In other words, it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence. What is more significant is that it has been over a year since this part of the survey has seen these levels.

> In the history of the survey dating back to 1963, there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30% for the first time in at least a year. The most recent of these was in April 2009. In the table below we show the S&P 500's performance in the year following those occurrences. As shown, performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75% of the time one month, three months, and one year out. Additionally, while there were two times, 1982 and 2009, in which the S&P 500 rallied over the following year without looking back, there were another two times, 2001 and 2007, that at the following years' lows, the S&P 500 would end up lower by double-digit percentage points.

736,$AMC earnings analysis by Quant Data,"AMC has an earnings rating of 2, which is significantly more bearish than the Leisure & Recreation industry average of 4.2. AMC scores a bearish 4 or less for all three component ratings. 

AMC's current quarter consensus estimate has decreased over the past 90 days from -0.89 to -0.98, a loss of -9.3%. Consensus estimates for the Leisure & Recreation industry have moved an average -13.0% during the same time period.

737,"Plays on high IV, Memes & AMC","Fair warning, this post is meant to be heavy to digest and some mental fatigue is expected in order to follow along.

The setup: meme stocks are once again pumped (AMC, GME, BB, PLTR, ..). I can't time the peak, but I'd like to make some money on the trip down. Except IV is now through the roof, and when it will inevitably crash, whatever options you bought will loose out on value. It's tricky to find the right play. So let's go through all the different plays we could make and how they compare.

# Assumption

Let's stick with AMC. I'm looking at June 18 expiration options, expecting AMC to be in the $10-$20 range by then. Rally might continue next week, or crash and burn, but I am optimistic 3 weeks from now things should have normalized. Let's build a strategy around that.

# 1) Short stocks

This is the easiest if you time the peak well. An absolute nightmare if next week the rally reignites. It is a) heavy on margin requirements b) has no cap on losses -> **HUGE NONO. Always have a cap on your losses.**

(For those who can't short stocks but can still buy options: replace shorting the stock with synthetic shorts. Tastes just the same.)

# 2) Short stocks + long protective call

AMC closed at \~$26. A $30 strike call costs \~$6.50. So we could go short on 100 shares, long on one $30 strike call. Max loss potential of 100\*$10.5. Expected win, in the very lucky scenario AMC goes to $10, is  100\*$9.5. That's very slim returns on a relatively big potential loss.

Problem of course is the expensive protective call. IV is too high, remember? **We should avoid going long on calls.**

# 3) Long puts

So how about buying puts instead for that sweet, sweet leverage?

(OTM) $20 put goes for $3.65, so breakeven below $16.35 by June 18. Max loss 100\*$3.65. We won't score big, even if AMC trades at 15$ (and that's a 42% drop that can't exactly be guaranteed). But it still offers better odds and better max loss than the previous considerations.

(OTM) $15 put goes for $1.38, so breakeven below $13.62 by June 18. Max loss 100\*$1.38. This would require exceptionally great likelihood for AMC to trade below $13.62 to make it worth the risk. With the assumption of AMC trading between $10 and $20, the $20 put is clearly a better choice.

**So the problem here is the high extrinsic value of the option we need to pony up for the trade. Again, high IV - ruins everything.** Maybe deep ITM options do better?

(ITM) $40 put trades at $18.85, breakeven below $21.15 - pretty good pick for our $10-$20 target. Max loss however is also much bigger now: 100\*$18.85 per contract. The extrinsic value on the contract is $4.85 - still crazy high. The delta on these puts is -0.53. For something that is supposed to be deep ITM, that is extremely problematic.

If AMC hits $15, we make $6.15/share, so an ROI of 32%. But it's quite capital heavy, and max loss is also significantly higher. Once again, problem is the high IV and having to pay huge extrinsic costs -> **going long on puts is so-so.**

# 4) Theta/Vega plays

Going long on calls or puts have huge extrinsic costs - so why not take the other side of the deal and short them? With time passing, the option contract will loose value (theta play). Same if the IV drops (vega play).

Selling naked calls is clearly dangerous, so how about bear call spreads.

A $25 (short)-$30(long) Call spread gives us net credit of 100\*$1.20, max loss of 100\*$3.8. Anything below $25 and we keep the credit.

A $30 (short)-$35(long) Call spread gives us net credit of 100\*$0.87, max loss of 100\*$4.13. Anything below $30 and we keep the credit. That is some excellent looking return for an OTM spread.

Odds are, with IV dropping, these credit spreads will become worthless extremely fast and we can close the deal out.

Similarly, we could play put spreads, but returns are pretty bad. A $10 (short)-$5(long) Put spread gives us net credit of 100\*$0.23, max loss 100\*$4.77. Given that AMC was trading below $10 for most of the year, that seems disproportionately risky.

**Credit spreads. The best play in high IV meme stock situations.**

# 5) Theta/Vega play + Iron Condor

Pretty much as before, just combining credit spreads with put spreads to get an iron condor. If one of your spreads goes under, the other one is at least 'safe', reducing your max loss. However, in this case both Put and Call spreads should net similar credits - otherwise the risk is disproportionate towards one side or the other. Sometimes, this is ok. But with the expectation of a $10-$20 price target, put spreads are really not worth it, making this majestic metal bird unpractical here. **Pass, this time.**

# 6) Modeling probabilities & doing the math

We covered a lot of ground, and some of these plays are pretty decent. Normal people would probably stop here. But not us ;)

When IV is so high, options are priced as if anything could happen. The $40 strike call has a \~0.5 delta: as in, there's a 50% chance AMC will trade above $40 by June 18. That seems terribly ill priced.

If you plot the [option-implied risk neutral distribution](https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/book/rf-publication/2004/rf-v2004-n1-3925-pdf.ashx), you'll get a big, fat curve that sees AMC closing below $10 just as likely as it is to close above $30. In contrast, I am doubling down on my belief that the 'real' expected distribution should be between $10-$20, with about 90% probability. Or if you were to plot these things and slap numbers on it:

[Risk Neutral Distribution vs My prediction](https://preview.redd.it/k41f3294q4271.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ee9252d6596dee5783560ec80bc78d2b7b5ddbb)

The cool thing about distributions is you can calculate exact expected returns and win probabilities, instead of eyeballing these values. **These expected values are based on my prediction of the distribution - if I am completely ducking wrong about it, so are these numbers.** In other words, the math is always correct, but the human behind the forecasting can be an idiot. Expected call returns (if going long; if big red negative number, go short for profit):

[AMC June 18 Calls expected returns \(if going long\)](https://preview.redd.it/2orl2y6hs4271.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=bea779065f644ccccc5499180145e418b076bd35)

Expected put returns (if going long; if big red negative number, go short for profit):

[AMC June 18 Puts expected returns \(if going long\)](https://preview.redd.it/8lgl1g70t4271.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=971dc651be1c81a8650d45c2dd1160e12dba749f)

.. which makes picking the best Put spread so much easier. Picking something green for long leg, something red for the short leg. This way, both legs have overall positive expected returns, but combined for better risk adjusted returns.

The $31 (long) $16 (short) put spread for example for a cost of \~100\*$9.56, expected return of 100\*$2.52, expected ROI 26% , with a 79% of the trade expiring in the positive. Decent trade.

# Conclusion

The main lesson to take away is, when IV is meme-level high, about the only thing certain is that it will come back to normal eventually. Smart money is in trying to take advantage of it. So at the very least, avoid going long during high IV, or get exposure to the underlying via directly buying/shorting stocks if possible.

Common sense can help pick the right option strategy for the right moment, but it's a tedious mental exercise. But for best returns, you probably need to code up your own scripts/deep dive into statistical modeling. I don't think it's really necessary - what matters most is to get the price target and timeframe right. But it certainly helps.

738,Made 2k off amc,So I recently made 2k from amc it was my first time doin option and I don't  want to try it again. Now I'm looking for dividends stocks. Was wondering if there's any stock that ha monthly payout of .25 a share that you guys can recommend me. Im pretty new to investing.,2021-05-29 23:24:43
739,"Please help, math on selling or exercising the option!! (5x)10$ calls at 3.75 exp jan 2022","I want to say first I did alot of reading on options specifically long call options. Somehow I still get confused when trying to breakdown everything.
This is second call I've bought, first expired worthless for 2000 :( didnt need to do math to figure that one out.

So now AMC stock price is at 25.64.

So I see if I sell the option it's currently worth $8,950. I would get that in full minus initial investment of 1875 so profit would be 7075.

If I exercised it I would have to buy the 500 shares for 5k and pay the $1875 contract price, $6875 total, and would have a value of 12,820. Or can I buy the shares with my account value at 8950 minus 5000 minus 1875 leaving 2075 in profit...man I'm lost...

Or, is it, 8950 minus 1875 for the right to purchase 500 shares leaving 7075 profit to use to purchase the shares? So 5000 minus 7075 leaves 2075 plus what 500  shares is worth (12,820), equaling $14,895. That cant be right...lol. Or do I forfeit the entire 8950 when exercising?

My brain hurts

Edit - options on robinhood

Edit 2 - what is the possibility of the option getting assigned on robinhood, and for further info I have 47k (30k profit) in webull in actual shares, what's the best plan of action here on out. I'm guessing just hold both because I believe in fomo/ squeeze happening.

Edit 3 - I see where I was confused, I wasn't adding the 5k to both sides of the equation (option sell and option exercise). No matter what way you add it up it's less money to exercise when ITM.",2021-05-30 04:44:50
740,I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find last weeks post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nj7tco/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!   

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/ke62zgv6o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e3f60366f9ef34f8817f37e3b7482ff8aefd16ce)

Overall, it was a good week for meme stocks in the market. It took a 176% rally in AMC stock price in one week to finally dethrone GME and become the most discussed stock of the week.  GME is a close second and had an exceptional week in the market. Virgin Galactic also made into the top 10 list due to them successfully completing their spaceflight. Another newcomer to the list is BlackBerry. If a stock could run for President, it should probably be BlackBerry as the percentage of people who have a bullish outlook on the stock far outweighs any other stock which is reflected in the sentiment. Electric car makers are still continuing to generate interest following the launch of Ford’s F150 lightning. 

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**  

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kpnkug68o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3049d7b4cafd8bac26ad3f786e7f77c8a8141151)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks in the list.

**Virgin Galactic ($SPCE):** 

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/6b1p1y39o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3a34e83ac860a822742cc83b1ce24b9b5bfa6c17)

No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft (pictured above) reaching space. This marked the company’s first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022. Wall Street analysts have flip-flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33% and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation (a 50% hike). Overall, the company has already reached the consensus 12-month price target of $31.20 and has risen a cool 25% in the last week.

**Beyond Meat($BYND):** The stock has rallied 28% last week mainly following commentary from CNBC's Jim Cramer. On his Mad Money show, Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze. He specifically noted that almost 25% of $BYND shares are held short, setting up a scenario for sharp gains. Since Wednesday, there has been a continuous stream of $BYND YOLO’s and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion.

**BlackBerry($BB):** shares jumped as much as 12% Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks. One important thing to note here is BlackBerry's short interest still remains below 10% of shares outstanding, meaning any short squeeze wouldn't have too much room to run. [This](https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/) article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation.

**NVIDIA($NVDA):** announced a stellar quarter with revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier, and Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. They are projecting a record $6.3B revenue next quarter. The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8.4% this week. Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product, I don’t expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon.

**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** was trending as the stock passed the $1-mark last Friday. For those who are not familiar with the company, it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost $3 within one month last February. With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of $1, interest seems to be picking up.

SOME FAQ’s:

**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also (eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

741,A backtested algorithm for trading meme stocks – 366% on AMC in just under 2 months and 16 trades,"**Introduction**

I recently started working as a contributor on sentimentinvestor’s open source software and I decided to start building algorithms using the data. Given the recent AMC mania I’ll share one that spun a huge return in just under a couple of months. 

For non-devs, I’ll explain conceptually how you can do something like this. For developers, I will also show how to implement this, but (for obvious reasons) I won’t share the codebase, if you want to know please message me (I just don’t want to disseminate it publicly as I want to continue trading with it).

**Also as there is confusion: the model obviously was tested on data that was not used to make it.**

**The Concept** 

I used social media activity (i.e. number of posts, comments etc) from various places to input the data. I suspected (and now confirmed) that activity to some extent preempts price changes for meme stocks. 

While the platform has some better (more precise metrics) for volume, I decided to go for RHI, which is essentially in their words “how much as stock is being talked about compared to usual”. Its calculated by taking the total activity in the past day and dividing by the average daily activity of the past week. 

I chose this metric because it is very clean, although it loses information. 

I compared the graphs of RHI and stock price for various meme stocks and I saw a clear pattern which I decided to build a strategy around. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x59w0atlqa271.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81dc81d3b21a3830ebb2f4c61b4fb96073879729

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4k34hpkmqa271.png?width=868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b26bbb7d889edc9880c915b892b924e2db7a5a98

Here the first graph is RHI and the second is price. Notice the surges around May 13 and of course May 23, the dip around the start of may, peak a couple of days ago and so on

Step 0 (for algotraders only) – clean your data: I used the Sentipy Python module to download historical RHI data. I then cleaned it. I used a simple method of converting RHI datapoints into deltas. RHI comes with an hour on hour granularity so I compared the RHI to what it was a couple of hours ago and saw if it went up, this was stored as a 1, if it decreased it was stored as a 0. 

This gives you a chain of 1s and 0s. This looks something like 00000010000011111111010011111111. Here you can see 2 distinct chains of 0s and 1s with some noise. You need to remove this noise. 

Honestly, how you clean your data is not that important, the above method is primitivebut effective. 

**Step 1: Identify stationary points in RHI**

While the stationary points are consistent we can do better by indentifying points of inflection – as this will give us even more warning. You do this by seeing when the direction of the graph is changing. Sometimes this will be obvious like in the above RHI graph you see around May 23/24 there is a clear inflection point. Of course you would only know this a few hours later in case it is noise. You can set your tolerance for noise as quite low because RHI is very clean. In fact I set mine for only 5 hours as you would have cleaned all the noise. 

**Step 2: Buy or sell**

Now all that’s left is buying and selling when you have set your stationary points. This gave me 16 trades over around 2 months. Of these 15 have been successful yielding about 183% on just buy/sell and double that on margin. 

**End notes**

I have tested this on other meme stocks and while yields have not been as high (the last AMC trade I made yielded 88%) they have been great. I have not tested this on stuff like $AAPL or $GS and I doubt it would be as effective. 

Algotraders take note! - you can make more accurate decisions with less noise tolerance although conversely you get fewer trades in. I tried with a few different scales and they all yielding nearly the same thing. Having said this, the fact that this works macrocopically and at a greater granularity is exciting. 

**Challenges**

Making this work better- since we use RHI which is fairly abstracted we lose information so to speak. Using AHI or raw platform breakdowns have the potential to be even more profitable. If anyone plans on making something like these please hmu as I am interested to see where that could go.",2021-05-30 13:55:13
742,AMC headed for bankruptcy because retail investors?,"Just saw this article on fool.com, and it is interesting for the option play(er) for this topic. (I hope this passes the requirement and will not get removed)

746,HOW TO PLAY AMC FOR DIRT CHEAP,"UPDATE FOR THE WEEK:  mvis, bbby, bb, spce,rblx.  I like bbby the best, but if mvis crosses 19.50-20 mark, it can shoot to 30.

NEW UPDATE FOR THE WEEK:  BBBY ran up to $48 yesterday spiking thier IV, so its not a good buy anymore.  Make sure the IV is below 200%, preferably 100%-150%.  Also Economic data and Feds are speaking on Friday, market will be pretty flat today.  I would wait till friday morning, once the news come in, before jumping into the plays.

If your looking to play AMC using options, you will find out how expensive even the far out of the money strikes are going for. Once you analysis the risk/reward. You will find that playing AMC options is not a great way to make money. The way you go around this is by playing correlated stocks. If you trade spy, you know that as an index, it moves with the market, especially tech, as it comprises 30% or higher of the index. What you might not know is that stocks are also correlated to other similar stocks. For example, if you trade tech, you will find that FB leads the way for alot of the tech stock. The highestcorrelation is FB to MSFT. MSFT will literally mirror FB by a nano second. Stocks such as SNAP and TWTR will also follow FB, but its not as strongly correlated to FB, but is more informed by the moves of FB. I tried out a theory that meme stocks can also be correlated. I took the most recent hype train stocks for my play over AMC. I traded MVIS, SPCE to prove out my theory and also checked other meme stocks such as expr, nok, bb, etc. They all played out similar to amc, however with much lower gains. If your wondering why i choose mvis and spce over the others. Its due to how much air space they had over the others and also the amount of price movement in dollar amounts and not % amounts.",2021-06-01 04:51:12

749,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 1, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.

Last week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as “transitory” and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. 

**Highlights**

* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. 
* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.
* “Meme stocks” continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!
* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets 
* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.

750,Any advice for minimizing losses as this point on a short... and hear me out for those who would rather ridicule for having done so! AMC,"Overall I know the glaring recommendation is stop messing with what I'm not familiar with, but would really like to get back $10k of losses before exiting. If you have the time and patience to listen to my buffoonery...

I was lucky owning AMC before the initial short squeeze. Gained $16k and sold! I was only looking to buy and hold at that time but once something like that happens as a newbie it kind of sticks on your radar. I attributed this gain to luck not just for myself but for most involved really combined with some greed being exploited. So after that and reading it was very unlikely to happen again as hedge funds would be more prepared... well that made a lot of sense to me. So when there were then 2 quicks runs from around $9-12 range then back down and I made about $650 each time in a just a couple days (shorting after $11.5 and covering around $9.50).

This third instance I was just going to to the same, was just looking for a little profit.. but it clearly hasn't worked out the same. And kept buying a little more as it went up. Then all of a sudden the price went from $18 a share to over $30 and I got nervous thinking of these claims of it going up over $100/share... so I cover 800 of the 1700 shares I was short at $34 last week (on the spike up to $36) ...only to see it crash quick. Where then I was pissed I let fear set in as I'm never like that. I compared the price trends/graph on other squeezes and it looked to match other reversals... so that then made me think I was going to be missing out on all the continued price drops that were to come and I was an idiot of paying $34 to cover and I should get those shorts back to at least recoup some of what I would have otherwise if I didn't cover then.... so re-shorted the 800 around $26..... only to see it go back over $32 shortly after, maximizing my current losses in a few steps for nothing.

So now I've lost all my previous gains I made from owning on the first squeeze and the couple shorts a I did after... plus another $10k+. Maybe be even closer to $15k right now. My idea was if I could just skip out on all this volatility and possibility of getting squeezed to oblivion and purchase 1000 shares to hedge if it keeps climbing... I can hold and let things play out and then when we're in a reversal downtrend then close out.

My reason for not simply closing it is because I'd lose my short positions and they're not always available... and I do believe it's going to go down (although I know Reddit is probably not the best place to voice such thoughts without vitriol coming my way). The two previous other instances I shorted I'd say only 10% of my orders went though and I would have to sit there repeatedly trying to get an order to short to go through, rejected for market unavailability. If I close my shorts I could very well be not getting them back if everyone else sees the stock as being in a reversal and want to short as well at that time... I would lose my ability to gain back what I'm down by just closing out now.

No I don't have the ability to place options and looking at the application on Merrill Lunch it doesn't seem like I would qualify.

IDK... I was even thinking of just closing everything out and hoping to regain some loses if there's still room to run, closing and buying 1000 perhaps... but boy would that suck if it went down... taking the loses only to buy and it turn out to be a downtrend. Seeing as I don't mind holding on to for awhile it seems the odds of the price going down are more likely than up. At least at some point where i can exit and reduce some of the loses.

I do appreciate you taking the time to read and any advice. No this isn't my life savings or immediate funds I need to make ends meet, but part of it was vacation money. And I'm fine by missing vacation myself, but this is really making me feel like shit as it was more been about taking my gf somewhere for our two year anniversary, and I've already done tons of planning... just haven't finalize bc of COVID concerns. She's single mom whose deadbeat ex hasn't paid child support in the last year and deserves a vaca too. Really upsets me the idea of not going after talking it up in the past few months... and although I'm sure I still will book the trip as a matter of principle.... I really shouldn't if I don't get back $10k on these 1700 shares. $7 drop would be a blessing. I was looking to so if there was some consult option on Merrill but it looks like on ongoing advisory service not a consult option.

Anyway, thanks for listening and and or anyone who may have something helpful to offer, not simply pointing out the obvious fact I clearly made errors and shouldn't be messing with shorting.",2021-06-01 19:02:30
751,Big Cap vs small Cap oil,"I'm going to used an example of a recent move  I made regarding SU which has made me reconsider my position on big cap oil stocks all together.

I held SU since mid February from Mid $20s until last Thursday when I decided to sell my position and use some of the $ on AMC ( I got FOMO, but it has worked out so far) but also decided to double my position on AAV which I'm very Bullish on.

So, since Thursday when I sold to end of trading today SU made $1.65 per share.

But for one SU share sold I was able to pick up just about 8 @ 3.53 of AAV which in turn made .72 per since to the end of the trading day today.

 So technically for every SU share sold I was able to make $5.70 (.72 x 7.97 ) on AAV.

So, are dividends important anymore when we're dealing with an uptrending oil market, are we better off investing in small cap all together? 

What are your thoughts?",2021-06-01 20:23:23

* [**AMC+22.66%**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC?p=AMC)

(Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment surged another 38% in early deals on Wednesday and were set to open at a record high as individual traders on social media forums were unfazed by a hedge fund flipping its stake in AMC, calling it overvalued.

Hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management sold 8.5 million freshly issued AMC shares at a profit on Tuesday, a source said, immediately after buying them. AMC had earlier said it was prepared to make acquisitions with the new issuance, worth about $230.5 million.

Extending a red hot rally, the cinema operator's stock traded at $41.90 on Wednesday, leading gains among the group of ""meme stocks"" including video game retailer GameStop Corp and BlackBerry Ltd that have attracted the attention of small-time traders on online platforms such as Reddit's WallStreetBets.

""It's not rational, but do not bet against it,"" said a Berlin-based trader.

AMC's stock has surged more than 1,400% this year and, at nearly $42, is trading at more than 10 times the median analyst price target.

The number of messages related to AMC on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits rose more than 7% on Wednesday, with most of them reflecting a positive sentiment.

AMC daily stock trading volumes in the past week have reached their highest since January, according to Refinitiv Eikon, while data from Fidelity showed it continued being the brokerage platform's most traded scrip.

GameStop was up 4.5% in premarket trading, while Koss Corp jumped 13%. BlackBerry's U.S.-listed shares were last up 18.6%, bringing their total yearly gains to more than 75%.

753,AMC to Offer Free Popcorn and Exclusive Screenings for Investors,"Full Article Here: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/amc-plans-to-reward-retail-investors-with-free-popcorn-and-exclusives.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/amc-plans-to-reward-retail-investors-with-free-popcorn-and-exclusives.html)

&#x200B;

**On Wednesday, the movie theater chain launched a new portal on its website just for its retail investors. The site, which requires stockholders to self-identify and sign-up for the chain’s loyalty program, contains “special offers” and company updates.**

One of those special offers is a free tub of popcorn.

AMC’s retail investors have [propped up company since January](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amcs-ceo-wants-to-use-the-meme-frenzy-as-a-springboard-for-growth.html), sending the stock up more than 1,400% in the last five months. Shares were up more than 20% in premarket trading Wednesday. 

The company said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding. Many of them were inspired by the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page to purchase the stock. The forum selected several companies that were being shorted by large hedge fund groups and decided to take action.

CEO Adam Aron has praised these investors for their support. The company delayed its annual shareholders meeting by more than a month in order to give these investors an opportunity to attend the event and “make their important voices heard.”

Aron and AMC both plan to [donate $50,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/amc-ceo-adam-aron-raved-about-its-reddit-investors-on-an-earnings-call.html) — a clear nod to these new investors, who call themselves apes and refer to Aron as “Silverback.” AMC also has shifted its communication style to speak directly with shareholders via social media, including YouTube. Aron has even taken a renewed interest in Twitter, “following” hundreds of accounts tied to the “ape army.”

AMC Investor Connect is the next step in the company’s strategy of connecting with these investors. The platform provides shareholders with exclusive promotions, like free or discounted items and invitations to special screenings, as well as direct communications with Aron.

“During my five-plus year tenure as CEO at AMC, I’ve taken great pride in the relationships I have forged with AMC’s owners,” Aron said in a statement Wednesday**. “With AMC Investor Connect, that effort in relationship building will continue apace even if our shareholders now number in the millions. After all, these people are the owners of AMC, and I work for them.”**",2021-06-02 08:03:20

I have never sold or exercised a call before as everything I’ve purchased in the past expired out of the money so I’m just more curious if it’s more beneficial to sell a few shares and exercise the options or would it be better to let them ride out a bit longer and just sell the call and reinvest them into the stock?

757,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 2, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 2, 2021**

The three major indexes traded roughly flat in an otherwise action-packed day. The rally in the movie-theater company AMC went to another level, with the company gapping up more than 100% today (up roughly 255% in the week, 570% for the month). AMC now has a larger market cap (roughly $30 billion) than Gamestop (GME) ever did at the height of its rally. In other news, market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports. 

The month-long battle between short-sellers and retail investors took another drastic turn, with AMC rocketing up, reaching as high as $72.62 and overtaking Gamestop (GME) in terms of market cap. This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining. Shares of other so-called “meme stocks” that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) gained more than 60% while Naked Brand Group (NAKD) and BlackBerry (BB) were up 28% and 30%, respectively. Shares of Gamestop (GME) were up roughly 13%.

New economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain. The Institute of Supply Management’s headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages. The report found that companies and their suppliers “continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand”, noting that “record lead times, wide scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments.” As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. The ISM's headline index registered a reading of 61.2 in May, an increase from April's reading of 60.7 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector. Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster; readings below indicating contraction. 

However, it’s important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves, material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved. And as supply starts to meet demand, the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down.  In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the near-term. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper.

758,Meme stocks and post-sale regrets,"Purchased AMC stock a few days ago. Sold yesterday. Made a pretty good profit of around 60%. Of course, if I’d stayed in for one extra day, I'd have over doubled my money, and with a higher ceiling likely still to come.

I've heard all the usual talking points in dealing with this; hindsight is 20-20, nobody can really predict in advance where the market's going to go, profits are profits, etc...but even with all of that in mind, I can't help but feel a world of hurt when I think of the additional money I could've brought in. When you’re looking at a nice return it’s a good feeling, but the idea of a phenomenal return as a distinct possibility only a day ago continues to linger in the background, and I don’t know how to get it out.

Keep in mind that this really only applies to meme stocks and some other high volatility assets; the rest (and overwhelming majority) of my portfolio is in long-term index funds, which obvi don't see the type of crazy volatility that I'm referring to barring times of economic downturn; the type of volatility that makes you wonder what if you'd held on for only a day or two longer. I'm sure at least some folks on this forum have gone through the same motions, so I wanted to ask if any of you had advice as to how to successfully put the regrets and the what ifs of selling a skyrocketing security too early out of your mind?

My style of investing is a mixture of Joel Greenblatt, Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet, as well as Peter Lynch and Philip Fisher.

I have been reading on options for about a year. I have read *Understanding Options* by Michael Sincere, I am about to finish *The Options Playbook* by Brian Overby, and have finished reading *The Intelligent Options Investor* by Erik Kobayashi-Solomon. I am also about half way through the course of options trading by the *Options Alpha* website.

I am not interested in many of the complex options trading plays nor am I interested in investing in most stocks such as GME or AMC which I believe are highly speculative and not based on fundamentals but which I believe are mostly simply based on hype or attempts at short-squeezing a stock.

I am more interested in finding stocks that I believe have good fundamentals and that have a lot of growth potential and or dividend stocks. I plan on finding some of these stocks that have unwarranted volatility and that offer good premiums for selling cash secured puts and later on potentially selling covered calls.

I plan on finding such stocks that when I sell cash secured puts will give me a premium of 1% or more return minimum on my cash or in annual terms 12% or more.

A good example of such stock that I currently have a position is VIAC which I sold a monthly option on May 17 for a strike price of $35 with a premium of $73 expiring on 6/18. The reason I thought this was a good choice was because it is offering me a monthly return of about 2.9% or an annual return of about 29% (.75 premium/ 30 options length) \* 12 months.

I think VIAC fits my description of selling cash secured puts because it provides a good monthly premium and is a stock I believe has good fundamentals and it is slightly undervalued. It is a massive tele-com stock with many sports rights which will benefit as COVID restrictions come to an 100% end especially by next year.

For a good overview of my process in selling cash secured puts I reccomend watching this video by Michael Jay [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgifdgyLmNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgifdgyLmNE)

Does anyone else have a similar process and if so what stocks are you currently selling cash secured puts or are planning on doing?

There are some other stocks I would like to do this with but the premiums don't seem as high so I don't want to take the risk for the reward offered.

Once again, I am not planning on doing this with hyped up stocks like AMC or GME but good quality stocks with good premiums for options investing.",2021-06-02 19:58:15
760,I bought subscriptions to social media/sentiment stock data platforms to see which one was the best for algotraders,"Hello everyone,

As anyone active on reddit must know, there are about a million sentiment analysis trackers that have been made in the last 6 months. Given the new and incredible importance in using sentiment analysis and social media tracking trading these days, I wanted to examine which ones are the best for algo traders to use in models. I bought a subscription to the best ones I could find to give an accurate assessment.

Here are the criteria I decided on before ranking them:

1. Data they provide, including granularity, quality, range of sources, and clarity - 4 points
2. Ease of use and access - 3 points
3. Price - 2 points
4. API access - 1 point

After extensive research, I narrowed down the list to the following, 1. SwaggyStocks.com 2. Hypeequity.com 3. [Sentimentinvestor.com](https://sentimentinvestor.com/) 4. social [sentiment.io](https://sentiment.io/). While there are a lot of other tools, these seem to be by far the best equipped ones.

**A) Swaggy stocks -**  [**SwaggyStocks.com**](https://swaggystocks.com/)

Swaggystocks is the darling of Wall Street Bets, famously known for its lack of sophistication. Nevertheless SwaggyStocks has a great interface and its data is easy to follow and use for normal investors.

1. Data: SwaggyStocks is mainly focused around Reddit and WallstreetBets exclusively. Like all the above trackers it provides volume and sentiment data. This data for the most part is updated daily and probably not very useful in any sort of algorithm that looks for nuances. Given that the data also comes from a very limited number of sources it does not seem to be that effective - 1/4
2. Ease of Use: given that the API doesn't seem to exist, as long as you know web scraping using beautiful soup or an equivalent, getting the data isn't that hard. Of course, this isn't as easy as simply using an api call to access data - 1/3
3. Webscraping is free so free - 2/2
4. No API access. This also means that there is no way to access historical data as webscraping is of course done in realtime time. Any sort of data access would have to be stored by yourself - 0/1

Further Comments: they have a good following and the platform is well maintained and provides some sector sorting like weed stocks, spacs: even though this may not be super useful for algo traders we will +1 bonus point

Final Score 5/10

**B) Hype Equity - hypeequity.com**

HypeEquity has got a small but committed group of Redditors using the product. The creator, u/Defektivex, has made some good predictions using the data like predicting the boom of AMC and so forth. While the platform is small (2100-strong subreddit) compared to some of the other ones it packs a big punch with a lot of screening features on the website - but that's not what we are here to discuss!

1. Data: HypeEquity are pretty abstract about the data that they give chatter scores but it isn't all that clear what they mean and where it comes from. It is also hard to tell exactly where the data comes from - clearly reddit - maybe twitter also, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The data also only gets updated daily so again, it probably isn't very useful for algorithms - 2.5/4
2. Ease of use: given that they have an API, this is positive. The documentation isn't fantastic though and the data isn't clear or complete for algortraders - 1.5/3.
3. Price is $25 dollars a month for a pro subscription which also happens to include API calls in it, so not too bad at all - 1.25/2
4. There is an API 1/1

Further Comments: while they are small they seem to expanding fast and show promise. There are a lot of additional data points like price earnings etc, but all of these can be obtained from yahoo finance more easily- which is undoubtedly where hypeequity got them from. For the extra stuff +0.25

Final Score - 6.5/10

**C) Sentiment Investor- sentimentinvestor.com**

Sentiment Investor is clearly oriented to algotraders compared to the others which have a normal retail offering and then a side offering for algortraders. The platform is very small (only about a 300-strong subreddit) it is a strong contender for best data provider for algotraders.

1. Data: By far the best at the moment for two reasons. Firstly it is very granular - hourly, so it actually far more feasible to incorporate this into algorithms. 2. Its better laid out for models- data is broken down from different sources (Reddit multiple subs, twitter, Stocktwits, yahoo finance etc...) into easy to access chunks, and the sources extend significantly further than any other product. They also have useful capstone metrics - the only downside is that these capstone metrics are not that well explained 3.75/4.
2. Ease of Use: very clear documentation, along with packages in Python and JS (Js is probably useless though for traders). 3/3
3. Price is about $12 dollars/mo which isn't so bad and that gives 100000 calls - 1.75/2
4. There is an API (1/1)

Further comments: they have an open source bit which seems pretty useless unless you wanted to add your own models. 0.5 bonus points for that. They also have a database api which allows to access all raw data - tweets comments posts to build models which is fucking fantastic so a bonus point there

Final Score - 10.5/10

**D) Social Sentiment - socialsentiment.io**

This project has been going on the longest and for this reason is probably the most well known. The founder is a developer and states that this is a fun side project, nevertheless it seems to be interesting and doing well. It is also probably the biggest)

1. Data: they provide data from Reddit and Twitter which is a good range. They also have notable posts which means through web scraping you an access these (this requires using a headless browser which is harder than normal scraping though as you require OAuth). On the downside the data is only daily which means it is not that useful to incorporate into algorithms. They have an interesting activity metric which is the sum of upvotes and likes etc rather than number of posts. Its hard to say if this is more or less useful. 3/4
2. Ease of Use: fantastic documentation, although only REST endpoints - 3/3
3. Price- there pro subscription is $15/mo which is decent - 1.75/2
4. There is an API 1/1

Further Comments: They some other stuff on the website where the analyze a few static users but this isn't useful for algotraders

Final Score: 8.75/10

**End notes:** another notable mention goes to quiverquantitative. Unfortunately there social media offering is confined to WSB and seems very poor as it registers stuff like YOLO, APES etc as symbols so I do not trust the data- it does seem more like a side project compared to the others.

**Finally the classic question: wHy cAnT I Do tHiS mYsElf?**

Because it involves storing and analyzing millions of data points every day- for one, everything is far more expensive to run than to just pay a few dollars for an API key. Also do you really think you can do as good a job?

Any amendments, corrections, or ideas stick in the comments and I'll check 'em out!",2021-06-02 20:10:04
761,Beware of what AMC shorts are holding!,"I understand that most people in this thread invest safely and aren't willing to risk their money on a risky play like a short squeeze.

However, I would recommend to everyone to at least acknowledge that a short squeeze is potentially happening, and could potentially continue to happen. What this means is you should be weary of which Hedge Funds are shorting AMC at the moment, AND WHAT THEIR LONG POSITIONS ARE.

If AMC or GME begin to cause Hedge Funds to get margin called and liquidated, we might be in for a flash crash of some of the biggest named stocks.

764,Am I understanding this correctly?,"I want to buy an option on AMC to try it out.

As far as I understand, if I buy 1 call with a strike price of $65 for $12, and the price goes up to $80 tomorrow, I can sell the call for a profit because this now means that I, or someone else, can buy shares at $65 and then be able to sell them for $80.

I feel like I understand options enough but all of the resources I can find online aren't clicking enough.

So would I be right in buying at that strike price?

Or am I off and the strike price is the price that I think the stock will reach? E.g. buy a strike price of $80 while the market price is $65 and if it reaches $80, then I win.

774,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 3, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 3, 2021**

Stocks dipped today, with the three major indexes pulling back after a recent run of gains in the last two weeks. Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May’s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.

Amid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. 

We got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department’s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. 

These reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. 

**Highlights**

* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it’s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other “meme stocks” traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. 
* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. 
* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential ""supply constraints"" beginning in the summer after a ""more robust"" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. 
* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Thursday. This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations

775,My analysis of AMC 11m share sale news,"This morning news about AMC selling 11m shares in open market sent mixed signal and affected AMC stock trading during the first half of the day. As far as I understand 11m shares were  part of 
Sec filing on 4/27/2021 for  43m shares sale, correct?

The actual sale of 11m seem to have happened between 9:36-9:54AM as it seems to coincide with ~$50 per share sale price that was in the news.

Now the news came before market open that caused FUD amongst retail buyers and that caused further price drop from retail sellers. 

So all this was to push the price down? Am I missing something here?

Also I do know this kind of sale can happen anytime as long as there are shares that can be released to market. It does cause dilution but we don’t care about that do we?

781,Should I sell my AMC stocks and go naked with the September 16c I sold?,"As the title says roughly a month ago I sold one call option on my 100 AMC stocks, as I was expecting the sideway trend to continue.

Should I sell my stocks for profit now and hope no one will exercise them until September when they expire(they’d be losing the premium so an early exercise would happen only in extraordinary scenarios), and hope in September they’ll be cheaper than the 50$ I can get for them now?

I have roughly 15k USD in my trading account, I would be fine with losing it, but it’s not clear to me if in case AmC skyrockets to the thousands I would be liable for more than those 15k I’ve put down as margin with my broker (tastyworks).",2021-06-04 10:37:54

**AMC**

(Bloomberg) -- Retail investors in India and South Korea have joined the meme-stock frenzy by piling into **AMC** Entertainment Holdings Inc. through local trading platforms giving them access to U.S. markets.

The money-losing movie-theater chain is among the five most-traded U.S. stocks over the past week on both Vested Finance and Stockal, two India-focused platforms for retail investors to buy U.S. equities. **AMC** Entertainment has accounted for 14% of trades on Vested this week, a greater proportion than Tesla Inc., Shopify Inc. and Facebook Inc.

**AMC** Entertainment closed 18% lower on Thursday after soaring 95% on Wednesday. Its dizzying surge in the past few weeks has pushed its market capitalization briefly above $33 billion. The craze for so-called meme shares such as **AMC** and GameStop Corp. is being fueled by pandemic-led lockdowns and low-fee trading plans that have encouraged new investors into global share markets.

“Due to social media platforms like Reddit, information today travels quickly across borders and an Indian investor is as plugged into the U.S. markets as their counterparts in the U.S.,” said Viram Shah, chief executive officer at Vested in Mumbai. “Some retail Indian investors are driven by news and want to be part of any global trends or movements.”

Sitashwa Srivastava, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Stockal, said that in the last three to five months, “people have been chasing high volatility stocks a lot more. GameStop happened, and now, AMC is of great interest.”

**Korean Favorite**

Korean investors snapped up $225 million of **AMC** shares from Monday through Thursday, according to Korea Securities Depository data. That total is getting close to three times the amount spent on the second-most-purchased counter, Tesla, at $82 million.

A popular online forum among Korean retail investors contained dozens of posts from traders known locally as “ants,” discussing the prospects for **AMC** stock prices, and whether Blackberry Ltd. might replace AMC as the next meme target.

784,A lesson to act. Take profits.,"I saw all the volatility yesterday on AMC. I correctly predicted it would crash but bounce back up...

At $60, I bought a $50put.
At $49, I bought a $52call.

I then proceeded to watched the stock drop to around $35... my put was well ITM. Did I close my put and take around 60% profit? No... I got greedy, waiting for $30.

I then proceeded to watch it go to $67. Did I close my call and profit around 60%? No... I got greedy/dumb and wanted it to hit 69 or 70.

It has now sat around 51 all day and where I could've basically doubled my money yesterday.... my call and my put has now expired worthless.

Luckily, this is only the 3rd option I've ever traded and I'm taking this as a valuable learning experience. Thankfully while the loss isn't great, it's only about 2% of my portfolio so I'll be okay.

TLDR: I correctly predicted what would occur... but greediness caused me to not only miss profits, but lose entire investment.",2021-06-04 18:50:46

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021.

# **AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/04/amc-meme-stocks-could-spark-more-heat-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-await-inflation-news.html)**
*****
> Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting.
*****
> May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected.
*****
> Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January.
*****
> Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%.
*****
> But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market.
*****
> “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention.
*****
> “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC.
*****
> “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.”
*****
> Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814.
*****
> # Watching the inflation signs
> Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory.
*****
> Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year.
*****
> “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.”
*****
> He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed.
*****
> “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.”
*****
> Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market.
*****
> Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected.
*****
> Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking?
*****
> “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca.
*****
> # Taper talk
> The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying.
*****
> After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023.
*****
> Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities.
*****
> “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.”
*****
> For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said.
*****
> There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday.
*****
> G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

> # May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold

> Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors.

> One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery?

> Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions.

> It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways:

> * The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs.

> * The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%.

> * Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases.

> “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.”

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.4.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well.

> The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy.

> Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief.

> For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released.

> # Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months

> S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October.

> We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend.

> # June Swoon?

> Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June:

> * Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse).

> * It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s.

> * The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month.

> * According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June.

> * Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%.

> We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings.

> Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate.

> # Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks

> Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bull.png))**

> In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Neut.png))**

> With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record.

> Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

> # Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month

> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps.

> # Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade

> The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.

> In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift.

> “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.

> Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound.

> # S&P 500 Returns Relative to History

> May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928.

> We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Current-vs-Avg1.png))**

> The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Percentile-Rank1.png))**

> Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window?

> For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

786,WKHS Recent Downtrend Breakout - Important Levels,"After 3 months of downtrending, we finally pushed above the wedge and over the POC (Point of Control)  

&#x200B;

With publicity from WSB and a boom in volume, there is big potential for WKHS to spike to the 20's and higher.  

A bull flag can be identified on the 30 min chart with the end of Friday leaving us sitting on an important level of support.. which is comforting. Monday premarket will be the deciding factor for if we continue higher or potentially drop back into the wedge. We have a gap fill around the 28.00 area, but this is out of the question until we get over 21.03 (Second Target).  

&#x200B;

Here are the levels I am looking at: 

Entry - 13.48 

1st Target - 15.68 

2nd Target - 21.03 

Stop Loss - 12.33  

**Looking at 15c 6/18 exp @ 1.20**

Wait for a bounce off POC and breakout from 30 min bull flag @ 13.48 for entry. This is a simple play, no need to make it complicated!

788,Has this sub become a meme-shilling machine?,"All I see is memes, generic memes, meme stocks, apes, more apes, moon, AMC, WSB, whatever shitco is en vogue for the week. Some of it is funny, most of it is noise or downright annoying.

Are all the mods dead or just taken hostage by an ape? Blink twice for yes.

Because, apparently, textual post needs to have at least 560 characters, but a meme on how much you fucking love a bankrup company is fine for the 100th time, let me echo a section of the AutoMod message: 
“Hello! In an effort to cut down spam and repetitive/short posting which has come as a result of increased publicity, we have temporarily imposed a minimum length of 560 characters on all posts. Due to the massive influx of new subscribers, please share only high quality, well thought posts which add value to our community”

789,"Expected moves for this week: Meme stocks, SPY, Earnings in COUP, CHWY, FCEL, MRVL and more","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished the week inside its expected move, up about 0.5% vs the 1% move options were pricing for the week. The VIX was slightly higher mid week but closed Friday roughly unchanged from the prior week

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$418** as a *bearish consensus* and **$427** as a *bullish consensus*. Expected moves for both QQQ and IWM have compressed since last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** 

* SPY **1%** (same as last week)
* QQQ **1.3%** (less than last week)
* IWM **1.6%** (less than last week)

&#x200B;

### In the News

Meme/short squeeze stocks peaked on Thursday before a pullback into Friday. Options premium tends to spike when the stocks are squeezing higher and compress when the stocks have down days, a dynamic traders should be watchful of when positioning directionally. Expected moves for this week for some of the names in the news:

* **AMC** 40%
* **Gamestop** GME 21%
* **Blackberry** BB 24%
* **Bed Bath and Beyond** BBBY 12%
* **Virgin Galactic** SPCE 10%

### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

Earnings season continues with reports from Gamestop, Chewy, FuelCell, Coupa and more.

MONDAY

**Marvell Technology** MRVL / [Expected Move: **5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/MRVL)[ ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/COUP)/ Recent moves: -12%, -5%, +6%

**Coupa Software** COUP / [Expected Move: **7%** ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/COUP)/ Recent moves: -5%, -3%, -6%

**Stitch Fix** SFIX / [Expected Move: **6%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SFIX) / Recent moves: +3%, -8%, -2%

WEDNESDAY

**Gamestop** GME / [Expected Move: **21%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/GME) / Recent moves: -33%, -19%. -15%

**Restoration Hardware** RH **/** [Expected Move: **8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/RH)[ ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/WMT)**/** Recent moves: +9%, -3%, +20%

THURSDAY

**Chewy** CHWY / [Expected Move: **8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/CHWY) / Recent moves: +5%, -5%, -10%

**FuelCell Energy** FCEL / [Expected Move: **14%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FCEL)[ ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/LMND)/ Recent moves: -9%, +3%, -17%

&#x200B;

Here’s an example of using the expected move to generate an Iron Condor that “sells the move” in GME. The Condor looks to profit if GME stays within its expected move following earnings. It is a max gain between 195 and 297.50. If the stock moves beyond what options are pricing, the Condor is a max loss (with defined risk) below 190 or above 302.50:

Trading directionally can also use the expected move to establish debit spreads to those levels in the stock. Any OTM calls or puts beyond those levels need a stock move beyond what options are pricing. Skew in the meme stocks is off the charts, as retail is reaching for OTM calls in particular way beyond what options are pricing. That can work in a traders favor to sell those OTM options to help finance closer to the money options.

790,AMC Stock Holders - Pitch for AMC Subscription Service - Cable and Streaming - Your Thoughts.,"As we the investors and are now owning 80% of the shares, I wanted to toss an idea out to the group.   


I think that the Big Ten Network or HBO, serves as a great example of how AMC could create a market that requires cables services that gives people a theater experience at home and could really bring a great experience to streaming services. So here is my idea. I am a game dev, so I would like people closer to this industry to take hold of the idea, and drill into how good or bad the idea is and take control of it and see if a pitch could be taken up for review. We could form a team to present and bring it up in a share holders meeting.  (Be actual adults who hold shares, be apart of the process to fix the company)  


So here is the service.   


What do you watch on the service?   
I think we follow the same setup standard TV channels follow with a pattern style of movies at exactly known hours. So people are never surprised about what movies will be on and what time.   


M-F you know exactly what genre of movies come on around what time. TBD what those are by research. During the morning it could be cartoons and then as the mid-day pushes in more old time classics and then I feel every night at 9pm having the prime-time movie.   


Before each prime-time movie you have exactly what you have at a movie theater. Previews of what is coming out at the movies and on our channel on release dates.   
I also did like at Almo draft house they had themes of previews or movie skits before the movie based on the movie that was going to be watched. So for example before It they showed a bunch of really scary clown, old movie clips and cartoons and it was really cool to have this before the show. Could do this before Prime-time, to really give it the attention it deserves.   


Weekend Prime-time moves get more focus and but release movies, the ones that get released the same day as movies in the theaters, get a big half hour of just really pump'd up time before the movie just like in the theaters. With previews and these little skits.   


This is a paid service with cable providers and online streaming services. There is an App, their could be a few channels, AMC Western, AMC Prime and AMC Sci-Fi etc . The idea is to make it a premier channel like HBO.   


Anyway, just an idea, wanted to float it and I am sure someone else has thought about it. But wanted to spin it and see if someone inside that industry could take a hold of the idea and see why this legally or functionally would or wouldnt work. If it could not how could we actually help the company bring more money in? Lets help find solutions, not just sit on the stocks.   


Thanks in advance for any thoughts. Just wanted to give some help if I was able.",2021-06-06 16:43:28

792,"Cleanest + Repeated Options Flow Plays Series # 3 - AMC, CLNE, FUBO, ARKK. FB, FUTU, JMIA","Back with some great plays for everyone. Started [this series about 2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/npjj9c/cleanest_options_flow_from_last_week_great_setups/) in another subreddit and many of the plays have been working extremely well e.g $ZM puts, $ARKK puts, $PAGS calls, $ABNB calls, and a lot more. You can check the previous plays by going to my profile.

Many of these plays are quite short term which is why I'm posting this in this subreddit.

# What is ""Clean + Repeated Flow""?

Any stock where the options flow has a single out of the money contract that dominates the overall flow has what I call ""clean + repeated"" options flow. The flow has to be all ""buys"" with large amounts of premiums being spent on it.

The reason for having this criteria is to find plays where other smart people are expecting the price to increase or decrease significantly, hence the OTM plays only.

Let's go.

# AMC

Let's start with the most famous stock last week with billions of dollars spent on it.  Although this is extremely high risk, there are tons of contracts towards 60-80 strikes for the next 1-2 weeks.  High risk but a lot of possible reward as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ur9lid7ngq371.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=490810004d413777041076a2f21b53a6bcb7dadd

# CLNE

Clean flow here, no puts at all on Friday. Expecting the price to increase by a few dollars by the next few weeks.  Play here is September 17, 13 strike calls.

https://preview.redd.it/te1ouznngq371.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=25e02fbdec04ca06fafed7c704aa6bec2ee67c65

# FUBO

Again, clean flow here towards 28 strike with one trade for the 40 strike.  I like the fact that the sold call was for 28 strike which means that might be the minimum we go next week.  **Play here are 40 calls for 11 November 2021.**

https://preview.redd.it/6hf1za6ogq371.png?width=2126&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95bd8c48f44e558e6049c9cbe6790f00f78bdced

# ARKK

Plenty of puts flow keeps on coming. Growth stocks are making good moves, so these might be hedged positions, but the flow remains bearish on ARKK. Not super high confidence, but it can act as a hedge if it doesn't work out. **Play here is 107 puts for July 16th.**

https://preview.redd.it/sxmofaoogq371.png?width=2127&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6495647e63f6b52e857b323c77576827e561a336

# FB

Heavy short term bullish flow here. I'd expect the price to keep increasing throughout the week.  **Play here is 345 calls for July 16th.**

https://preview.redd.it/zp78ts6pgq371.png?width=2117&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce0c481fa05269dbbbb21aac8c48e60a4b6fbc32

# FUTU

Lots of call buying going on here for the 155 strike. We caught this on Friday, and it has already panned out a bit, but there might still be money to be made here.  **Play  here would be 155 calls for July.**

https://preview.redd.it/iwdns6ppgq371.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bb9910e9e4376bad949c1ef7f40e948c0d61aea1

# JMIA

Someone was very confident in a price increase here. Plenty of orders filled above ask for the 33 strike here.  **Play here is 33 strike for July 16th or June 18th.**

https://preview.redd.it/zzc7cleqgq371.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=10fbe39972d1b17eecdbe53497a0a65ee6631bab

793,The question isn't if AMC will crash it's when will it crash.,"Contrarian plays can be very profitable and an extremely satisfying way to trade or invest. I want to make this post on r/options because I will certainly get banned on Wall Street bets. The hype feels good, people feel they are a part of something bigger. but I want to rain on that parade because I can, after the squeeze the stock will most likely fall, here's my logic, AMC is discounting years of potential earnings into its current stock price, It has negative book value, but that is up for debate because they've sold more stock and can increase their business lifespan, regardless there isnt much that justify this price except short term hype, hence a good short, provided you can stick it out.

If deep ITM puts start getting some more volume, I am seriously considering buying, I don't want to get IV crushed so I'd prefer extrinsic be a very small part of price, I guess I could also sell calls 45 days out, and buy the shares since the calls offset a big chunk of the cost, I can't personally sell naked calls but that is a good option, especially if you have enough cash to roll out incase price sticks around these levels for more time than expected.

&#x200B;

One more thing, people think they are sticking it to the establishment by buying AMC and bankrupting the ""evil"" hedge funds who they perceive as the ones causing manipulation and overall unfair activity. I would say this is not true at all, while bankrupting hedge funds sounds cool, alot of them blow up on their own, and are just sophisticated versions of traders. If anyone is the enemy it is the major investment banks, they are incentivized to take on great risk for great profits while any major losses are paid by the tax payers. when hedge funds fail the economy doesnt tank (with the exception of LTCM, but they were involved with the investment banks) but when investment banks take major losses the financial web tears apart, since everyone is indebted to each other, those guys are the moral hazards, not some 100 employee fund with like 10 billion in AUM, Investment banks sometimes have trillions of dollars In AUM like Goldman. So please understand that a person isnt a crusader for justice by buying AMC, although the hype would make you feel otherwise. This subreddit is pretty sophisticated compared to wall st bets, so I doubt I won't get much hate here, but I welcome those who want to refute these points.",2021-06-07 02:33:20
794,Breaking 100 USD dividend payout this month,"Within this month I will break 100 USD (yearly) dividend returns.

I own 20 stocks, not all of them return dividends and not all of them bought last year (some were bought after some of their payouts).

But within this month I will break 100 USD yearly payout milestone.

I own a few ""value"" stocks that I bought and actually gave me good returns (problem is, I never know when to sell with these so I am just holding) and some AMC for the fun of it.

My yearly dividend for next year (if there are no changes) should be at around 315 USD (if I don't buy any more).

Also, all the numbers I am saying are after 15% tax ( I am not US citizen and we have double tax treaty to reduce at 15%).

My total deposits (total montthly cost summed) is at $8,370.0 while my current portfolio value (at the moment of writing) is $9,975.39

My forward yield is 3.934% pre tax and 3.344% post tax

while on cost is 6.89% pre-tax and 5.86% post tax  


Also, I am 31 years old, started a bit late (compared to some other 18 year olds here) but its never too late to plan for your future I guess",2021-06-07 04:40:36
795,The short-squeeze thesis isn't gonna end well for a lot of you,"I know this might get downvoted, but this has been on my mind for a few days, so here we go: The AMC/GME/BB/XYZ short squeeze strategy that has become prevalent in this subreddit isn't going to work out well for a lot of people.

We as humans are fascinated by asymmetrical returns, I see articles people ""Yoloing"" their life savings on these worthless stocks. Yes, the share price does rise, but don't just believe a handful of people on this subreddit are responsible for it. There are hedge funds that run quant strategies which buy and sell stocks based on momentum alone and would have possibly made a ton of money on the AMC stock price run-up. So the whole narrative that you are going to stick it to ""Hedge funds"" or ""Wall Street"" is just plain wrong.

Another thing you haven't realised is these increased share prices have only allowed company insiders to cash out on their holdings, **all at your expense**.  Don't believe me, go check it out here for yourself. You believe you are doing well saving a dying company, but you are just helping company insiders become rich.

Please always do your own DD, and please apply some common sense, it would go a long way in saving, and eventually making some money.

796,AMC Strangle: How idiotic am I?,"I got approval for advanced margin by TDA this morning and what better way to celebrate by taking her for a spin on one of the most volatile assets available? 

I sold a strangle on AMC this morning for the 130 call and 20 put, total credit: $361 ($348 on the call and $13 on the put) expiring this Friday. I would actually consider buying the stock at $20 for a quick pop back to around $30 so the put doesn't worry me. This is my first naked call ever so it is my only real concern on this trade. 

Am I right to assume that if the stock were to run this week to $130, I could buy 100 shares and cover myself from potential unlimited loss and my b/e would be $133.48? Obviously I would have downside if the stock were to fall from my buy point but I want to make sure my logic is correct here.

Also how stupid am I doing this? I know its very risky as stocks like this can do anything but that juicy super OTM theta is hard to resist.",2021-06-07 10:22:55
797,AMC technical analysis 6/7,"**DISCLAIMER:**  I am retarded and this is not financial advice, and my wife's boyfriend is not a financial advisor. **Credit** for TA at the bottom of the post

EDIT: AMC STOCK is at a record high because of us apes. As a business with no ape backing, it is not worth what it is now. I guess I made it seem like I would be holding post squeeze? That is not the case. I am going to ride the wave up and get out and die in the void of fucking space. Be sure to sell when the profits meet your expectation and do not gamble with money that you cannot afford to lose. 

**Derp:**

We are at a critical point for AMC; either we make it or don't. I have the utmost faith in the community and in all the shareholders that we are going to be able to hold and not succumb to the pressures of major financial entities. I, for one, will not be selling. I have waited 6 months and invested thousands of dollars into an idea and cause that I believe. It is a total success or complete failure for me. I am not saying that it needs to be that way for you, but we can only win this together. I have been reading a lot of varying opinions on the future of AMC stock. From a technical standpoint, we have reached the top. However, if we can develop a strong uptrend, we can win. I just wanna be that guy getting his knob slobbed in the handicap stall in a Wendy's bathroom for once in my miserable cuck life. 

**Technical Analysis:**

We are at a major determining point for AMC First, let's look at the Daily (left side): We hit an RSI of around 96 the second time and are highly oversold. The first time it markets a temporary Top! Normally a stock moves in Waves. We detached from the MAs and are likely to return to the 50 EMA earlier or later. Volume Analyses also show signs of excessive bullish volume we normally see on overshooting tops.

Let's look at a shorter time frame now (4h - right side): We see a weakening RSI. The Trend has not broken down so far, and the 9 ema is still holding. I suggest at least set a stop or Trailing stop below here. The VolumeAnalyses is showing sell signs (red triangle down) In case of a pullback, the first ""Volume support"" is around 15, marking the top of the prior re-accumulation phase. A backtest of the ""last point of support"" is normally needed to confirm the bias and regain strength for the next move. The bullish scenario would be a pullback on low volume that is holding the support zones.

However, Exploring Gann fans. AMC has been respecting the 1:2 and trading in that channel. If the Current low respects the 1:1 trend line, then there's room for a move from 45 to 216 in one day. Not that it will, but that's the ""reasonable"" limit. If it significantly breaks the 1:1, well, then the fun's over, I suppose.

Note: Gann Fan is built using the lows from the 24th and 27th; the connection to the close on Friday is a coincidence.

 ***‘It is extremely tempting to short these stocks, but unless you have huge liquid resources, please try to resist the temptation because these prices can go to unimaginable highs before they settle down to a reasonable valuation, and you may have to cover on the high point.’*** 

Trying to bet against stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings [**AMC,** **23.34%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMC?mod=MW_story_quote) and GameStop Corp. [**GME,** **12.78%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/GME?mod=MW_story_quote), may be a fool’s errand and particularly dangerous in a climate of a meme-stock revolution that has helped to propel the value of socially driven assets into the stratosphere.

Thomas Peterffy, the founder of Interactive Brokers on Monday, during an interview on CNBC’s [“Squawk Box”](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/)said that while it might be extremely tempting to short shares of AMC and others, he would recommend avoiding those stocks altogether.

Shares of AMC were up more than 19% early Monday and have gained 120% so far in June. GameStop shares are up 9.8% on the session and have enjoyed a 22% climb in the month to date.

The investments in AMC and GameStop originally started out as organized short-squeezes by a clutch of individual investors who had identified that a number of companies were heavily shorted by hedge funds and surmised, correctly, that those stocks could be pressured higher if enough buyers collectively swooped in.

The momentum for those assets has continued at an unprecedented level. In the year to date, AMC shares are up 2,555% and those for GameStop have climbed over 1,300% over the period.

By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.42%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) is up over 13% far this year, the S&P 500 [**SPX,** **-0.29%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) has climbed more than 12%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **0.08%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote) has gained more than 7%.

On Friday, Peterffy warned investors, [in an interview with MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/interactive-brokers-founder-says-problem-with-amc-entertainment-memes-peoplewill-lose-a-very-substantial-amount-of-money-11622836260), that investors could lose considerable money betting on meme assets.

Traditional investing, even trading tenets, have been tossed out the window amid the hype over meme stocks, leaving many veterans and strategists to caution that a liquid market, supported by  the Federal Reserve’s easy-money policies, may be helping to inflate bubbles in parts of the market and promote FOMO, or fear of missing out.

That atmosphere is representative of a quote often attributed to financier J.P. Morgan. “Nothing so undermines your financial judgment as the sight of your neighbor getting rich.”",2021-06-07 13:25:11

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY gapping up to all time highs pre market after a rest day yesterday. QQQ and IWM gapping up as well. Healthcare was the leading sector yesterday, Gambling and Biotech were the leading industries, Autos continued to push higher even after being very extended and overbought. Intraday action was fantastic, most setups worked and there plenty of great opportunities. Tons of gap ups pre market. Usually big gap days in the market especially when there are hundreds of gapping stocks leads to profit taking at the open but today could be different because the SPY will probably open at all time highs which is very bullish after being lower for the past month. I will be prepared for anything, and as always look for opportunities long and short if the setups present themselves. If things look too good, I will try to slow myself down a bit, my worst days are almost always on the days where things look too good, I get too aggressive only to get my ass kicked. Patience will always pay off in the market. Look for good setups, volume in trending sectors/stocks and manage risk.

804,"MEME YOLO aka ""Moon"" Trap !!!","Guys, without any other useless introduction, I am seeing a lot of Garbage stocks pumped heavily these past weeks especially this week. I just want to remind that you probably worked hard for those money you're dumping in meme stocks... Please be careful at what and how you're taking every other trade. Last week I saw a trader around here, who sold AMC naked calls and got a margin call for over $600k Today I saw another trader who loaded AMC at over $55 per share for a total of about $250+k

I mean, be careful. Always remember that you're lucky 99 times and only one bad trade can erase your account . PLEASE don't listen to those who are inviting you to have a beer on the moon... they will eventually have their beer in a new Lamborghini purchased on your money that you gonna lose...

Investing in stocks is an art that needs to be treated with passion, awareness and risk.

Edit: P.S. just look how pumpers are down voting and see their comments below... These are those promising ""moon"" and while you're buying Meme stocks at their pick, they are unloading their bags and banking... Just saying...

Here's the unfortunate trader comment:

""I lost this. I doubled down yesterday and it wiped almost my entire account. Lost 650K. I still can’t believe it. This morning it was down 200k and in less than a few minutes it was down 600k. I was closed out. I don’t even know how to recover from this.""

AMC has stabilized the past few days. I'm considering writing a covered call and collecting a nice fat premium with a strike of 70-80 with a strike of June 18.

I think it will fetch around 1k+ on premium. 

Problem is downside, I am still fairly new to options so I'm not sure if there is a better way for downside protection. 

I don't see the stock holding these levels for 1 month, but hey, the market has been ridiculous.

806,Hostess Twinkies ($TWNK) DD,"Last week I saw Hostess Twinkie ($TWNK) mentioned by someone in the daily thread. The ticker caught my eye and inspired me to do some DD into the company. Here is what I found:

* Hostess was taken public after filing and emerging for bankruptcy in 2012. Since then it has has strong revenue growth over the past 20 quarters
* The company is now highly profitable and it has weathered the pandemic well. Gross profit in the past 12 months has been $371 Million, up 39% compared to two years ago.
* Hostess is funneling much of its profits into its business for future growth. It is also rapidly growing its [market share in the Sweet Baked Goods category](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/e20aeeb6-2880-4278-a362-f222573d81f6)
* The company is in the process of reinventing itself and the products it offers. They have announced plans and capital expenditures to break into the morning convenience food market.
* They have also recently expanded their leadership team and appointed [this absolute stud](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2021/05/28/hostess-chief-growth-officer-dan-oleary.html) as their new Chief Growth Officer.
* Altogether this puts TWNK is in the much-coveted position of being both a value (think Warren buffett) and growth (thing Bill hwang) type stock. At the moment, there is no dividend as the company is reinvesting cash into its business for future growth, but there are plans for future stock buybacks in 2022 and beyond.
* ANALysts love the stock. The consensus from analysts is Very Bullish (out of the 11 analysts that have covered the stock, 2 TWNK is a strong buy, 6 say its a buy, and 3 say its a hold.

*Now let’s talk shorts*

* Short interest is 20.77% of the float That’s higher than most meme tickers here (comparable to AMC GME, much higher than BB, WEN, etc). Furthermore, short interest has [increased 44%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TWNK/short-interest/) since the start of January are we’re starting to see a number of pops this spring from [failed to deliver shares](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=TWNK).
* The stock has very low volume right now (only an average of 1.2M shares traded per day). If a squeeze were to happen, at the current volume it would take shorts a month to cover.
* Additionally, 123.67% of all the float is held by institutions, and very little by retail meaning that any significant volume will send the stock flying.
* If TWNK turns into a crusade against shorty, I could see us squeezing to $69. *Right the stock is only at a 2B market cap so there’s plenty of room to grow*

807,The Geo Group is undervalued with price to free cash flow ration of less than 2.,"The Geo group is a company that runs private prisons plain and simple. They also have other segments like ankle monitoring, but the point I am trying to make is that the company is oversold because Biden signed an executive [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/executive-order-reforming-our-incarceration-system-to-eliminate-the-use-of-privately-operated-criminal-detention-facilities/) directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) not to renew its contracts with private prisons. The fact that the president wants to kill private prisons has hurt GEO. Geo also cut their massive 13% dividend causing the stock to crash 20% at one point. Even major banks like Wells Fargo, SunTrust, **Bank** of America, BNP Paribas, Barclays and Fifth Third Bankcorp—have announced they **would** stop financing **private prison** companies after reports of abusive and dangerous conditions in **for-profit prisons** and detention centers spurred public condemnation. Geo also has 3 billion in debt and a hefty 1.7 billion due in 2023. Creditors and I expect this debt to be pushed into 2026 as a compermise with their debt holders. All this bad news has sent GEO to a market cap of 780million. This company has an average annual revenue of 2.3 billion with 150million in earnings annually. The real catch is their very low cashflow to price ratio. The company can produce around 300mill to 200mill a year in free cashflow. With increased immigration at the border the United States is gonna need GEO's services to house immigrats while they wait for court dates, they also have on site court rooms in their facilities. The point is that its all overblown and fear is keeping people from realizing the potential for a good value investment. When there is money to be made, someone will loan to GEO, overseas banks, some private equity firm, its not the end of the world. And to address the contracts that biden is stopping. The order says not to renew existing contracts, OK Biden... Lets make a new one then, problem solved. Like that I just bypassed the order from Biden. Loop holes will form and GEO will find a way.

With this value play I can easily see the market realizing its mistake and go to $12 for a double. Now for the insane speculation that must be acknowledged.  GEO IS THE FOURTH MOST SHORTED STOCK IN THE MARKET AT 35% SHORT INTERESTS. With a market cap of under a billion, this company could explode upward. I looked at Gamestop at $450 it had a $32 billion market cap. AMC at $70was worth $28 billion market cap. IF THE WALL STREET BETS PEOPLE FIND THIS STOCK and it runs to a simular $30 billion market cap, this can return you 40 times your money.

SO there you have it, there is true value here and a speculative side too.",2021-06-09 03:44:59

813,$WWE - Can I get a hell yeah,"Yesterday's action on WWE scared the living shit out of me. I mean, how the fuck does [my one DD on WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/nvibpi/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/) cause a $4.4b stock to move up 11% (~$450m in market cap)? Clearly something must be wrong with the market, right?!

Here's some fun [math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msDuNZyYAIQ#t=41) for you: WWE's IV was 35%. The standard deviation for a daily move (using the rule of 16) is 35/16 = 2.1875%. It moved 11%/2.1875% -- about *five* standard deviations. The odds of that? Roughly 1 in 1.74 million. (Let me know if this is miscalculated).

So how does a 1 in 1.74 million event occur? And, more practically: Why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price?

# The SMELL - high bang for the buck

If you remember my [first post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/nvibpi/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/), I chose this ticker due to it passing the SMELL test:

* **S**hort Interest is high
* **M**arket cap is high
* **E**xtremely Memeable
* **L**ow IV  <-- (implies low volume, as well)
* **L**ow Float

What differentiates WWE from other new meme stocks (CLOV, CLNE, etc) are the Low IV and Low Volume. I'll touch on that in a sec.

First, let's get one thing straight. The bump from yesterday was **definitely** from my original post. To me that's incredible... because I don't even consider that post a wild success:

* It didn't hit the frontpage.
* It was buried a few pages deep for awhile (it got a late start).
* In the end, it garnered 1k upvotes and 230 comments.
* WWE reached something like #25 in mentions on WSB. Meh.
* **Yet, still, caused a *five sigma* move in the stock.** That's pretty good leverage.

I think that's the SMELL at work -- particularly the low IV and low volume. There's just not much liquidity in this stock. Not much of the market cares about it. If they did, then after settling down at $65.00, with volume tapering off.. where were the profit takers? Where were the shorts? **A 10% day with *zero* news, and momentum seemingly fading... and it stays at +10% five sigma levels?**  With a single 1k upvote WSB post?

I'm bullish.

# Show me the memes

Now do me a favor and find some second-generation meme stocks with DD-post numbers that low that have done *anything*. Seriously, I'd be grateful if you find one. I don't think any stock has moved 11%, much less five sigma of its IV, from a single DD before. (Well, maybe CLNE. But it wasn't five sigma, and it was already widely discussed recently before the run-up. I could be wrong here.)

A more typical example: CLF, a new star, a had *several* DD posts yesterday, all raking in *multiple times* the amount of upvotes and comments. And what did CLF do yesterday? Up 14%. With an IV of 60%, a 14% move is 3.2 standard deviations away, or 1 in 1000 odds. All of that attention and it breaks out by an amount 1000x more likely than what happened to WWE.

**WWE got far less attention, but moved a much more significant amount.** See what I'm saying?

Also yesterday, the other second-generation meme tickers were fetching in tens of thousands of upvotes across several posts. They seemed to just hang out. Some dumped. Meanwhile, WWE just hangs out even while the WSB ""trend"" ranking is like [#26](https://www.quiverquant.com/wallstreetbets/) on the rankings. (Scroll down to ""Trend Map"" or Ctrl+F for WWE).  It's mentions count is *way down there* .. below CRSR, BARK, SI, SDC, TWNK, and a bunch of other shit I had no idea anybody still cared about or just started fawning over.

**And, yet, WWE pumped and did not dump.**

> Why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price?

I believe there is simply not much real inflows or outflows in WWE.

Remember, the daily volume on this was generally very low, the IV was very low, and it's 120% insitutionally owned. Nobody trades this, it's not expected to move much, and the shareholders are boomer funds. How many of those institutional owners actually reposition their holdings regularly? I don't think many. At least, not many did yesterday.

The WSB post started reaching obscurity, but WWE held steady at 11% gains -- with literally *no fundamentals* changing from day before. The shorts are being cautious, and the longs are just chilling.

**If you believe that my one shitty little post was enough for what happened yesterday, then you should see that it doesn't take much to move this stock.** With WWEs meme potential, and it being short squeeze season, there's a lot of upside, and not a whole lot of downside (maybe -11%, back down to where it was).

Admittedly surreal to see these.

# tHe sQuEeZE iS nOt sQuOZe

In case any of you are into this for the squeeze potential - 22% of available float - let's discuss. If you don't care about sqeeziness, great, you can skip this.

I don't believe we saw any squeeze yesterday:

* Post market and pre market shows extremely bullish activity.
* MMs and quant algos see an uptick in WWE mentions on ""the bane of our existance""
* Asks for options go up defensively
* Market opens, and plethora of options orders come in. (Not a crazy amount, just 1k upvotes worth). They continually hit the ask and ramp up the volatility.
* MMs are forced to gobble up shares to deltahedge from both the new options, and also the *huge* gap at open, and also the *huge* increase in IV. Remember, based on the prices they've sold the existing OI, this is a *five sigma* event.
* On a stock with hardly any volume to support that.
* Stock wobbles around as the feeding frenzy ensues
* Volumes tapers down, stock holds at +10%

No hockey stick squeeze. No high volume spikes mid day. Thus, I think no margin calls and no covering.

**Furthermore, I'm told Ortex did not show a decrease in shares on loan.** I'll update this tomorrow when that data becomes available.


# Conclusion

It is my opinion that non-retail longs and shorts are just sitting on the sidelines. Not much profit taking, not much shorting, and not much covering. They're all being cautious. Look at institutional ownership of this thing. **120%.** How many of these fund managers are going to reposition their WWE holdings mid-day? Probably not many.

I feel like yesterday's movement was all us, MMs, and HFTs shuffling. Just from one itty bitty 1k upvote post. That's a lot of leverage. The SMELL in real. What happens if this post hits 2k? Or this thing gets memed by others? What happens if shorts actually start to cover? What happens if there's an acquisition?

*But don't kid yourself... this is still speculative.*

I'm now *less* bullish, but not bearish, about:

* A fundamentals based justification of current share price.

I'm now *more* bullish about:

* The impact that visibility here could have on the share price.
* The probability of shorts covering, probably slowly for now, but possibly biting the bullet if we get into the $70s.
* The IV getting more jacked (90% IV is high for this ticker, but low for a meme-stock)

And, lastly, when this thing peaked just after open and you all complained about not getting in: Well, [I felt ugly. I felt stupid. I felt gay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_do8VgY4bqI&t=50s) Sorry about that. My next DD, if I find another SMELLy stock, will be during market hours.

# TLDR

* I'm bullish that a single 1k-upvoted DD on WSB, reaching only #25 most mentioned, was able to move this stock 11% up (+$440m to market cap)... which @ 35% IV is a five sigma event. About 1 in 1.7 million.
* By comparison, CLF had several posts each with ~3k upvotes, 3x the comments, etc, and it saw a 14% move. That's 3.2 sigma move, about 1 in 1000.
* To me that indicates there is not much liquidity in WWE, and the volume yesterday was MMs, HFTs, quant funds, and retail buying options and shares.
* 120% institutional ownership must have a lot of float locked up as well, and they're not in the business of repositioning randomly on a bump with no news.
* Price **held** at +11% -- five sigma above what the market thought this was valued at a day ago, despite no news. Why no sell-off?
* Again -- all this from a single *moderately successful* post.
* To me this reads as bullish: the small visibility on WSBs has a massive impact on the share price. More massive than any other tickers I've seen catch on here lately.
* I saw no signs of covering or margin calls. Neither did Ortex. Still estimate 8m shorted.


# Positions

After yesterday's action, the risk/reward for options is significantly higher. I don't think the IVs are too crazy, yet, but the odds of a 20-bagger are slim unless we see CLF levels of hype. Regardless, I trimmed most of my options, and have left in the $-amount I started with.

Same positions as before, but now evenly spread:

* Jun 18 $65, $70
* Jul 16 $60, $65, $70
* Jan '22 $60
* If this post picks up traction I'll be adding onto the 70s at open.
* I will likely buy many shares at open, as I think the worst case with them is they go down 11% to $58. No biggie.",2021-06-10 09:24:03

815,Why Would Price Go Down if Inflow is Consistently Higher Than Outflow?,"I jumped on the stock bandwagon/hive mind in late Jan/early Feb so I’m new to the stock thing and have been trying to understand how everything works ever since.

One question I haven’t been able to find and answer or explanation for is Inflow and Outflow.

For example on the AMC stock according to the Webull app the Inflow is consistently greater than the outflow but the price of the stock still drops at times.

Inflow vs outflow surely can’t be the only factor I’m that determines a stock price but the basics tell me when there’s more people buying (inflow) the price goes up and more people selling (outflow) price goes down. So if there’s more people buying all the time wouldn’t the price move up a lot more?

Whenever I ask this I get one word answers like “manipulation” “dark pools” “hedgies”. I’d like better explanations though or at least more detailed. Seems too simple an answer to be strictly manipulation.

[Webull Inflow/Outflow 1](https://imgur.com/q8uDLwB)

816,My new strategy - Advice Appreciated!,"Once I discovered cash secured puts, I stopped doing limit orders. I will give an example of a trade I am looking to make which shows my strategy.. 

WKHS - $15.25 right now

I sell 4k cash secured puts at 15 expiring 6-18 - this nets me 1.49 per share = 5960

Stock dips to 14-14.75 and I turn around and sell 2 week out covered calls at 15.50 and get back 1.20-1.90 per share (1.90 if stock shoots up and the call gets executed) this nets me between 5500-7500 roughly... I dont have exact numbers because I dont have the shares yet to sell the call. 

If stock rises I get back the 5960 and dont have to buy shares at 15 and I do another put. Once my put gets executed I sell 2-3 weeks out covered call for .50 cents more than original purchase or even strike price of my exact purchase (since I am getting premium)

The hole I see in this strategy is the stock tanks to $10 and I am stuck buying the puts at $15.... I can see that being an issue. Not sure how to safeguard against that too much. I am not familiar with how to write more options to protect my others. For instance I sold a bunch of amc calls at 15-20 and the stock was at 60 when they expired. I missed 40-45 per share of upside, but in theory I should of bought calls when i saw it running 20-30... I should of bought $40 calls when it broke $20...",2021-06-10 18:18:30

821,"I made an algo that tracks sentiment on Reddit (and trades those stocks). Here's the source code and the sentiment results for this week. I rebalance weekly, but can set rebalance speed to as fast as a couple ticks (although that would be a bit silly)","Here's the [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)!

And here's the [hosted version](https://getquantbase.com/). Note: this is for \*investing\* in the sentiment index. The actual algo that tracks sentiment for you to do it yourself is the source code, and while it works to list out the stuff below, it ain't super pretty

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list.

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK ETFs, or even BB, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic.

&#x200B;

**Results and some stats:**

Right now I'm up 75% YTD, compared to the SP500's 15% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously of course, and I don't claim that this is a great strategy, just one that has been lucky due to 2021's craziness)

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 35% (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown of -8.7%** (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, Reddit sentiment weathered COVID pretty well)

* **Hedge fund Mudrick Capital lost 10% in just a few days amid a recent surge in AMC Entertainment's stock price,** [**the Wall Street Journal reported**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amc-bet-by-hedge-fund-unravels-thanks-to-meme-stock-traders-11623431320)**.**
* **The fund announced earlier this month that it purchased millions of AMC shares and sold them at a profit shortly after.**
* **The fund is still up 12% year-to-date, while shares of AMC are up more than 2,000%**

Hedge fund Mudrick Capital lost 10% in just a few days of trading as shares of meme stock AMC Entertainment spiked to record highs, [**the Wall Street Journal reported**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amc-bet-by-hedge-fund-unravels-thanks-to-meme-stock-traders-11623431320), citing people familiar with the matter.

The losses were driven by call options sold by firm founder Jason Mudrick, according to the WSJ. The position, intended to serve as a downside hedge, ended up backfiring as the stock surged too much, too fast.

The runaway share spike occurred on June 2, when AMC shares rose as much as 127%, to $72.62, well beyond the strike price of $40 for Mudrick's options.

Just one day prior, Mudrick had [**disclosed a $230.5 million purchase of new AMC stock**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amc-stock-price-230-million-stock-sale-mudrick-reddit-wallstreetbets-2021-6-1030482628?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest), then immediately sold those shares at a profit, according to a Bloomberg report. Despite the success of that leg of the overall AMC trade, Mudrick's calls on the stock were still held short, leaving them vulnerable to the June 2 surge, the WSJ found.

Mudrick did close out all options and debt positions on June 2, albeit too late to avoid the squeeze. While the fund did earn a roughly 5% return on the debt, it ended up absorbing a net loss of 5.4% because of the options trade.

Though the fund took a hit amid the surge, it's still up about 12% for the year, the Journal said. Meanwhile, AMC, the world's largest movie theater chain, is up more than 2,000% year-to-date.

Retail traders have been dealing blows to short sellers and hedge funds this year as they've poured into stocks with high short interest rates in order to force a short squeeze. Earlier this year, investors on Reddit's Wall Street Bets led a share price surge in GameStop, which caused short sellers to lose billions.

Amid the renewed meme-stock interest in recent weeks, short sellers have continued to lose money in retail-trader favorites like AMC and GameStop. The meme stock trade has [**scared off many short sellers**](https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-traders-scared-short-sellers-away-amid-meme-stock-squeezes-2021-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) from heavily betting against certain stocks.",2021-06-12 09:45:38
828,My experience with the Moomoo app/brokerage firm and why I wouldn't use it and left.,"I wanted to post this in case anyone is researching the Moomoo app later before they consider opening a brokerage account on it and depositing money. Hopefully this will come up on a search and they'll be able to read about my experience, because not much comes up searching this app now. It's very frustrating to open a brokerage account and deposit money only to discover the app does not provide the services it advertises and claims to do. It turns into a mistake that takes almost one month to correct and get out of and get your money back. You're looking at 5 business days for an ACH deposit to clear. If you want to withdraw, that deposit has to sit in the account another 5 business days (plus a 3 day settlement time if you bought and sold stocks). Another 5 business days for the ACH withdrawal to clear and hit your bank account. And finally another 5 business days to deposit the funds and clear into a new brokerage account. 

Tldr - there's an imgur link in the comments to screenshots of the customer service chat and my options Level. 

	1. Orders do not execute properly, explained below. Notifications for orders don't always work, even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications. 
	
	2. They have no phone number available for customer service. Only chat or email with very inexperienced reps and takes a while to get a response on. 
	- Update on this, I actually talked to someone at Finra and found out brokerage firms are not required to have working phone number available for clients or customer service, which is frankly ridiculous IMO. Someone told me RH doesn't have a phone # either but I don't trade with them for other reasons so can't confirm that. If the internet or app or whatever goes down, or you have a problem difficult to explain via chat/email, you're just stuck. Can't call anyone or access your account in any way.
	
	3. Can't trade options even though they advertise you can and my account was set to Level 4 for options trading, explained more below. Customer service literally told me their system does not support covered calls. They claim to only support long calls or puts but I never could place those trades either. Definitely can't trade any advanced strategy either, spreads, strangles, etc. and I had nothing on margin even though I don't think that should matter for those trades. 
	
	4. No desktop option or interface.
	
	5. Their PDT system doesn't appear to work correctly, never counts or recognized day trades, but that may be a plus for some folks.
	

The Moomoo app is part of Futu which is appears to be an established, reputable, and successful large company. I recently signed up for an account because I really like their UI and the way it's easy to navigate through the stock data, especially the options chains, and you can change the name of the stock shown in the watch list, where I add my basis, which is very handy when selling covered calls and that basis is constantly changing. So as far as using the app for a watch list, that's the only thing I recommend and will continue to do.

	1. Orders do not execute properly. I purchased XX shares of AMC a few weeks ago. I set a stop limit order on Friday, May 28, and have modified it several times to increase the stop and limit prices. The last time I changed it was around closing on Wednesday, June 2, when I increased the stop to 55.50 and limit to 55. Luckily I checked it around 6pm the same day, and I saw the order executed at 5:39pm for 65.36. I did Not get a notification for the trade. I checked the charts on Moomoo, Schwab desktop program, Fidelity, and by tick on Webull, and never see it drop anywhere close to 55.50. I bought back soon after I so I still have my position. But the point is, it shouldn't have executed. Screenshots on imgur link. Please note the time stamps in those are CDT times and the times I reference here are EDT. 
		a. First, I've had accounts with several brokers and have never seen stops trigger after hours. In fact the order instructions on all of those other brokerages stated their stop-loss and stop limit orders would not apply to or be placed during after hours. I could be wrong on that, if anyone has experience otherwise, please let me know. That's actually a feature that I wish was offered. 
		b. When I talked to customer service they didn't even understand what a stop limit was. First, the rep told me I placed two separate orders. Then they told me the stop price of 55.50 was hit at 2:11 pm and the order didn't execute until 5:39pm because I ""had to wait in line behind all of the other orders that were placed before"" mine. On AMC, when the volume that day was through the roof, over 760 million. Obviously I wouldn't, definitely shouldn't, have had to wait hours for a limit sell order under the market price to fill. Plus, the stop wasn't set to 55.50 at 2:11pm, it was at 50.50 And I didn't change it to 55.50 until right before 4:00pm.
		c. I waited hours to speak to a supervisor, and never did, but finally got an email from someone after 3pm the next day. The email included a screenshot of the order book that supposedly shows a sell of 506 shares for 54.54 at 17:39:16.
			i. Note the previous transaction was for 65.36. The 54.54 transaction is red with a down arrow, as is the following transaction for 65.35, even though that's an increase from 54.54.
			ii. Also note, while my sell order filled at 65.36 at 17:39:17 (verified in his email and my trade confirmation), there is no transaction for that amount at that time. The last trade for 65.36 was at 17:39:15. So did my more execute before the supposed 54.54 transaction or did it execute for 65.38, 2 cents more, but I only received 65.36?
			iii. This transaction is marked with a ""U"" while every other one is marked with an ""I"". I'm not sure of the meaning or significance of this letter code. If anyone knows, I'd appreciate the insight. 
		d. Like I mentioned, notifications for order execution don't always work, even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications. Get bombarded by those and don't have many options to limit them to the ones you really do want to see.
		
	2. You can only speak to them through chat or email and they refuse to give a phone number. And they give different customer service email addresses. 
	
	3. Can't trade options even though they advertise you can. I wasn't aware of any broker that does not allow covered calls. Customer service told me I could trade long calls and long puts, but the app would never allow the order to to be placed, always giving me an error. 
		Update: After I originally posted this I looked at my account and saw that Moomoo had my Options Level set to Level 4. Yes that's a 4, not a 3. I've never had an account above a 3, and honestly didn't know what Level 4 was or that it existed. According to their definitions, Level 4 has all the permissions/trading ability as Level 3, plus it allows selling uncovered calls and naked puts. Here it is copied straight from the site. 
			Your option level:  Level 4
				Buying calls
				Buying puts
				Combinations (Coming Soon)
				Selling uncovered puts
				Selling uncovered calls
	
		Of course the last two on the list are trades I would never make, selling naked calls or puts, as those have got to be arguably the riskiest types of trades. But I tried to put in an order anyway to test it for a very cheap option on a very cheap stock, and of course it didn't work. And, I still can't even sell covered calls or buy calls or puts. Go figure. 
	
	4. No desktop option or interface. Self explanatory 
	
	5. PDT - not entirely confirmed, but on the plus side for some people maybe, their PDT count system doesn't appear work either. The system always showed me with 3,3,3,3,3 even after one instance where I sold, bought, sold, bought, sold, bought the same stock in one day.  
		a. I monitored this for several days ago and the counts never changed. Not sure if maybe that's because a couple of those trades were executed in extended hours. I need to learn how the PDT requirements apply to trades executed pre and post market hours. Still, the bought, sold, bought, was during normal hours. The first sell was pre and the last sell and buy were after hours. But all on the same day, it should've at least has one marked off and gone to 2,3,3,3,3.
		b. I still never made 4 day trades in 5 days out of fear that it would start working or was working and their system was incorrectly reporting the count in the app.

That's the gist of it. Sorry for the long post but I hope this helps someone in the future. Happy to answer any questions or hear any explanations as to whether there are legitimate reasons for why I encountered some of these issues.",2021-06-12 16:18:32

830,"I made an algo that tracks sentiment on Reddit (and trades those stocks). Here's the source code and the sentiment results for this week. I rebalance weekly, but can set rebalance speed to as fast as a couple ticks (although that would be a bit silly)","Here's the [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)! Note: this does need to be edited according to your needs (how many of the top you want to invest in, how you want to deploy it, etc.)

And here's an [automated version](https://getquantbase.com/). Note: this is for \*investing\* in the sentiment index. The actual algo that tracks sentiment for you to do it yourself is the source code, and while it works to list out the stuff below, it ain't super pretty

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list.

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK ETFs, or even BB, until they started trending on Reddit.

832,"How do we capitalize off of ""Meme Stock Mania?""","There's so much potential for dealing with the potential correction/further delusional upward valuations of meme stocks, and with new investors flooding the market, I feel that conditions are brewing for a major correction, but I am unsure of how to time it or use it to my advantage. I would short GME and AMC, but I have no idea when they will correct, and also am aware that their stock prices are not driven by fundamentals. I could be paying for months in premiums before I have a shot at any return.

I am definitely keeping my eye on these meme stocks even though I haven't figured out a strategy yet, but am curious as to what everyone is doing about it.

Edit: I thought this was r/stocks not wallstreetbets. This post is 14% upvoted which probably means GME bots are downvoting this post to enforce their trading strategy.

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished the week inside its expected move, up less than a half a percent vs the 1% move options were pricing. The VIX was down on the week and closed on Friday at 15.65, its lowest level since pre-pandemic.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$420** as a *bearish consensus* and **$429** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Expected Moves for This Week**

* QQQ **1.3%** (slightly less than last week)
* IWM **1.6%** (same as last week)

### In the News

Most of the meme stocks finished lower on the week. Options premium tends to spike when the stocks are squeezing higher and compress when the stocks have down days, or begin to go in either direction day to day. This is a dynamic traders should be watchful of when positioning directionally. It is not uncommon for out fo the money puts to lose money on down days in the stock, if vol is compressing. Expected moves for this week, and a comparison to what options were pricing last week.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY and QQQ gapping up pre market, QQQ near all time highs which may act as resistance. We have been seeing plenty of selling over the past 2 months in the SPY with 23 Red days and 17 green days since mid April. Even most of the green days have sold off before going green and closing higher which we even saw on Thursday and Friday as well. Healthcare was the leading sector last week, Luxury goods, Shipping and Solar were the leading industries. Biotech stocks are the main movers pre market. Not many earnings plays today and plenty of gaps which may mean another sell off at the open but be prepared for anything during summer as there are always plenty of fake outs and false breakouts during summer trading. Other than that, business as usual as the market grinds higher. Good luck trading.

836,Beginner Dividend Investor looking for advice,"Hello all,

Just learned about this sub and have been doing quite a bit of reading...I wanted to get some advice and critique on my portfolio currently and see what others may recommend I look to do..I am looking to expand my dividends portion of my investment options.. Main goal is to expand dividends into my future and eventually ""live off"" them. 

My current portfolio consists of the following:

AMD	92 shares
	
AMC	58 shares
	
ARTYX	37.439 shares
	
T	77 shares
	
CRSR	100 shares
	
NIO	500 shares
	
NOG	30 shares
	
NVDA	10 shares
	
SCHD	27 shares
	


As you can see..alot of my portfolio does consist of TECH stocks however not much dividend related stocks that pay out aside from T and SCHD which are newer stocks that Ive recently added this month..majority of my other stocks and shares Ive bought insanely low and really made some nice bucks out of them like NIO, AMD, and NVDA..I'm looking to keep those for the foreseeable future as I really like what they do and where they can go in the future..

I definitely feel like my setup has plenty of tech and could use some more diversity..Opinions and advice on where I should take the next step?",2021-06-14 13:57:29

839,Selling amc calls,"Hey guys I have 50 contracts of 
AMC 10 strike Jan/22 calls, I’ve been selling near future covered calls against it since it hit 20 few days ago, I had no idea it would be at this level. I had rolled it from 20 5/28 to 40 6/18 last week, and I’m wondering if anyone had any experience on selling calls on a stock moves like this? I know it’s best to sell calls against a stock which moves steady up, and I want to know if I need to roll it again on a farther future or roll it on weekly basis. My view on this stock is that it may hit to the moon but it also will drop really sharp on any circumstances.

Thank you guys hope to discuss this with you!",2021-06-15 01:07:45

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY and QQQ gapping up pre market. After being underwater for 1.5 months the QQQ is finally back to all time highs and didn't even slow down at the top of the range. Very bullish action in most of the stocks from the watch list yesterday. Tech was the leading sector yesterday while Consumer Electronics and Semiconductors were the leading industries also still seeing movement in SPACS that moved last year. Pre market there are lots of Biotech stocks moving which is normal during periods where no earnings reports are being released. Not many great gaps this morning, you may need to run a scan at the open to catch stocks moving on volume. Business as usual for active day traders as the market continues to grind higher. In a normal morning I will not need to look further than this list and will eliminate the need to scan altogether. Good luck trading.

844,Buying High IV Underlying to Sell CCs,"As title says, want to throw this out for feedback. 

I've bought into AMC for $59 a share. I've sold a deep ITM call against this position, $40c expiring 7/16 for $25.29. 

My napkin math is this:
My options locks me in at $65.29 a share for profit if AMC rockets:
$40 + $25.29 = 65.29
Break Even is $33.63 at expiry

Thesis is that If AMC tanks I can buy back and capture IV, closing out all positions, potentially capturing around $2k depending on how deep it drills. I start losing money at $40. If it rockets I'm assigned and pocket $629.

Any logic I'm missing here in this play? Used to buying options, not selling. I'm thinking of this as a one off trade, not an investment.

Edit: Thanks guys! Buying puts to hedge against my play to reduce exposure. Next time around gonna sell CSP's, less upfront cost and less complicated.

AMC x100 $59.00

AMC 7/16 write $40c 25.29

AMC 7/16 buy $25p 1.14 x2

Total risk: $405

Potential Gain: $629 for short call if assigned OR if drills capture volatility over time +/- puts difference. See how this goes!",2021-06-15 16:58:24

847,Due Diligence of a stock where all criterias for an SS are met but only needs volume,"First of all i am not a shill, nor am i trying to distract from amc. I think it’s great what you are doing and i wish you all to become millionaires! I am a student at the University of Zurich and am studying Banking & Finance. 

Now at the moment i am looking for a stock that is at the beginning of a squeeze, so we can get the full percentual increase. I am looking for a stock where we would be one of the first to invest in. We would be before fomo and before the hype. 

A new chapter in the short squeeze history. Look at it and even invest a little. You don’t need to sell amc. Market is always moving. First gme, and the people who were promoting amc were shills, now amc and people are calling us shills. It’s about being faster than the other people, and about diversification.

&#x200B;

I truly believe WKHS is one of the best stocks to be in at the moment and here is why:

&#x200B;

1.	Currently it is the most shorted stock holding 53% SI of FF as reported by Ortex.

2.	It also has some hype built around it with and is one of the top mentions on WSB discussion data as reported by Quiverqant.

3.	On top of that, the market cap is very low compared to other companies such as AMC, do not get me wrong I am not trying to downplay other companies but I am just trying to compare it to the legendary meme stock. AMC's market cap is currently 29.63B and WKHS is at only 1.74B. When AMC was at 11.45 it only had a market cap of 5.37B. Also AMC had less short interest more than half of what WKHS has when it popped off from this level. Say WKHS gets similar volume that AMC had, it could increase very strong. If WKHS is at a 20B market cap, which is very likely due to more than double the amount of short interest, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of around $164 per share. Even if it only gets a market cap of 5B, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of $41 per share.

4.	It is easier to move this stock, because there are less shares and a low market cap. It only needs a little volume and can lift off very high. So the probability for it to squeeze even with a little volume is very high.

5.	It isn’t a dying business. It’s a future orientated stock which can bring an impact to the future. They were considered for the USPS Deal, which shows that they are a good company, besides the losses (Every company in the EV Industry isn’t having profit at the beginning, but they are working on it to increase production because demand is here). This Deal blew off due to suspicious circumstances, and the FBI is currently investigating.

&#x200B;

Overall, I see good potential with this stock and I truly believe that this is one of the hottest stocks in the market as of right now! BUT IT NEEDS VOLUME! Not a lot, but it needs some Volume.

Losing money helped me understand a little bit more on what’s a good idea or not, but I keep trying to buy calls expiring same week in order to break even from my last loss. (Obviously dumb lol) anyways I just wanted a reference on what you guys think I should start doing before losing more money.

851,"$XERS - You'll Have Xero Worries With This One, Literally","**XERIS PHARMACEUTICALS**

In short, Xeris pharmaceuticals has created two highly concentrated, non-aqueous formulations that allow for the elimination of reconstitution, the enablement of long-term room temperature stability, the reduction of injection volume, and negates the requirement for intravenous (IV) infusion. This translates into easier to use products that also reduce costs at multiple levels. While already being used at a variety of health centers, the technology was employed to consumers through the Gvoke Syringe and HypoPen, which launched July 2020. By the end of 2020, Gvoke alone had a net sales of $20.2 million. On top of this, continued Gvoke prescription growth was over 350% in 2020. This is just a small sample of what happens when this technology hits consumers. Xeris also has a passion to grow, having already struck Gvoke deals with Israel at the end of 2020.

&#x200B;

**What Is To Come**

**Xeris already grew 2020 revenue by >640% YOY!!!!!** That was mainly driven by the release of two products that were not available until the last half of the year. On top of that, the entire release took place virtually, demonstrating the adaptability of the company. As of May, Xeris had four more products that were in their robust pipeline, three of them that were in Phase 2, and one that was in Phase 1. Many of these products work to manage hypoglycemia and PBH. As of May 24th, 2020, Xeris announced that they were going to acquire Strongbridge Biopharma, innovative leaders in endocrinology and rare diseases. This put Xeris in a new field, showing their commitment to growth, and gave them the ability to load an endocrine product into the pipeline that is currently in Phase 1! Demonstrating the great long-term trajectory of Xeris!

&#x200B;

Xeris already beat 2021 Q1 earnings estimates and is a safe play with 117 total patents globally, of which 14 are U.S. issued. They currently have 96 patent applications pending globally, of which 15 are pending in the U.S, with all patents being owned by Xeris. **MOST IMPORTANTLY, Xeris has Glucagon protection out to 2036.**

[THIS IS WHY GLUCAGON PROTECTION IS SOOOOO BIG](https://preview.redd.it/b65cvzkmhq571.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0dee4b59c745da99dfbd7c31d69cd855e6ab69d1)

&#x200B;

[This massive gap is where WE come into play](https://preview.redd.it/ezdcwhnohq571.png?width=1847&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=23eb69758b11f6f6e00929c2260cca051b131033)

Clearly, this is why the Gvoke has had such great sales and subscription rates so quickly. Xeris basically has a monopolized solution to an underpenetrated glucagon market. In the US alone, Xeris believes that there is \~$4B market opportunity. They make it easy to subscribe, too; doorstep delivery with a $0 copay program.

852,Recommend reading / resources for all levels,"Im starting to become more interested in value investing and would like to read more about it.  Several of the typically recommended books, I’ve read about, aren’t as relevant as they once used to be and therefore im asking this open question about resources that would be more completely relevant to today’s world, rather than books where only one or two chapters might be relevant.

I myself have some experience with investing but not really from any “proper” technique or analysis.

Made my first investment around 2012 and ten years later that’s had a percentage increase of ~5000%. I’ve typically then stuck to investing in index funds and ETFs and have a portfolio split at the moment of 

40% All world ETF
20% All world Index fund
20% Single Stocks

During GME, AMC etc. I have also got involved and made some money with that kind of investing as well.

I would like to understand how I can evaluate my single stock positions so I have a way of determining the risk and potential growth of what I hold and help me to understand / plan potential exit strategies.  So if there are any resources that would be relevant to such topics they’re greatly appreciated.",2021-06-17 11:32:04

854,My DD on RKT and the Options data,"Before we kick this off I would like to admit that I invest in RKT and My mortgage is with UWMC. I like the UWMC play, I am considering playing the possible squeeze tomorrow and RKT as well. We can all make money.

Im not some overly masterful wizard of words that is looking to woo you. I'm going to list the facts Based on the current options data for 6/18.

There are currently 6,157 options currently ITM for RKT. That's great, but what I'm more interested in right now is the 16,381 Options spread out from 20.50 to 22.

9469 of those beautiful Slightly OTM call options are for 20.50!

So let's review because sometimes numbers and reading gets a little overwhelming. 615,700 shares in the money, plus roughly 1.64 million shares that could be bought up if RKT breaks through the massive 20.00 wall the MMs have set up. Not to mention My least favorite, Favorite Part.... RKT is the 5th most shorted stock ATM! 13.91 percent of float with 18.9 million Short interest and one day to cover!

They can NOT have this break that 20.00 wall. It would mean RKT has the possibility to ignite another gamma squeeze/short squeeze!

Another thing that's been happening since the beginning all the way back in February and march when RKT GAMMAED to 45 is that everytime one of the BIG 2, GME AND AMC, breakout RKT and multiple other stocks breakout out(obviously to a lesser extent).

I firmly believe AMC will hit 70s again tomorrow, if that happens the gamma will happen by default. Not to mention CLNE GME AND UWMC.

856,EGLX - leading eSports company is way over shorted,"First, let me be clear. I am NOT a GME and AMC ape. To be honest, I hate that crowd and the way they approach investing. I am not an ambulance chaser jumping on struggling companies in hopes that some dumb reddit trend will make me a quick 10%.

But that does not change the facts about what is going on right now. Enthusiast Gaming, the leading eSports organization in North America (*as measured social reach, web traffic and revenue*) is being shorted to death.

After an epic, fundamentals driven rally from $1 to $8.80, the stock has been beaten down to $6.50.

It's very important to note that **the rally was not a senseless meme pump**. The company's **revenue grew from $15m per year to $127m**. They also announced a litany of high profile fortune 500 and government clients that hired them. The company is not fluff.

If the company is doing okay, then how come it's down so much? Well the catalyst that kicked off the downtrend was their announcement of share sales. As a newly registered Nasdaq company, they had to file forms with the SEC that would allow them to sell shares over the next 25 months. That process took a few weeks to complete before they could close a deal.

During that time, the shorts have had their way with EGLX. You can see a detailed chart of shorting activity over the past several weeks here:  [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX)

The company has a tiny little market cap and the stock volume has been relatively low. A small number of short sellers have been able to exercise extreme market power over this company.

But now they have overstayed their welcome. They have raised the capital and the financials are sound. The company's actual business is doing great and the industry will continue booming.

Every single morning since the deal closed, EGLX has tried pumping back up, and then it settles down. But the stock selling pressure is not coming from long term holders giving up their positions. It is coming from short sellers trying to make a quick buck at the expense of a great Canadian company.

# According to this source, short interest was 38% yesterday.

[https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX)

I am willing to bet the short interest will be even higher on Monday. The stock started popping off this morning and then fell precipitously again.

But how do I know this company isn't just dog doodoo and shareholders are dumping?

Look at the cost to borrow: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx](https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx)

# This shorting is costing the shorts 9%! Compare that to AMC's 1.16% and GME's 0.59% short borrowing cost.

Get wrecked.

This high cost to borrow means a couple things:

1. There is an extremely high number of short sellers compared to people who are willing to lend out their shares. That indicates its over shorted and holders are hodling.
2. It also means this is costing them ALOT every day this stock doesn't go down further.

Now, if this company was a steaming pile of trash that isn't making money, I would say the shorts will just kill EGLX and win the day. I do NOT advocate in investing in dying companies in hopes of some bogus short squeeze.

But EGLX will not die. It is genuinely a great long term opportunity, and the bears have gotten ahead of themselves on this one. This company is here to stay, for a number of obvious reasons.

**Reason 1: Common sense:**

The eSports and gaming industry is growing and these guys have developed a real business out of it. They are doing business with: TikTok, Samsung, ATVI, EA, President Biden's Campaign, the US military, Ad Council, Disney, Bell, Nintendo etc etc. What's more, they are producing results for them. Take a scroll through the luminosity LGLoyal twitch page, and you can see that EGLX has been getting about a million views on every single video with the program they developed with TikTok. TikTok has already indicated they intend to continue to do business with EGLX.

**Reason 2: They have cash:**

They just successfully raised another $44m in cash. Looking at their recent financials, I think that probably puts them around $60m cash in the bank right now. They are not going to run out of liquidity. They are not some business on the verge of bankruptcy, desperate for funding and debt.

**Reason 3: They are NOT overpriced:**

In a market where most high volatility growth names like say Palantir, Zoom, BB, Score, Tesla, Dkng etc are all trading at like a 10-50X price to sales ratio, EGLX is sitting at a measly 6.5 price to sales. That is a tad high when you compare it to stable value stocks in the Berkshire portfolio, but honestly it's PEANUTS for a growth stock in a hot industry that just expanded their revenue ten fold.

Fed Official Touts Early Interest Rate Hike

St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard raised the prospects of interest rates rising sooner than expected amid current inflation trends.
Bullard sees an initial interest rate increase happening in 2022 if inflation picks up. This would be earlier than announced by the Federal Open Market Committee this week. The committee's consensus outlook was for up to two hikes in 2023.

""We're expecting a good year, a good reopening. But this is a bigger year than we were expecting, more inflation than we were expecting,"" Bullard told CNBC. ""I think it's natural that we've tilted a little bit more hawkish here to contain inflationary pressures.""

Nasdaq, S&P 500 Fall

The Nasdaq was faring better than the other major indexes, but still fell around 0.6%. Leaderboard stock DocuSign (DOCU) was faring best, rising more than 5%. Micron Technology (MU) fell most, dipping around 4.5%.
The broad-based S&P 500 was also struggling, dipping around 0.9%. Power generator stock Generac (GNRC), another Leaderboard name, fared best with a 3% gain. Investment stock Lincoln National (LNC) was one of the main laggards, falling more than 4%.

Microsoft (MSFT) was one of the top components, but still dipped 0.2%. The Leaderboard stock is trying to reach a new buy point of 263.29.
Caterpillar (CAT) was the only component posting a gain, though this was a miserly 0.4%. Chip giant Intel (INTC) was the worst laggard, falling more than 3%.

AMC Stock Shows Strength

AMC stock was swimming against the tide Friday, and was managing to post a gain of almost 2%.
It is continuing to recover from Wednesday's steep drop, and is on track to post a whopping weekly gain of almost 25%.

AMC stock is currently more than 500% above its 200-day moving average. When a stock rises 70% to 100% above its 200-day line, it's usually a sign of a climax run. All bets are off with this particular stock, however.

860,$CLOV- Serious Discussion: Is this stock the actual dark horse.. AMC & GME prepared us for???,"Is CLOV the true Dark Horse???

The technical setup:

It is rumored that over 50% of the available float is current shorted. However there is evidence 95% of the available float is in shorted-interests positions. The reason for the in discrepancy is because of they way they are counting Greenoaks capital’s holdings.

Greenoak’s shares are being counted and listed as a part of the available 155m float, however it has been uncovered that Greenoaks holds 93m in Class B shares that are convertible to class A. None of the shares have been converted, the paper work to covert the shares has not been filed and the shares are not currently available. At the same time these facts have surfaced,  there has been a big and coordinated push to suppress CLOV from trending. FUD has ran rampant this 1.5 weeks… it raised eyebrows when BoA coincidentally downgraded the stock.. as momentum began to spike up…. It should be noted that BoA has a decent short-interest position… 

Connecting the dots…

In recent weeks as institutions have been under the radar adding and accumulating short positions in growth sectors  on a separate but related trending topic “inflation” we have been witness to wall-street has been sounding the dog-whistle about inflation and how it’s not transitory. Those of you who know the markets and understand cyclicals know that these institutions and HF managers have been  in collusion on convincing the FED to raise rates….They know that would cause a market cool down to promote a rotation out of growth sectors. This is an efforts to drive the sector down so they can successfully close positions and make money on the pullback. The fed didn’t raise rates and those institutions and funds that prematurely took positions are nervous that they could be the next Melvin Capital if they get over leveraged in short-interest positions… 

Digging into the #’s

CLOV short interest is speculated to be above 90%.. but even at reported levels of +50% the stock is way over shorted,  if/when that  information gets out it will warrant a feeding aka buying frenzy.. 

I challenge everyone to take a little time and do your own DD.. 

Here is the Link to the 13G SEC filing that show Greenoaks Capital Partners shares as class b:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001801170/000090266421001020/p21-0536sc13g.htm

Giving further validity to this, it is rumored that CLOV was left off the 2021 Russell 2000 rebalance list due to not having enough voting shares available among its current common stock float 

Nasdaq List 184 institutional holders:

156,065,359 total shares held 
96,331,338 shares held by Greenoaks capital 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/institutional-holdings

If DD is correct that means only: 59,734,021 available float

Short interest on 5/28 was reported at 41,274,556

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/short-interest

That equates to 69.09 % it is rumored that short interest has increased 5-15% over the first 2 weeks of June.. those numbers should be out Monday.

 It makes me think that we have only seen a FRACTION of what is really hidden behind the reported numbers.

861,Options play for meme stocks?,"I've tried many different option plays on meme stocks and I've only been burnt.  like dumpster fire burnt.   Any recommendations on a play that works?

I've tried calls on Game Stop. Cost way too much and well let's just say my timing was way off.  

I've tried covered calls on A M C and well as Theta gang says is,  ""It works great until it doesn't."" Luckily, I watch these like a hawk (or a bored remote working corporate drone) and got out before I blew up my account.  

I've even tried puts on A M C getting a lot before the recent spike at a decent IV, but unlike the last time the price is holding high for significantly longer than expected.  Now I have tons of $20/ Dec2021 puts that are just bleeding.  Don't get me going on my July puts. I donated those tendies. 

 I'm pretty sure a certain subredfit is going to pump WKHS again but IV is already pretty high: 135%: https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/WKHS/IV/ .  I'm not a sophisticated options player but maybe a some sophisticated spread is a better bet? The optimizer etrade gives me are dumb.  I know enough to know that. 

Also,  if you're an angry person and feel the need to call me a shill, just substitute WKHS for any meme stock and save us all the drama.  I'm just trying to find the right play for these high volitility  stocks that I do not want to hold for 5 years. 

TLDR: I want to get one meme stock play right this year and I'd like to try it on WKHS. Ideas?

Edit: this community is great,  thank you for sharing all the great plays.",2021-06-20 12:48:08

**Outlook/Game Plan:**  SPY and QQQ inside of Friday's range pre-market after selling off again Friday. SPY is underneath the 50 day moving average and underneath the last previous pivot on the daily chart. QQQ is still above all it's averages, short and long term. Ideally, we would like to see SPY hold this area, fill the gap it just made Friday and then continue higher but not sure if we'll get it or not. Next major support on SPY is around the 405 area. Not many earnings being released this week so again we will have to focus on other types of news catalysts and continue to run scans after the open to catch volume and heavy movers. Technology was the leading sector last week, Solar and Software - Application were the top 2 leading industries. If the market does continue to sell off then I'll be watching UVXY for long setups. Other than that, business as usual. If you need any help or have any questions, shoot me a message. Good luck out there.

The[ latest rally in meme stocks](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-squeeze-51622060656?mod=article_inline) has given [AMC Entertainment](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMC?mod=MW_story_quote) and [GameStop](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/GME?mod=MW_story_quote) the biggest and third-largest market capitalizations among companies in the [Russell 2000](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/RUT?mod=MW_story_quote) index of small companies. The Russell indexes’ annual reconstitution is coming up next week, so investors have been wondering it the pair might [graduate](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/amc-and-gamestop-are-taking-over-these-small-cap-etfs-51622756046?mod=article_inline) into the large-cap [Russell 1000](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/RUI?mod=MW_story_quote).

That was decided long before the latest upsurge in meme stocks. Although the Russell reconstitution will take place after the market closes on June 25, the changes in each index’s members were determined based market caps as of May 7. In order to move into the Russell 1000 index, an existing Russell 2000 member would need to have had a market cap exceeding $7.3 billion that day, according to Catherine Yoshimoto, director of product management at FTSE Russell.

That means GameStop (ticker: GME), with its $11.2 billion market cap on the ranking day, qualifies to join the large-cap universe. AMC, at just $4.3 billion on May 7, fell short. GameStop’s share price has gone up by 38% since May 7, while AMC’s has increased 480%. AMC has also issued stock since then, lifting its market cap still further.  

The pair’s diverging paths may make a difference to the stocks’ performances. To start with, GameStop stock is likely to face selling pressure from index funds. On June 28, all the Russell 2000 funds will have to sell the stock as it leaves the small-cap universe, while the Russell 1000 funds will be buying.

Although there is three times as much money in passive funds tracking the Russell 1000’s broad, value, and growth indexes as in those tracking the Russell 2000 indexes, GameStop’s weight in the large-cap indexes would be very small. The Russell 1000 includes megacompanies such as Apple (AAPL) and [Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MSFT?mod=MW_story_quote) (MSFT).

That means that overall, there would be more selling than buying. Based on GameStop’s current free-float market cap, the stock will likely account for just a few hundredths of a percent of the Russell 1000, down from nearly half a percent in the Russell 2000. Jefferies strategist Steven DeSanctis estimates that net selling of GameStop stock by index-funds will be about 5 million shares, about half of the stock’s average daily volume over the past 30 days.

As GameStop becomes a small fish in a big pool, its influence on active managers will also diminish. “Large-cap managers don’t need to own the smaller names,” says DeSanctis, “While in Russell 2000, because it’s a bigger name, small-cap managers have to pay attention to the stock.” Historically, stocks that have moved from the Russell 2000 to Russell 1000 have tended to lag behind the small-cap index over the next year, he says.

On the other hand, AMC will play a far bigger role in the Russell 2000. If its market cap remains at its current level around $28 billion, the stock will likely be the largest member of the Russell 2000 after the rebalancing. The next-largest name in the reconstituted index, likely [Ovintiv](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/OVV?mod=MW_story_quote) (OVV), has a market capitalization of just $8.3 billion.

“The definition of small has been skewed,” says DeSanctis. 

AMC now makes up about 0.74% of the Russell 2000. “It’s a small weight, but if the stock is up thousands of percent, it would still impact performance,” says DeSanctis. Active managers of small-cap funds would have to make a difficult choice: Either [stick to investing according to the fundamentals and ignore the meme stock](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/funds-meme-stocks-51622853015), or add the name to limit the risk of deviating from the benchmark.

# Psychology

I'm still holding onto losers too long and cutting my winners too short. If you follow the trades I made closely you'll see that the winning trades typically had much more upside and the losing trades I had the opportunity to escape with a small profit or break even trade and held on for way too long.

This is accidentally turning me into a swing trader at times and I blame SPCE for that. Prior to SPCE taking off again, I was very disciplined with my trades, but once I started trading SPCE again, I got used to holding bags if I took a bad entry and exiting a week later. For whatever reason that mindset moved into different stocks which I should have recognized as problematic but didn't before it was too late. So I gave back a decent amount of gains and lost out on even more profits like this. 

While it was still a good week, I wasn't completely pleased with my performance. It could have been a much, much better week had I stuck to my strategy in a more disciplined manner.

# Software

I'm still absolutely loving TradesViz as my journaling software.

I'm still using TradeStation and the more I play with it the more I fall in love. I haven't tried many different pieces of software in terms of daytrading but with the ones I have tried this is without a doubt my favorite.

865,“Too good to be true” options trade… Need help.,"UPDATE 6/29: I have closed out of the position for a profit of $1,128. Thank you all for your feedback. This was my first time trading naked options and I think I’ll try more short strangles in the future. 

I still haven’t exactly figured out the reason for the astronomical collateral requirements that were involved in this trade and why taking a simultaneous long and short positions reduced collateral requirements. If I get answer from Fidelity then I’ll respond to the few people that asked about that.

….

I have been trading stocks for 7 years but have only been trading options for 5 months. From what I can decipher, I feel like yesterday I entered into a position that “literally cannot go tits up” (RIP OG WSB). From what I have observed, this sub offers excellent insight and I believe I could learn something from your opinions on my positions.

Yesterday I sold AMC 65c 7/16 for $12.10/share and simultaneously sold AMC 44p 7/16 for $7.55/share. Immediately afterwards I entered a 100 share long position for AMC at $56.70 and a -100 share short position for $56.40 (ate the spread). I took these (almost) net-neutral positions because it reduces the margin impact of my trades (How come? Idk ask Fidelity). [Note: all positions are per-unitized to a 100-share basis to make the math easier]

Here is my conundrum: the following AMC price points are important to my position: $84.65, $77.10, $65.00, $44.00, $36.45, and $24.35. 
From what I understand, if the price of AMC stays between $44 and $65, I’ll be able to capture the $1965 in premium minus $35 from closing my near-neutral long-short position minus the spread at that time.
If the price of AMC increases beyond $77.10 or I get assigned beyond $65, I plan to close all positions. If the price decreases below $36.45 or I get assigned at $44, I plan on closing all positions. Closing at $77.10, I stand to make $720 minus the cost of closing my puts+unassigned calls minus the spread of closing my long-short position. Closing at $36.45, I stand to make $1175 minus the cost of closing my calls+unassigned puts minus the spread.
$84.65 and $24.35 guarantee losses on my positions, hence why I plan on closing at $77.10 or $36.45 regardless of what happens.

I think(?) the only way I get screwed on this position is if the price cranks to $77.10 or to $36.45 very quickly in the next week or so and my options are costly to close out because of high IV. If it doesn’t, then I profit off of theta decay and ride a $1930 gain per $10,900 in posted collateral over a <4 week period.

This kind of projected profit off such a wide price range feels too good to be true. I feel like I am being naive and I would like to know how this trade could screw me. Thank you.

867,CLNE - A very promising long term stock,"Hello people of r/stocks! Recently there has been a push to promote CLNE on WSB but I think the members of this community should be our target audience. I’ve been seeing so many people say CLNE “to the moon” or stress about one bad day of trading and if you’re looking for the “next” AMC you’re not being realistic by buying into CLNE. This is a company that is still trying to build its infrastructure, and major changes like converting freight from diesel to RNG will take time. I am very optimistic about this stock though due to the Amazon warrant and previous stocks that had warrants executed under this circumstance.


I’m a certified idiot so take all of this information with that in mind but three companies that Amazon previously executed warrants for make me believe the growth potential for this could be very enticing in the long term.


KRNT had a warrant price of $13.03 and it’s value as I type this is $119

PLUG had a $1.20 warrant and at the time of execution it was valued at $60(now at $34.25)

ATSG had a warrant for $9.73 and at the time of execution it was at $30(now at $23.24)


With CLNE’s warrant being at $13.49 and Amazon’s investment track record I’m feeling very comfortable just buying and holding as the company continues to develop it’s infrastructure and I think anyone that is looking for long term gains should do some research into this stock.

TLDR: CLNE is an undervalued stock that in my opinion is a buy and HODL. It has been making big pushes to solidify its infrastructure and has added valuable partners in Amazon and BP.


I am not a financial adviser and take this post with that discretion in mind.

&nbsp;

What’s poppin’ fellas, hope you’re all doing well. Today, I’m gonna teach you all about ***Collateral Trades***. Collateral trades provide us with an interesting way to dynamically adjust our risk profiles while placing trades and generate an edge while doing so! This strategy is most effective around earnings when IV is high, or if you want to safely play meme stocks. That being said, it can still find it’s application during regular trading conditions as well. Let's get into it!

&nbsp;

---

#What is a Collateral Trade?

In its simplest terms, a collateral trade is a trade where you play a different ticker in the same sector as the one you initially planned on playing, ideally around a big event such as earnings. Since stocks within a sector generally tend to put up similar numbers and move together around earnings, we can abuse this to give us a more favourable risk to reward profile on our trades. 

&nbsp;

For example, let’s say that I’m bullish on $JPM, and they report earnings this week. Instead of playing options on $JPM, I’d look to make a play on $WFC, $BAC, or any other bank who reports earnings *after* $JPM instead. This allows us to reap most, if not all of the rewards if our trade goes in the direction we were anticipating, while severely mitigating our downside risk in the event that we were wrong.

&nbsp;

---

#How does it work? What are the benefits?

Let’s walk through both situations! I'll continue to use the financial sector  in my first couple of examples.

&nbsp;

**If I were to play standard options on $JPM**, I’d be paying a pretty hefty premium because IV is high, and I would instantly get IV crushed right out the gate regardless of how $JPM performs. Furthermore, if $JPM moves in the *opposite* direction that I was anticipating, the value of my options would quickly approach 0, and I wouldn’t be able to recoup much if any of my losses. If $JPM moves in the right direction, it would need to move enough to offset the IV crush of earnings, while also bringing in enough money to make the coinflip we call “trading earnings” worthwhile. Realistically, you’ve got a 50/50 shot at winning, but very rarely do you actually double your money off of a play like this. You’re essentially playing a coin flip game where if it’s heads, you lose 200$, but if it's tails, you win 50$. It’s not a good look overall, but you still have the opportunity to make money nonetheless.

&nbsp;

**What if we were to employ some form of collateral play instead?** Instead of playing $JPM directly, let’s play a ticker within the same sector as it who reports earnings *afterwards* - I’ll use $WFC as an example. Generally speaking, stocks within a sector tend to move in tandem with one another price wise, while also putting up similar numbers to each other. It’s very rare to see some stocks rally while others tank - generally they all rally or all tank depending on various market conditions. This also means that if certain stocks within a sector report earnings *before* the others, the market will price the *other* stocks differently following reported earnings from the first batch. If $JPM reports stellar earnings and rallies 4% as a result, $WFC and the other non-reporting banks will almost *always* follow suit and rally as the market prices in a good earnings beforehand from them as well. If we were holding $WFC calls, we would reap the rewards of a 4% rally ***without*** the IV crush, which means more gains in our pocket. Hypothetically, our $JPM calls may have only netted us 40% gain after the IV crush, but our $WFC calls would’ve netted us an upwards of 100% if not more. 

&nbsp;

**The same is true but on the flipside**. Let’s say $JPM tanks on earnings. Our $JPM calls would swiftly approach 0. The other banks would also follow suit, but to a lesser degree. If we had $WFC calls instead, the IV on our contracts would actually go *up* by a decent amount. This would help offset our losses and we wouldn’t have gotten IV crushed in the process. This in turn means that if we do want to bail out of the trade, we can recoup most if not all of our losses, which is extremely beneficial from a capital preservation standpoint.

&nbsp;

**By utilizing a collateral play like this, we can increase the return of our winners, while simultaneously minimizing the losses of our losers.**

&nbsp;

---

#How can I incorporate them into my own Trades?

I found that there’s three ways you can consistently incorporate collateral trades into your own plays!

&nbsp;

The first method is the one I went over above. **Find a set of tickers within the same sector who report earnings during the same week but on different days**. Instead of playing the ticker you have strong conviction on, play any of the adjacent tickers to avoid IV crush and reap any rewards you would’ve gotten otherwise.

&nbsp;

The second method is a little different. If you have a strong conviction on a certain sector as a whole, you can actually **look to make a play an an ETF which holds all of the reporting tickers instead**. ETFs are less susceptible to IV crush, generally have cheaper options, and always have a much lower IV than the individual tickers that they hold. I’ve been using the financial sector for my examples, so I’ll continue to roll with that. A few weeks ago, to kick off earnings season, 7 of the largest american banks were set to report earnings the same week as each other. Coincidentally, $XLF consists of 7 of the largest american banks. Every single bank usually sits at an IV of around 20%, but around earnings season, this gets jacked up to around 65%ish, resulting in options becoming 300% more expensive. At the same time, $XLF went from around 12% to 20%, meaning that options only got 66% more expensive. Since we know that tickers within the same sector move in tandem with each other, if we wanted to place a bet on an *individual* bank, we’d actually be better off playing $XLF, since the options are cheaper, the IV is lower, and we can almost be certain that it will move as much as all the other banks will. If I was bullish on $JPM, I could play $XLF instead to reap the rewards.

&nbsp;

**The third and final way to utilize collateral plays involves meme stocks**. This method is a little less consistent, so I use a tool like [Hungry Bot](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/) to aid me in this. Oftentimes, when one of the major meme tickers starts to run (GME, AMC, etc), other meme tickers follow suit. The issue with this is that the instant one of the major memes starts to run, MMs jack the fuck out of the option prices so us retail traders cant make any money. In order to circumvent this, we can look to make a collateral play on some of the *minor* meme stocks instead - My personal favourite for this is $BB. Last time when AMC started running, the IV on most contracts got jacked up so fast that it wasn't worth playing, however, the IV on BB stayed low for a while. Instead of playing AMC, I ended up playing BB. BB ended up following AMCs price action for a while on a percentage point basis, though you had a much greater window of opportunity to enter a position and reap the rewards. Not to mention, since BB had a lower starting IV to begin with, you actually would have ended up with *better returns playing BB than you would have if you were playing AMC*. Although BB was very profitable, you could’ve made this play with any other minor meme ticker so long as the IV was low upon entry, and they moved along with the other meme stocks. [**CLOV is another great example, which actually ended up being a 40 bagger**](https://i.imgur.com/Cq497yX.png) since we caught it well before it started running. Again, this method is a lot trickier to time and play manually, so I use [Hungry Bot](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/) to alert me whenever a play like this is possible. It often catches the meme tickers before they run and usually spits out the most profitable collateral play while doing so.

#Example Plays

Most of the explanations found in this post were directly taken from *real* trades that I’ve conducted, but I'll post them here again regardless.

&nbsp;

- Week one of earnings, I was extremely bullish on the financial sector as a whole. I ended up playing $XLF on April 12th and ended up catching nearly a 2% move in just two days. This may not seem like much, but on an ETF with an IV of 11%, I ended up getting a really solid return on my FDs.

&nbsp;

- Week two of earnings, I was bearish on solar as a whole due to the semiconductor shortage. Since Enphase was reporting alongside First Solar, I decided to play puts on Canadian Solar instead, since they are in the same sector but don’t report earnings until weeks after. Luckily for me my bet paid off, with Enphase tanking 15% and First solar closely behind with a 13% drop. My play, Canadian Solar, withered away 11% during that time, meaning I also secured a huge bag while walking away unscathed due to there being cheap options and no IV crush. If this play would have gone against me I would have had plenty of time to exit this play with minimal losses.

&nbsp;

- Lastly, I played BB while AMC was mooning. [**The 10C was priced at $0.3**](https://i.imgur.com/RAVgHwa.png). One week later, Blackberry touched 18$ and I I walked away with a clean 20 bagger. Not much to say here. I had a huge window of opportunity, and the writing was more or less on the wall after I watched AMC run nearly 20% on the day.

875,Seemingly nonsense buying power requirement (cash secured account) (iron condor VS CCS + CSP),"Credit iron condors require only enough buying power to cover the largest distance between the short and long strike less the credit received, because you can't be wrong in both directions. If the stock rallies too high, your bottom wing is still a ""winner"" technically. Same in reverse. So that makes sense.

Now, I have a call credit spread on AMC requiring $400 buying power. I figured I'd sell a cash secured put around the 4 strike without requiring any additional buying power since it's basically doing the same thing as an iron condor. Yet come to find out my broker (TD) wanted to lock up an additional $400. I can't wrap my head around why.

(I went ahead and turned it into a put credit spread by adding a 0.5 strike long leg for cheap. No additional buying power required, but strange that I needed to do this).",2021-06-25 05:37:51
876,Hedge funds rethink tactics after $12bn hit from meme stock army," [Hedge funds rethink tactics after $12bn hit from meme stock army – Investors News Blog](http://investorsnewsblog.com/2021/06/25/hedge-funds-rethink-tactics-after-12bn-hit-from-meme-stock-army/) 

 [admin](http://investorsnewsblog.com/author/admin/) 4 hours ago 

Hedge funds that bet on falling share prices are stepping up their efforts to spot the next GameStop after this year’s “meme stock” bonanza left the industry nursing billions of dollars of losses in just six months.

Huge gains in the price of companies favoured by day traders who assemble on message boards such as Reddit caught out some short sellers badly in late January. In recent weeks, these stocks have staged a second rally, with a rise in stocks including cinema chain AMC inflicting yet more pain.

Hedge fund losses since the start of the year from betting against just GameStop, AMC and Bed Bath & Beyond total more than $12bn, according to data group S3, while bets against a number of others have each run up additional losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. More than half short sellers’ $5.1bn of losses betting against AMC this year have come in June.

The heavy toll shows how moves by individual investors, which are regularly co-ordinated on forums such as r/WallStreetBets, has heightened the risks for professional investors in the Wall Street equities market.

“In two waves, a few hedge funds have seen modestly sized short positions turn into extinction-level events,” said Andrew Beer, managing member at investment firm Dynamic Beta Investments. Funds that suffer multiple rounds of losses on short bets “will face difficult questions from investors as to whether their risk management failed to adapt to a changed market environment”.

The highest-profile hedge fund casualty has been Melvin Capital, which lost 53 per cent in January and is still down 44.7 per cent this year to May. Light Street Capital, the fund led by ‘Tiger cub’ alumnus Glen Kacher, was also hit early this year and again in May, with losses in the first quarter predominantly driven by soured short bets. London-based White Square Capital, which lost money shorting GameStop, is also shutting its main fund.

An index compiled by Goldman Sachs of stocks favoured by retail investors has almost doubled since June 2020, while another that tracks companies that are targeted by short sellers has gained 28 per cent.

Traders across the industry, both those caught directly in abrupt rallies in heavily shorted stocks as well as those hit by the ensuing market volatility, have now been forced to start tracking potential retail investor maneuvers or risk huge losses and backlash from their investors. 

“The danger is you don’t really know what stock the retail community is going to go after next,” said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. “There is not a stock that is ‘safe’.”

Wu Silverman had typically concentrated on advising institutional clients about their hedging strategies. Now hedge funds seek her help to identify the early warning signs of a retail-driven meme stock surge.

“It has completely upended our markets, and we have had to make really dramatic changes to how we model things and how we manage risk,” she said. Retail investors chasing volatility “has gotten to the point where you can’t ignore it”.

Losses inflicted by retail investors have proved a rude awakening to hedge funds, which had just enjoyed a banner year in 2020 making their biggest gains since the aftermath of the financial crisis, according to HFR.

Some funds are considering taking a greater number of smaller short positions to cut down on the potential losses a single stock can cause, say industry insiders. D1 Capital, whose founder Daniel Sundheim previously worked at Viking, is one fund that has been considering reducing the size of short bets this year, say people familiar with the strategy. Others are looking at betting against indices, rather than individual stocks.

Managers in the US and UK have begun using algorithms to scour forums such as r/WallStreetBets or other data sources to try to spot co-ordinated buying. While the practice is new to most western funds, this kind of surveillance is already common for many Asian managers, according to Patrick Ghali, managing partner at advisory firm Sussex Partners.

Tiger cub Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital wrote to investors in April that its quant team “now systematically monitors Wall Street Bets and other similar forums that cater to less experienced, retail investors”. Moez Kassam, chief investment officer at Anson Funds in Toronto, said his firm has been building algorithms to follow commentary and sentiment on Reddit, as well as using some bought from external companies.

Fintech company S3 now provides a company’s “short squeeze risk” score to Bloomberg terminal users, while alternative research provider Quiver Quantitative scrapes Reddit investment threads for ticker mentions and sentiment.

“You don’t want your book to be exposed to the whims of r/WallStreetBets,” said Quiver founder James Kardatzke.

Data group Sentifi, which buys data from the likes of Reddit and Twitter and uses it to score sentiment around stocks, said it detected a nearly 1,200 per cent rise in chatter around AMC between May 20 and June 1. The cinema chain’s shares had already started to rise by then, but then doubled on June 2. Sentifi said the number of customers using its platform had doubled over the past year.

Swiss investment firm Unigestion has also started looking at how it can deploy its machine reading and data techniques — which it already uses to spot changing sentiment — around meme stocks.

“It is an important, though short-term, risk factor” in markets, said Unigestion portfolio manager Salman Baig. “For us, any factor that can disrupt markets is of primary concern.”

878,I invest based on quantitative sentiment score on Reddit - I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since inception. Last week's numbers and positions:,"Hey guys! Posted a little while ago about my project that invests based on sentiment analysis (I know you've seen sentiment trackers abound) and wanted to give an update and some new numbers. Long story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. **IMPORTANT:** Most of the below is a repost of stuff I've posted before (other than the new numbers), but I've added/trimmed down as I get better at explaining the right stuff.

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a **2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF**. Important to note that not every week is a breakout win (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and BUZZ by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since its introduction on March 4. This algorithm has returned 52%, compared to SPY's 10% and BUZZ's 7%.

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post.

&#x200B;

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. **Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term SPY-beating strategy.”** I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in BUZZ, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.

881,"Let's try a new ""market sentiment"" hot take, called Trade, Invest, Short","Hello, All,
I wanted to try something new. As a play on the ""forced social choice game"" of Kiss, Marry, Kill. The concept is to pick one stock you think would be fun for short term plays (Trade), one stock you have high conviction to be a long term holder in (Invest), and one stock that you are avoiding at all costs (Short). Below are my current picks.

Trade: SOFI - Currently in a Channel Up pattern. Opportunity for quant based Call option.
Invest: IIPR - Crazy growth and market share in ""Cannibus REITs"" with triple net leases. The increased legalization of marijuana presents a double edged sword of TAM vs competition. I'm currently betting on dominant position serving as a tailwind to outweigh new competition.
Short: AMC - As a former holder, I think the business has good long (LONG) term prospects, but that's after 1) a price correction back to the $4-$10 range and 2) their income stream/top line is back to 2019 levels to start paying down debt. My guess is they have positive returns starting in late 2023/early 2024.

*NOTE: I have no positions in any of the stocks. This is purely a thought experiment of quick elevator pitches.",2021-06-25 22:29:54

 “Short Attacks Explained”


What is a Short “Ladder” Attack:

Put simply, a short ladder attack is when both sides of the buying and selling of stocks are played (by traders) in an attempt to devalue the stock in question

Shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with fake shares.

Then, this launches into what is known as a short ladder attack. Think of it this way: 

Short A sells a false share at $20. 
Short B then buys this share. 

Following this,

Short B will then offer a counterfeit short at $19. 
Short A will go for that offer or short B will come down and hit short A’s $19 bid.

Short A then buys the share for $19, covering its open $20 short and taking a $1 profit.

This process repeats, putting the stock price into a downward spiral. Shorts can then begin to flood the market with an attack of false offers, overwhelming the demand on the buying side


[Anatomy of A Short attack ](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)

Published courtesy of Citizens for Securities Reform

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

Typical tactics include the following:

1. Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.
 
2. The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.
 
3. By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.
 
4. Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

An Example:

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

When you know better you do better so understand:

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. 

In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

1. Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.
 
The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the:

• Dow Jones News Agency

• The Wall Street Journal

• Barrons

• The New York Times

• Gannett Publication- USA Today

• Garnett Publication-The Arizona Republic

• CNBC (not a surprise)
 
2. The common thread:

 A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. 

This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

3. A Lesson in FUD 101:

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.
 
- Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.
 
This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. 

- Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.

4. Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

5. Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

6. Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.
 
The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

7. Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

8. Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.
Pulling margin from long customers -
The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. 

9. Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. 

[Click Here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=445&amp;amp;mn=25514&amp;amp;pt=msg&amp;amp;mid=1288319) 


Note: This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.
 
The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.
 
The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope

Bear Trading Tactics:

Short and Distort (all the same approaches):

Short and distort (S&amp;amp;D) refers to an unethical and illegal practice that involves shorting a stock and then spreading rumors in an attempt to drive down its price.

S&amp;amp;D traders manipulate stock prices conducting smear campaigns, often online, to drive down the price of the targeted stock.

A short-and-distorter's scheme can only succeed if the S&amp;amp;D trader has some degree of credibility.

A 'short and distort' is the inverse of the better known 'pump and dump' tactic.


Something to remember:

I like to think that these subs are tools to help me understand what happening. They also help calm my nerves and keep me calm and leveling my head, ultimately keeping me from getting taken advantage of… but i don’t know who can be trusted these days…

883,Value Investing Guide,"I wanted to create this post as there were many good questions posed in the TFSA thread I posted last night. I had intended to provide detailed answers to many of them but unfortunately the thread was deleted. 

# What is Value Investing?

Historically (i.e. going back to the founder of value investing, Benjamin Graham ) value investing has simply been defined as buying stocks at a discount. Basically buying a dollar for 50 cents. Over time this approach has become synonymous with a number of investing styles, e.g. Graham's net-nets or Buffett's cigar butts. And more recently people have associated value investing with investing solely in distressed negative growth companies (hence, the term value trap) or at the opposite end of the spectrum only investing in blue chips (i.e. companies with the most value). 

When I think of value investing I prefer to keep things intuitive and true to its original simplified meaning, i.e. value investing is simply buying a company at a discount. 

&#x200B;

# Determining Value

If value investing is buying a company at a discount (or on sale) then in order to make an informed decision its true value needs to be discovered. A company's true value can be arrived at in a number of ways;

1) Intrinsic value - Using a financial model such as a discounted cash flow analysis. This involves a number of assumptions, most notably its exit multiple. Is a company's value 5x its discounted cash flow or 10x? The multiple used is generally in line with its peers. 

2) Liquidation Value - What is the company's value if it is dismantled and sold off today? In this case tangible assets and debt obligations are more important than cash flow.

3) Market Value - What if its true value is actually its market value? In a rational or at least consistent market  a company's  value could be determined through the interaction of buyers and sellers. But what happens when something disrupts the market, the process of price discovery? Could it be assumed that once this force dissipates there will be a reversion to the mean?

There is no consensus on what variables should be used in determining a company's true value or even what the proper framework is. Each framework has its drawbacks. For example, what use is liquidation value if the company has a majority shareholder that is unwilling to sell. Or what if the. process takes years - what will the liquidation value be 5 years from now? My personal approach when looking for value is to find companies with as much of a margin of safety as possible. If multiple things need to go right for its true value to be realized then I am probably not interested.

&#x200B;

# Buying at a Discount

Once one has determined a company's true value then it is a simple matter of getting a stock quote and seeing if the company is trading at a discount to the determined value. How much of a discount is required is dependent on the risks involved in the company achieving its true value. Usually the more risks, the greater the discount, but not always. What leads a stock to trade at a discount?

**1) No Market**

The interaction of buyers and sellers determines the market. If either or both of these sides are shallow then price can fluctuate wildly. For example, a stock with low volume but with highly concentrated ownership can take a severe beating if one of these shareholders needs to exit the stock. Recognizing this pattern can be as simple as looking at the house positions when volume spikes. Checking SEDAR for alternative monthly reports and SEDI for insider filings is also useful.  There are many reasons why a large shareholder may want to exit its position, most of them have nothing to do with the company's fundamentals.

There could also be no market due to low level of interest in the company. Without volume buyers a company can easily trade at a discount to its peers. This has been historically true of the Canadian market in general, especially tech, relative to the US market. A company should not trade at a lower multiple just because it lacks interest from institutions and funds.

Of course there are associated risks with the above. Most likely a smaller company that isn't followed has a much smaller moat and is more vulnerable to competition. It may seem like a deal today but what about in 5 years? I have also seen stocks permanently damaged when large sellers exit a position; there is no bounce back or reversion to the mean. In this case I like to have some extra safety such as a pristine balance sheet, something that will ensure there will be no permanent loss of capital.

**2) The Company is Misunderstood**

Analysts, fund. managers, the average person, they all have flaws. There is no reason that they can't be outsmarted. Of course this is all predicated on the idea that eventually they will come around and drive up the share price closer to its true value. There is no substitute for good research. And this is more than researching a company's fundamentals; it's also researching market trends, trends in sentiment. Office REITs have been booming lately not because fundamentals have changed (they never really changed at all during COVID) but because sentiment has changed. Reading human sentiment, researching historical patterns, a psychological and possibly epidemiological analysis was maybe more important than fundamental analysis in this instance. The risk of course is that you are wrong and everyone else was right.

The above can be summarized simply as *I have specialized knowledge*. I am aware something exists that others don't and I am more knowedgable than others concerning this company's prospects. There are value investors that go to great lengths searching for dark companies, that is companies that no longer file financials. Instead you have to mail them and request copies. They go to great lengths to achieve this specialized knowledge. I don't believe this is necessary as for all intents and purposes many tiny companies trading in Canada are completely off the radar, and might as well be dark. This is  where risk assessment is critical. If management is not shareholder friendly how much of a discount do I need to compensate for this risk? 

# The (Re)Search

I generally avoid screeners when looking for value stocks as most are filled with inaccuracies. The biggest problem, however is treating all assets as being equal. Mining stocks will capitalize their exploration inflating the book value. These assets are not worth nearly as much as capitalized assets of an industrial manufacturer. I prefer to just pop open a company's SEDAR filing when financials are released. It literally takes 10 seconds to determine if there is any potential value disconnect. 

The only screener I regularly use is the 52 week low screener. If a stock is dropping and out of favour I am interested. I found amusing all the comments in the TFSA thread that I must have YOLO'ed GME or AMC because my approach is actually the exact inverse. A couple people question why I owned Mindbeacon (""that's trash""). I love stocks with negative sentiment because that suggests to me there may be a disconnect between its market value and its true value. A few recent IPOs have been floundering so bad due to IPO fatigue that they are trading near 50% of their cash value despite being debt free, cash flow neutral, and growing. 

Once a company piques my interest through either a quick glance at their financials or after popping up on my radar due to a sell off I will delve in deeper. Researching the company further, assessing risks, reading analyst reports, researching their peers, understanding their sector's historical valuations, etc. The goal is simply to understand why does there exist a value disconnect and is it deserved.

# Buying the Stock

Once I have determined the company's true value, and determined the price I am willing to pay after analyzing the risks  I will make an initial purchase with the intention of scaling in. I will also set a target price based on my current understanding of fundamentals. If the stock pops immediately after I buy it I sell. If the stock continues to languish or drop I will continue to build my position so long as the fundamentals haven't changed. I will only buy on the way up if fundamentals have changed for the better.

Once my target price is hit I sell. I don't care if the sentiment has changed and the market is going euphoric for a little stock I discovered when no one cared. I don't own a stock to play sentiment; I own it to play value. If it hits what I determine to be fair value, I sell. If fundamentals change for the worse and I determine the stock is now trading at fair value, I sell and take a loss.

# Growing a Portfolio through Value Investing

This can be frustrating. Especially starting at 0 as it doesn't allow one to properly scale into positions, have some diversification, and most importantly, just be patient. I try to keep at least 10% of my portfolio in cash so that when an opportunity arises I can pounce. The problem with some of these value stocks is that they may take literally years for their true value to be realized. During that time they appear as dead money. This isn't so much a problem with a large portfolio but for a smaller portfolio it could tie up one's money inhibiting growth. This just means one needs to be more selective with a smaller portfolio; don't be afraid to sell one holding in favour of a new opportunity if the new opportunity is better; and look for value stocks with near term catalysts. Much of my early TFSA growth came from buying stocks that were divvying out either their cash through a special dividend leaving a stub, or divvying out a non-core subsidiary. In these situations the market tends to just value the cash or the core subsidiary giving no value to the stub or non-core subsidiary.  This can be an easy 10-20% gain but it could also lead to exponential returns if the stub or non-core entity amount to something. Luck will always be involved as will losses. Nothing is guaranteed but I truly believe a disciplined, well researched approach to value investing gives one an edge in the long run.",2021-06-27 18:05:38

For instance, if I trade the same ticker over and over again, and have a 70% win rate on those trades BUT I have one big bad losing trade that counters all of the wins, it will appear as a 0% win rate.

Again, reminder that the overall data is going to take quite some time to balance out as the first several weeks served as a testing period where I would do a lot of 1 share and very low leverage trades in an attempt to practice my strategy and the usage of the software. I would focus more on my weekly statistics to gauge my progress so far. I imagine by the end of this year, my overall statistics should be balanced.

I decided to take one more short position and it was in profit for a little, then it started moving against me and I kept moving my stop because we were just below VWAP and the assumption was all the volume was used on the selling side today, there won't be enough juice to break this back up. 

I was so, terribly wrong. 

Which is extra depressing because I have been calling this catalyst out for months now and not only did I not get to play into it, I played against it and payed the price. It did indeed break VWAP, in fact, it exploded through it and I ended up taking a $4,612.60 loss on that one trade. 

I started chipping away at it as quickly as I could but for some reason I couldn't switch from bear to bull mentally. At any rate, I got it down to around (2,400). I decided to take up one more big trade to try to get myself to a break even on the week and I lost another $1000 or so. 

I decided it was time to walk away and I did, especially since I was headed home to PA to visit for the weekend. I couldn't shake what happened and did something really stupid that ended up paying off...I started trading from my phone on the road. No need to lecture me, I know how incredibly dangerous and stupid this is but I certainly was not in the right state of mind and I did it anyways. 

I was able to make back around $700 this way getting my final P/L and losing $215 on the week. 

Not the worst outcome for a very important lesson, but still I could have had another incredible week and would be up around $14,000 on the month. For those who don't know, yes, I am beginning Week 13 of this journey, but I haven't really been using much leverage until June so most of my earnings are because I actually started trading this month instead of just training.

# Psychology

Well, I had to revisit [Zalesky's 25 point mantra](http://www.r-5.org/files/books/trading/schoolbooks/Douglas_E_Zalesky-The_25-point_Mantra-EN.pdf) and remind myself of several, very important rules:

\#4 Never turn a winner into a loser

\#5 Your biggest loser can't exceed your biggest winner

\#10 Get out of your losers

\#12 Don't hope and pray, if you do, you will lose

\#17 Never take big losses, only a big loss can hurt you

\#19 Hit singles, not homeruns

What otherwise could have been a fantastic week went to shit on one trade. Not one day, not one week, one trade. This definitely hurt, not only because of the pain of losing, but what's worse is this was the catalyst I have been going on about that would send this thing to the next level. 

I also noticed a huge problem with rule #12. When you do find yourself hoping and praying, it fills you with hopium that the trade will come back for you. This is bad for obvious reasons, but the less obvious reason is what I experienced and have learned from.

When you are filled with the hopium, it becomes exceedingly more difficult to switch roles. 

If you convince yourself that the trade will come back for you, it makes you blind to the fact that it is clearly moving the other way and if you just switch hats, then you can make back your loss and profit. 

By the time I decided to go long and not just scalp the run was virtually over. If I was able to recognize sooner that the trade was not coming back for me, not only would I have taken a smaller loss, but I would have had massive gains by reversing. This is something I intend on working on quite diligently. 

# Software

I'm still absolutely loving TradesViz as my journaling software. I love this software and the company is fantastic. I am a big fan of monitoring my progress weekly and monthly and offered a suggestion and this is the second suggestion they have taken from me! They really do want to be the go to for journaling software and their customer service shows that through and through. So the new feature they added was a weekly tracking of P/L. On their main Daily Statistics page, if you filter by the week its not going to capture swing trades or anything opened before the date range you select, it will only show what is closed. So now in the calendar view it shows your weekly/monthly results. I will add another image here for you to see:

I'm still using TradeStation and the more I play with it the more I fall in love. I haven't tried many different pieces of software in terms of daytrading but with the ones I have tried this is without a doubt my favorite.

**TL;DR:** Time to bring back some of my discipline, this very giving market has made me take on a lot of unnecessary risk. I was getting away with it for a while but I now have paid the price and do not intend on paying the price again.",2021-06-28 15:21:38

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY and QQQ neutral, inside of yesterday's range pre-market. Yesterday Tech was the leading sector, Solar was the leading industry. Solar was the leading Industry along with Semiconductors. We also saw more money continue to flow into Auto Manufacturers. We continue to see big moves in small caps which is usually the case during summertime. Still not many earnings being reported and it will remain this way until mid July when Alcoa reports. SPY is up 3 days in a row for only the 2nd time since mid April, this is something to keep in mind since we have got a sell off every time we've reached 3 green days in the recent past. Not sure if the market will sell off today, it's just something to be aware of. I will be focused on high volume stocks, preferably in sectors that have been showing strength. Good luck trading.

892,UPDATE: I invest based on quantitative sentiment score on Reddit - I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since inception (but lost this past week). Last week's numbers and positions (and what I'm rebalancing into tomorrow morning),"Hey guys! Been posting the last few week about my project that invests based on sentiment analysis (I know you've seen sentiment trackers abound) and wanted to give an update and some new numbers. Long story short for the week -- ehhh. **IMPORTANT: Most of the below is a repost of stuff I've posted before, but there are new numbers and analyses that I do every week. Additionally, I've added/trimmed down as I get better at explaining the right stuff.**

&#x200B;

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below, giving me a -1.26% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.61% return for SPY and 1.44% for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF. I've thus far posted my wins, but this isn't some panacea -- there are often loss weeks and I want to highlight that as well. Still, a $100k portfolio invested at BUZZ's inception March 4 would be: $155k for this portfolio, $114k for SPY, and $114k for BUZZ.

**Here's the** [**source code**](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)**!** Note: this does need to be edited according to your needs (how many of the top you want to invest in, how you want to deploy it, etc.)

&#x200B;

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. **Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO, sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term strategy.”** I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC.

So, here’s the stuff you’ve been waiting for. The data from this week:

**WallStreetBets - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what’s in my portfolio)**

Estimated Total Comments Parsed Last 7 Day(s): 300k-ish (I don't store all parsed comments, just the ones I need). This week, I cleaned up my data intake and purifying mechanism (I was picking up SI before, and don't think that was warranted) so the numbers are smaller than last week. I haven't done a full backtest using this new mechanism just yet, which I'm planning on doing tonight.

&#x200B;

|**Ticker**|**Comments/Posts**|**Sentiment Score**\*|

893,I'm another lucky meme trader that got burned and is now trying to develop more sustainable habits.,"Hi all,

I'm hoping I can explain where I'm at and get input about where I should go from here as I'm just feeling a bit lost.

I'm a very new trader, less than two months. I started by catching a surprise ""huge"" win on AMC  (not a ton but it sure caught my attention) where I had  $5 in and as it exploded, I added more. Then I had a second stroke of luck with CLOV, and another with SPCE. After that...well...let's just say I'm content to stop trading memes stocks for the time being and am looking to put more emphasis on risk management and time management as I can check in regularly since I work remotely most days but I can't just stare at the tickers all day like I have been. 

Currently, my account is down about 2% from my starting place. 

Today I had the same unfortunate experience a couple of times. I'd make a trade, it'd go into profit by a bit and I'd try to hold until it was twice what my risk was but ultimately these drifted down and down into the negatives until I eventually just got stopped out. Should I be adjusting my stop loss as things cross the profit line to make sure I lose as few trades as possible or holding for that double risk point?

I am curious how you go about managing small fluctuations on stocks for more established companies that don't explode and implode quite so much. I bought into a handful of established companies today that I believe due to my professional experience in tech, that the world would have to turn upside down for these companies to do anything other than tighten their grip on the market. 

Namely APPL, AMD and MSFT. AMD looks like it's at something of support but APPL is pushing an old resistance but MSFT is basically at an ATH. That said I know about the work Microsoft is doing I don't think a slump is around the corner for them. 

I also bought on Ford (F) since I identified it to be at a support point and GE as I was wagering that it is also at a support level.

And finally, I bought on COIN. I maybe FOMOd a little bit but I've used coinbase and their comissions are kind of brutal, with the renewed interest in crypto, and the lack of PDT rules, I'm feeling like that company is going to be in for some large profits. That said with today's rally, I'm nervous about a morning sell-off tomorrow. 

By the end of the day I was going and watching the 10 minute chart and selling when a candlestick would close below the one before it if it was a substantial drop and just wait it out very small moves. 

I'd like to try going long on some positions like AMD, APPL, and MSFT without having to micromanage quite so much but also don't want blow my account. Right now my position sizes are about equal and I'd have to lose about 8-10% of my investment to constitute losing 1% of my total account. 

Namely APPL, AMD, and MSFT. AMD looks like it's at something of support but APPL is pushing an old resistance but MSFT is basically at an ATH. That said I know about the work Microsoft is doing I don't think a slump is around the corner for them. t to constitute losing 1% of my total account. 'm nervous about a morning sell-off tomorrow.

[http://regsho.finra.org/FORFshvol20210629.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/FORFshvol20210629.txt)

This is part of a short term trend, the stock has been 60% short over the past 5 trading sessions.

However, this isn’t a new trend.  The shorts have been trying to hold AGYP back for the past few months.  

Why are the shorts increasing their positions now?  

They are probably getting a little scared.  

The stock is up 100% in the past month, and the company’s news is trending in the right direction.

A recent string of twitter updates show Allied Energy is making serious progress at their Green and Gilmer leases located in Texas.  [https://twitter.com/AlliedEnergyCo1](https://twitter.com/AlliedEnergyCo1)

The shorts know there could be big news on the heels of all this work, and they are trying to kill momentum before the stock gets away from them.  If AMC and GME showed us anything, it is the way short sellers work.  

The price of oil continues to climb, and AGYP is closer to producing barrels of the black gold.  The stock is coming up on 2 major resistance points at 51 cents and 66 cents.

 Monitor this situation, as there may be opportunity for traders and investors alike in AGYP.   ",2021-06-30 12:18:04
896,Is AMC the new Tesla stock of 2021? - Rising Candle post,,2021-06-30 19:25:08
897,What the most popular Meme stocks GME and AMC have in common that many others don’t.,"$GME was valued at $4 in Aug 2020 at MktCap $300M with ‘pre covid’ revenue of $6Bn giving a valuation of 0.05 PS ratio.

$AMC was valued at $2 in Dec 2020 at MktCap $1Bn with ‘pre covid’ revenue of $5Bn giving a valuation of 0.2 PS ratio. 

Based on PS alone they were both severely undervalued (especially $GME) given both are in industries that are not going away…gaming and movies.

The challenge now is that many of the latest Meme stocks are not severely undervalued and therefore may struggle to find outsized gains over regular stock price moves. They will likely disappoint in the short term anyhow.

If Meme is fundamentally about boosting undervalued stocks rather than hype alone, then perhaps the next one may be $JOAN at 0.2 PS ratio rather than $WISH.

899,Long range Put options for AMC or Meme Stocks,"Trade idea:

Whether the third squeeze happens or not, AMC's pricing cannot be sustained in the $50-$60 range. If it squeezes the pricing will crater shortly. If it doesn't squeeze, Reddittors will lose interest and the pricing will come down as demand craters.

Risks:

**AMC follows a TSLA like model where the pricing never falls down** to natural fundamental driven levels. What if AMC keeps getting reloaded by shorters with the same investment thesis that AMC is bound to fall. As SI climbs back up, Reddit notices and it drives back up demand on this proven squeeze stock with a large community. However, AMC has no explosive growth potential since the theater business has a near realized saturation. AMC has no gigafactory or fancy roof solar panels that is beyond their core business.

AMC Squeeze Saga continues on for another six months. There is a real risk that this keeps going on for another six months where pricing never falls back down because both sides won't blink.

Conclusion:

It seems whether the third AMC squeeze happens or not, within six months (Dec or Jan strike) the pricing levels seems like it should fall. Maybe to at least the $25-35 range.

900,A different kind of post - Classic narrative,"Lately a new narrative has taken over the interwebz.

I then look at Ride, NKLA, QS. NKLA in my opinion being the trash of trash and a great example of how a bull market can keep anything afloat Lol

Then I go to Pltr, Peloton, Bmbl, Door Dash, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Snowflake.

Then I go to Nakd, and Fold.

Then I check out some classics like Pfizer, AT&T, Coca-Cola. I weirdly like to look at Moderna.

Then I check out Endeavour Group Holdings, Coinbase, Thredup, Walkme.

Then I check out Canopy.

Then BB, AMC, GME.

Then SLV, GLD.

Then Trillium, CRISPR.

Then onto the coins.

Then RKT and SPCE.

It is a weird routine I have each and every day almost.

I think it provides a good exposure to a various class of equities sometimes by groups, sometimes by weird segments of the investing sphere.

I think everything is insanely priced and way to high hah but we are in the everything bubble so that is what it is.

All in all the classic narrative is that it provides me a good understanding of what is happening in the various big blocks of the investing world. Also through google finance I get some good recommends on companies that I don't know about that maybe I will like based on that list and then I expand it sometimes.

902,Need opinions on my new investing strategy,"I’m 24 years old and started investing into stocks last year during the Covid 19 shut downs. Currently my net portfolio is worth $3,345.90 with my total gain being $1,447.59 (77%). Currently my whole portfolio is 

AMC (AMC theaters)
CAKE (cheesecake factory)
DIS (Disney)
KO(Coca Cola)
MGM (MGM Resorts)
TSLA (Tesla)
VNQ (Vanguard REIT)

I recently found out about dividend investing and dividend kings and aristocrats. The stocks in my portfolio that I have that pay dividends are MGM, KO, and VNQ.

VNQ with a 3.13% dividend yield 
MGM with a 0.02% dividend yield 
KO with a 3.10% dividend yield 

I’ve decided to change up my strategy for investing and mainly invest in dividend stocks. 

My plan right now is to buy 2 KO shares a month with one VNQ share a month as well for the rest of this year regardless if the stock is green or red or wether im losing money or not, with DRIP enabled. 

I want to make this account solely for dividends. KO and VNQ are just 2 stocks im investing in that I want to stock up on currently. KO because I personally love Coca Cola and VNQ because it is a REIT. I want to make passive income with my investments and I plan to never sell my dividend stocks. I want to be able to make $10 in dividend by next year. 

Do you guys think that this is a good investment strategy to solely make an account with only dividend stocks? 

(Side note: I have another investment account from work that I have $100k in and I always get $10k worth of stocks a year  through employee contributions. I plan on buying a house with this work account. The stock is TSLA)

Also if you guys can recommend any other good dividend stocks I’d highly appreciate it! I am looking at VOO as well and plan on investing in it and buying a share every end of the Month)

Quite possibly the single most   undervalued energy stock on the market. This baby is going to explode   very soon, if not imminently, especially after today's jump. I'm talking   20+ easy if it even gets slight momentum. The stock really has no   limits. Big wigs want to keep this stock cheap so they can add to   portfolio. Every share of this stock is like printing future money.   Don't believe me? I'll run through the numbers in a bit. I'm here to end   that and bring attention to a company that has done an outstanding job   of weathering a bad market (covid), natural disasters and a complete   management overhaul. This is genuinely a good company that makes great   products and is now leading the way in reusable energy tech. The new   management team is aces with Steve Mawer, rock star CEO from Koch   industries.

When I say cutting   edge I mean it. I'm talking renewable diesel. Alongside reusable   feedstock, hydrogen and asphalt. CLMT has kept this very quiet while   working on R&D and has hardly gone public with this news. Once the   press releases get out, it will be too late.

[https://montana-renewables.com/](https://montana-renewables.com/) for complete details on their reusable energy transition.

[https://www.calumetspecialty.com/](https://www.calumetspecialty.com/) (main website)

Once   the company goes public with their investment into reusable energy   alongside its already extremely valuable specialty products line (WD-40,   truefuels, royal purple, chapstick, belray, amongst almost 3000 other   specialty products and oil refineries), this thing is going to take  off.  The undervaluing that has been going on with this stock is  straight  silly. I mean, this stock was a dollar last year! That didn't  last long  and neither will its current price of just above $7.00. Some  chart  analysis shows a big technical breakout at $6.40 and no  resistance from  there. New high in terms of volume today....someone is  watching. The  floor that this stock is going to retain despite any kind  of spike  should make anyone excited. CLMT owns and operates 10 large   oil/production plants across the U.S., its assets alone in a normal   market make its valuation pure nonsense. It's worth way more and whales   know it.

Let's get into some   numbers that I promised earlier... 3.5 billion in revenue per year. 150M   in free cash flow. The 10 plants the company owns gives it an   enterprise value of 2 billion which is quite frankly not even realistic.   To build those 10 plants today would cost easy over 7 billion.  CLMT   could do 400M in EBITDA next year, its valued at 600M.  AMC might do   400M EBITDA and its valued at 30 billion. See the difference? The   undervaluing is just stupid and because of this the floor for this stock   is undeniable. CLMT might be one of the most undervalued stocks on the   market, especially when you consider the impressive assets the company   retains. Do they carry some debt from the prior management team? Yes.   But its being paid down at a blistering pace of about 250M per year.  The  companies net worth far exceeds any debt accumulation.

Oh   and did I mention dividend reinstatement for longs? I'm telling you   right now, get in. If apes want to champion legitimate renewable energy   strategies and not waste resources with companies that don't follow   through, then this stock could quite literally 10x itself. They are an   impressive company with very little fanfare. Stocktwits just starting to   see volume on followers. This will change soon. Get in now, make   yourself some serious cash. If apes want a sure thing, here it is.

I will be happy to answer any questions from here.",2021-07-01 21:15:47
904,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 2, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 2, 2021**

Stocks rose once again, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. 

Today, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

President Biden said of the report, “This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.”

Emily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, “This is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining – I wouldn't call them necessarily contained – but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold – this is just what the market wants.""

This Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a “string” of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), it’s changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.

**Highlights**

* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.
* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. 
* Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data**,** but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.
* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.""
* Jeff Bezos is officially stepping down as Amazon CEO on Monday. Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassey will be taking over for him.

906,"Expected moves this week, SPY, SPCE, WKHS and more","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished the week above its bullish expected move, up 1.5% vs the 0.8% options were pricing. The SPY has moved more than its expected move and established new highs over the past few weeks, while its implied volatility (and expected move) has compressed as moves have mostly been in one direction to the upside.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **0.7%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. That corresponds to about **$429** as a *bearish consensus* and **$437** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was lower into the holiday weekend, closing at around 15. That’s the lowest levels of market implied volatility since pre-pandemic. In January 2020, before the Covid sell-off, the VIX was as low as 12. Its historical mean is near 19 but that incorporates long periods of time of low volatility (and the VIX in the low teens) with occasional bouts of extreme volatility and spikes in the VIX.

Looking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22. In other words, near-term options are compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.

Those looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.

Expected Moves for This Week (via **Options AI**):

* SPY **0.7%** (was 0.8% last week)

&#x200B;

### In the News

As markets made new highs meme stocks were once again some of the most actively traded names, yet their implied volatilities (and expected moves) have tended to compress from a few weeks ago. Here are the expected moves for this week in some of the trending tickers, and their change vs their expected moves from last week (mostly less, albeit with a 4 trading day week):

* Gamestop **GME 8%** (was 13% last week)
* AMC Theaters **AMC 13%** (was 15% last week)
* Virgin Galactic **SPCE 13%** (was 19% last week)
* Contextlogic **WISH 11%** (was 16% last week)
* Clover Health **CLOV 11%** (was 13% last week)
* Workhorse **WKHS 11%** (was 10% last week)

Let me know what I missed or if you have any questions about options in a low vol environment. The TL:DR version is that options have a hard time pricing a steady move higher, but that could create some opportunities for those looking to scoop options on the cheap side, particularly hedges. It also means that individual stock volatility can sometimes overshoot to the cheap side, especially if it has some idiosyncratic event coming up (like earnings). On the short premium side, if the trades are near term, it's basically a battle between low implied vol and realized vol (actual moves). IOW, it's all about expected moves.",2021-07-05 13:46:50
907,Left My Career to Learn to Become a Full Time Day Trader - Week 13 Update,"Hello all!

Well...you're going to want to strap in for this week, things didn't go so well and it looks like they will be getting worse before they get better.

# Key Statistics (Overall)

NOTE: I am using TradesViz which is so fantastic HOWEVER, the win rates are calculated based on trades and not executions. For instance, if I trade the same ticker over and over again, and have a 70% win rate on those trades BUT I have one big bad losing trade that counters all of the wins, it will appear as a 0% win rate.

Again, reminder that the overall data is going to take quite some time to balance out as the first several weeks served as a testing period where I would do a lot of 1 share and very low leverage trades in an attempt to practice my strategy and the usage of the software. I would focus more on my weekly statistics to gauge my progress so far. I imagine by the end of this year, my overall statistics should be balanced.

Account Net Worth: $60,838.03

Unrealized P/L: ($1,406)

Realized P/L: $16,270.24

Average P/L Per Week: $2,324.32 (Note: This is based on when I started using real leverage around Week 6)

Average P/L Per Day: $285.82

# Week 13

Well...This was...not excellent. I took some pretty significant losses this week and didn't take significant profits when I had the opportunity. I am a man filled with regret this week. The sad part is...my day trades were actually really, really good. It was my swing trades and cashing out of losing positions that really hurt. Here's the kicker...one of the parts was literally...a fat finger.

If you are more interested in the day trades feel free to click the hyperlinks on each day and see what trades I took. Pretty awesome returns, but I wasn't using a whole lot of leverage since all of my money was tied up elsewhere.

Basically, day trading was great this week, things started turning south on Wednesday. When I literally fat fingered a massive mistake and closed my SPCE position for a loss which I absolutely did not want to do.

Then Thursday, after taking an unnecessary loss I realized it was probably time to take necessary losses, so I closed out my meme spec plays as the catalysts and TA I was watching became invalidated. 

Friday arrives and SPCE is mooning pre-market. I decided not sell the $10,000 I had in gains but instead I decided to average down on calls expiring next week. 

I'll provide more detail on each day.

P/L: ($2,264.13)

Win Rate: 65%

[Monday 06/28](https://www.tradesviz.com/viewday/uLDmHrRQ)

P/L: $876.67

Win Rate: 83.33%

I had a good day trading SPCE (if you haven't noticed it's one of my favorite stocks to trade). Most of the P/L came from this but I had successful trades on a few other tickers, but again, I wasn't using enough leverage even though the percent returns were fantastic. It was very sad to see that trend all week. I was having 6-9% trades but I was using barely any money, and I mean some of these trades I was using as little as $500. I won't talk about that again, just as you look through the trades understand it would have been an absolutely enormous week if I trusted myself on stocks other than my swing trade stocks.

[Tuesday 06/29](https://www.tradesviz.com/viewday/QxkPr0nF)

P/L: $484.65

Win Rate: 85.71%

Another great day trading. Awesome percent returns but again same issue I mentioned above.

[Wednesday 06/30](https://www.tradesviz.com/viewday/Oeh7zz6I)

P/L: ($2,784.85)

Win Rate: 70%

This was the day of the fat finger. Again, I was having a fantastic day trading away and for the first time I decided to trade multiple stocks at the same time, turns out, I'm definitely not ready for that. Although I was successful in doing so, I made a huge mistake by clicking close on SPCE when I meant to close out of a scalp. So yes, I took a $3000 loss on a stock that I wanted to hold and yes, the very next day it ran up 25% and I would have made a great sum of money without ever realizing any losses. Very unfortunate, but I suppose lessons were learned.

[Thursday 07/01](https://www.tradesviz.com/viewday/u6tRoZXX)

P/L: ($2,334.13)

Win Rate: 35.71%

After accidentally taking a loss on SPCE I decided it was time to clean up shop a little bit. If I was going to realize losses on stocks I didn't even want to, then I should probably realize losses on stocks that I should close out of. I closed out of virtually all of my losing positions that I was holding as the catalysts and TA have become invalidated. The good news is, these updates don't quite reflect everything that is happening since I have things going for weeks at a time but only report on weekly events. What I mean by that is I have been selling AMC CC's for the past several weeks, so all the loses I realized on the stock were covered. 

Today was not a great day for trading all together for me. Even if I didn't close out of those positions, I would have had a red day.

[Friday 07/02](https://www.tradesviz.com/viewday/n3GPF1Cn)

Win Rate: 100% 

P/L: $70

My, my, my....this was just...depressing. Well, I decided to load up on SPCE shares and calls just before close just in case they decided to announce the test flight after hours. Well, that's precisely what happened and I woke up to being incredibly ITM. I was up over 20% on my shares and 300% on my calls, roughly showing $10,000 P/L. But as you can tell from my P/L I have above...I did not cash out.

Why? Well, I have been following this stock for a year now and everything has been leading to this moment, the moment where Richard Branson goes to space himself. That moment is next weekend.

So, when the market opened, I anticipated a sell the news event but what happened I did not see coming. My absolute biggest mistake was not selling my calls right at open, that should have been done, no brainer. I was just so sure that it was just a pullback and we were going to seek more upside on this two decade long news that has finally arrived...I was terribly mistaken.

The stock plummeted, giving back all of the gains it received from the news, and putting me in the red after being up $10,000. I said if it fell under $50 I would have to consider selling and re-entering. But every single bounce that came, I swore it had to be the bottom, after all, SPCE reached $60 on a random test flight announcement earlier this year and that didn't even have Branson nor did they have FAA approval. My PT was $70.

A hard lesson was learned here, I have yet to be in this position. Normally, I had either sold way to early and I'm bitching about how I need to hold on longer and really juice my wins. But I have yet to go this positive and then just give it all back.

So, next week is going to be extremely interesting for me. If you noticed, my calls are now severely punished and will likely be worse next week. So I did something I typically avoid, I kept adding to a losing position. I refuse to believe that after this news, it would just give back all of it's gains, it actually looks like SPCE conducted an offering and that was a majority of the selling pressure. That being said, I kept averaging down my calls every chance I could get. Especially once it found the floor. 

We will see next week, I will hopefully at least be able to get my money back as I expect an extremely volatile and bullish week for SPCE, but it would be sad to have picked the right stock at the right time and played it wrong to just walk away with nothing. 

# Psychology

The biggest thing for me this week was outside factors. I am an entrepreneur and the stock market is meant to be the vehicle for me to raise capital for the businesses I am building out. One of these businesses is getting very close to being ready to go and I need a large sum of capital to pull it off. I was a pig on Friday. $10,000 is literally 1/6 of my account size, to look that in the face and say ""nah"" is something that I can't believe I did. 

I started breaking a rule that I actually don't typically break ""Hit singles, not homeruns"". Normally, when I trade it's literally all singles, hell, they are bunts. I take profits so fast it's ubsurd and almost always miss out on a significant amount of upside.

I think I saw this as my ""opportunity"" where I was going to make so much money it would be life changing and I let that blind me to the point where I completely went against my entire strategy and everything that has helped me maintain success up to this point. 

I certainly have learned this lesson the hard way. I would like to say it's over now, but I have already doubled down on all my positions, so next week is going to be a week of pain or rejoice. If it doesn't go my way I will likely be reporting my 3rd week of losses and the sad part is, all of the day trading in between is perfectly fine. I just keep giving back all of my gains via massive swing trades that I am managing poorly, and by managing poorly I literally just mean I'm not realizing gains when I should be.

I'm still using TradeStation and I don't have many complaints because I can't tell if it's just operator error. I need to take some time and just do a software day and get really familiar and comfortable with my setup. I really can't have any fat finger days that lose me money on accident. That is so incredibly noobish and I hope you will never see me report anything like that ever again.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Lol. That's literally all I can do at this week. Fat finger for a $3k loss + not cashing out a $10k gain and watching it fall into the red, meanwhile doubling down on the way down. Next week is either going to be glorious or brutal, I'm sure you will all enjoy next weeks post either way.",2021-07-05 19:09:40

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY gapping up/neutral Pre-market, QQQ gapping up and continuing to run. 125 stocks moved higher over 5% yesterday vs 437 that sold off more than -5%. This tells me that although the market looks strong, action in individual stocks was bearish. Since the FAANG stocks are so heavily weighted, they can cause the market to move higher even when the majority of stocks are selling off. AMZN made a huge move yesterday compared to it's average day and the rest of big tech also moved higher which were responsible for the performance Tech had while the other sectors were selling off. We are still seeing money flow into Solar and Software and Gold.

Not many great gappers this morning at the time of writing this. Only 5 stocks with an average volume over 500k will report earnings this week. Next week Alcoa will kick off earnings and trading may pick up a bit but keep in mind that it's summer so things can remain slow for a while longer. Action remains strong in select small caps and there is still decent action in individual stocks as well. If nothing great sets up pre market, I'll run a scan after the market opens to find volume. If nothing looks great, I just won't trade. Good luck out there!

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Woke up and ran my scan before looking at the major indices. By 7:00 AM est I already had 300 gaps on my main scan, the majority of which are gap downs. Apparently there are fears about the Rona resurfacing due to new variants, Japan declaring a state of emergency ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. Truth is, the market could use a pullback. Big tech is very extended, just look at AAPL ,AMZN, ORCL charts. I've said this before and I'll say it again pull backs are healthy for the market. Pull Backs are healthy but big gap days in either direction are usually tricky to trade.

I had talked recently about FAANG stocks moving higher while individual stocks have been selling off. Today we have plenty of gap downs but most gap down charts have been selling off for days already and are getting extended. We may see a bounce in many gap downs at the open. This doesn't always happen but the majority of time it will. I will be focusing on stocks with charts that are not very extended already; stocks that have room on the daily charts to fall and move freely. If the market declines, I will be looking to UVXY for setups. If you are nervous or don't feel comfortable, just sit this one out and observe, no sweat. If you want to try your hand on what could be a tough day, then manage your risk accordingly and you should be fine. Good Luck Trading!

Also Stock went up today 15% and puts did not go much down. 

Let's see what next week brings for SPCE. I am expecting to close next Friday around 45 and kill and calls and put. 

And we will have secondary around 40 by the end of the month. They have just 3 months of cash left and their commercials flights won't go in the air for the next 18 months. They will definitely need a lot of cash 

Chamath sold his personal SPCE stake in March at 27 for 221m. Who needs that much cash anyway? Given he is the biggest pumper and insider for SPCE, I cant expect secondary offered at more than 40.

Here's an overall landscape of how the options market closed today. Color is based on the put/call ratio. Green = Call dominant (0-1.0 P/C). Yellow = neutral (1.0-1.5 P/C). Red = Put dominant (1.50-5.0+ P/C). The size of the circles is scaled by total option premium. The bigger the circle, the more combined total premium.

Where is the best place to find out more information about how to invest? Is there a course on it? I know I have been lucky so far, but I want to know what the terms mean.  I know there is stuff on YouTube, but who do you recommend? I prefer to read, so is there a good website or book? 

My goal is to take my family to Disney this year with my investments.  I know that may be trivial to most, but my mom has cancer for the third time.  If I can invest in some good companies, I might be able to do this without taking from my own budget.  

Thanks for the help. 

Also, any penny stocks that seem like a really good investment would be appreciated!   I know 4000 isn’t a lot of money to most, but I really want to see what I can do with the original 500 dollars.  It is almost a challenge now.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** The SPY is gapping down pre market while QQQ is gapping up. Real estate was the leading sector last week and Coal was the leading industry. Both indices starting to get a bit extended off of the short term moving averages which is something to be aware of. The further we get extended away from moving averages, usually the tougher the intraday trading gets.  Intraday trading was not ideal Friday unless you were in select stocks. Pre market looks pretty weak at the time of writing this but could pick up closer to the market open.

Alcoa reports earnings on Thursday after the market closes which will kick off the 3rd quarter earnings season. Next week we should have more earnings plays to trade so that will be nice since earnings can be great catalysts for day trading. It is summer so I won't expect much because summers can be very slow even with earnings reports being released. This week I will remain focused on stocks with heavy volume. Good luck out there.

921,Beachbody ($BODY) DD,"So, I did a DD on $PTON a few months ago, which brought me to this competitor company. I would’ve included it on my list of competitors in that post, but it hadn’t merged at the time.

I see this company as a potential 2-3x bagger either in the short-term or within 1-2 years, and here’s why.

**Overview:**

Beachbody ($BODY) is a fitness company that’s been operating for 20+ years (founded in 1998). They’ve just recently completed a three-way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness.

Beachbody has brought their digital content, fitness instructors and subscribers, as well as nutritional products to the table. Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment.

Under the name Beachbody, they plan to be a direct competitor of Peloton, but aiming at the “everyman” market as opposed to the health nut/upper-income market like Peloton. For that reason, their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper.

\--------------------------------------------------------

**Here’s what makes it look good:**

* 400 million in cash on hand
* Zero debt and 10% margin EBITDA (This is for Beachbody pre-merger and is according to an [interview](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/interview-beachbody-ceo-carl-daikeler-195052224.html) with Carl Daikeler)
* 3.2 million subscribers
* 95.8% month over month digital retention (94.8% average)
* 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021
* Has some big names on board – Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, Shaq

*(In 2018, Congdon co-founded a personalized nutrition programming and tracking app with ""*[*FaceTime*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) *for fitness"" live group classes called Openfit. The company acquired LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Ladder, which develops nutritional products to help athletes with severe cramping after James had issues in the 2014 NBA finals. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, James and Schwarzenegger remained minority stakeholders.  They are model influencers for the app and produce content/workouts for OpenFit and have 21 million and 73 million followers respectively.)*

* Has experienced CEOS directing things, especially in the area of digital content service – Kevin Mayer (ex-CEO of TikTok, and ex-VP of Disney+), Carl Daikeler (CEO and founder of Beachbody), Jon Longdon (CEO of OpenFit and co-founder of Beachbody)
* Has a relationship with LA Fitness, giving LA Fitness, Esporta  Fitness, and City Sports members the ability add OpenFit to their existing gym membership 
* Carl Daikeler claims he doesn’t plan to sell a single share (this is purely speculative so it depends on whether or not you trust he'd keep his word - I'm not banking on that tbh)

\------------------------------------------------------------

You can read more about the merger and the company’s info in [this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/forest-road-acquisition-corp-and-the-beachbody-company-announce-combined-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-for-beachbody-and-myx-2021-05-19-91591019?siteid=bigcharts&dist=bigcharts&tesla=y).

So, basically, we’ve got a company with experience, seemingly good financials, a massive subscriber pool (many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers), and excellent retention rate.

You can read about the details of expected earnings, their plans and products through the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f75fdc89cf35e7524ec4b54/t/6023f07523d4531acaea9e8b/1612968070409/Beachbody+PIPE+Presentation.pdf).

&#x200B;

**So, with all this promise, why is the price of the stock so low?**

Well, for one thing, it has just merged, and a drop after de-spacing while people lock in profits is common. Also, Beachbody hasn’t had much PR, so there hasn’t been a lot to push this stock up. It’s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low.

Market makers have been using this to their advantage, and are having a great time pushing around retail. They’ve been shorting it heavily, taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit.

For this reason, buying shares rather than options is the better choice imo. Last month, the MMs took the stock price down to precisely $9.99 at the very end of the day of expiry of $10 calls, so that they’d all expire worthless. The manipulation was blatant.

&#x200B;

**So, if MMs are controlling this stock, why am I bullish?**

Because all it takes is a bit of PR and volume, and this stock could take off. The MMs are controlling this right now because they can, but it’s impossible for that to last forever once there’s PR, earnings and the wider market recognises its value. They’ve shorted it HEAVILY, and last I read it was at approx. 27% short interest percentage, and only 40,000 shares ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy](https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy)) available to short.

It's also been the only other NYSE stock on the SSR list along with $AMC.

Catalysts are already starting which is recently pushing up the share price. What are the catalysts? PR, analyst PTs and earnings.

The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs – one at **$12** and another at **$16**, so analysts thus far are decidedly bullish on $BODY. Upon the $16 PT, the stock rose approx. 2 dollars. 

Also, this was pre-merger, but when Shaq did a single tweet about BODY, it jumped about 50 cents - $1.00 (I can't remember the exact amount) in a few minutes. 

This shows you how quickly the stock could rise on some good news.

Beachbody’s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing, so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months.

Now, I can’t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now, but the fact of the matter is, in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come, it’s highly unlikely they could maintain this low share price permanently. I believe that at some point they have to cover or reverse position.

&#x200B;

**Short Squeeze \*(No, I don't think this will happen!)**

Some people are talking about a short squeeze with regards to this stock, which, yes, it’s a potential short squeeze candidate, but if there’s one thing $GME and $AMC has shown us, it’s that you need a LOT of buying pressure to even have a chance of that. It’s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen, and I’m not hanging my hopes on that. The thing is, in my opinion, we don’t NEED a short squeeze here. The MMs must know that this isn’t a sustainable position for a growing company, but since we’re still early in the game, they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in.

A lot of people, including myself, aren’t selling because it’s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price. It’s only a matter of time.

**Competitors** (I go into them in more detail in my PTON DD so please read that in my post history if you want to know more about them. Here I'm going to talk about them with respect to BODY)

There are a lot of up-and-coming competitors, and they are only likely to increase, but I’m going to be looking at the main competitors at this time, or the ones that appear imo to have potential. They are as follows:

Peloton

Apple Fitness +

Nautilus

iFit/NordicTrack

\---------------------------------------------

**Peloton**

There's no denying Peloton ($PTON) is dominating right now. They're doing fantastically with their branding, marketing and innovation. Just recently, they announced a corporate program allowing companies to purchase Peloton packages for their employees. This is an excellent move as we come out of the pandemic, and I expect we'll see more moves like this in the future from Peloton.

I wrote DD on PTON a few months ago, so you can read more about them in my post history. So far (fingers crossed), my DD has been pretty spot on with that, and I'm still very bullish on it. The only thing I can see taking PTON down at this point are market corrections, which will take all our bubbly stocks down. If that happens, I see it recovering eventually since I do believe this is a future tech.

Do I think Beachbody will become as big as Peloton? At this point, no, I don't. Beachbody has had some big hits like P90X and Insanity in the past, and they have a lot going for them with respect to revenue and subscriber base. However, despite being the original ""at-home workout"" brand, they became outdated and in this new tech sector, they're following rather than innovating. 

In my opinion they will need to show some type of innovation to have a chance of investors seeing a long-term future with them. 

One current advantage they have is that they are a well-known name, and they are aiming for a target market that Peloton hasn't covered yet, which is the more casual fitness user/people on a budget. You can read more about their live classes and how they plan to compete with Peloton [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2021/05/19/beachbody-takes-on-peloton-with-bodi-live-interactive-workout-service/).

**Apple Fitness +**

Apple Fitness + is a potential threat mostly to Peloton, but only if they decide to produce equipment imo. Why? Because they have a massive subscriber base ready-made, and the ability to link a lot of products together. If it's just the app, it's competing with content only. For this reason, it's important for Peloton to get ahead of them and corner the market fast, especially in the commercial area so that they can become the industry standard.

For Beachbody, since it is aimed at the ""everyman"" and person-on-a-budget, while Apple could still take some market share, it's less likely to be steamrolled. Why? Because Apple aims at a similar market to Peloton - people with higher incomes. Apple is likely to be taking more market share from Peloton's target market than Beachbody's.

**Nautilus**

This one is useful to compare with since they are an ""everyman"" competitor with a stock price (sitting at $15.48 at time of writing). 

They originally went public through a reverse merger with Perspective in 1999. Their revenue last year was $553 million (Beachbody = $864 million in 2020).  They currently focus on at-home equipment. 

Their connected fitness service (JRNY) costs $19.99 per montt/$149 per year, or $9.99 per month on your own device. 

Again, they have here the edge in equipment while I believe Beachbody has the edge in content. I couldn't find information on their number of subscribers. However, JRNY was developed last year only, so it's relatively new suggesting a low amount of subscribers at present. Their app has 1,080 reviews with a pretty lousy 2.6 star rating while Beachbody has over 22,000 reviews and a 4.8 star rating.

**iFit/NordicTrack**

This also aims at the ""everyman"", and is looking to reinvent itself after Peloton's success. 

iFit and NordicTrack are both owned by ICON Health and Fitness - a company that's been around since the 1970s developing exercise equipment. It developed iFit and pairs it with its NordicTrack equipment. Last year it made revenue exceeding $1.5 billion and has a valuation of $7 billion. Currently, Beachbody made $864 million and is on track to make $1 billion revenue this year. It also has a valuation of approx. $3 billion.

You could say that ICON is coming from the opposite side, having specialized in equipment and now developing content, while Beachbody has specialized in content and is now using Myx Fitness to develop equipment, as well as combining their content. Beachbody will need to do some catch-up on NordicTrack when it comes to developing equipment since NordicTrack already has treadmills and ellipticals along with their bike. 

However, bear in mind that the real money-making area is subscriptions. Even for Peloton, equipment only make a small portion of their revenue since most people can't afford or don't have the space for a home gym. Therefore, the real competition is going to be in the content and how well companies can get people signed up to their apps + keeping them there. iFit has a mere 330,000 subscribers in comparison to Beachboy's 3.2 million.

For comparison equipment-wise, a NordicTrack bike starts from $1,599 and a Myx Fitness (Beachbody) bike starts from $1,299. NordicTracks come with a 1-year free subscription to iFit ($15/mo or $39/mo for a family plan).

&#x200B;

\*\*Overall, I could see Beachbody competing with iFit/NordicTrack/ICON and Nautilus in the future.

&#x200B;

**Bearish Points:**

1. *This company will fail because it’s got some MLM practices.*

Beachbody has a branch of their business called ""Team Beachbody"". You can become a ""coach"", and as a result, you get discounts on products by helping others workout and by selling products to other people. Beachbody claims it's not an MLM, but imo it clearly is. And there's no doubt that it's brought some bad rep to their company, and stops some people from wanting to invest.

It doesn't bother me as long as the company's making money, and I completely get if people don't want to invest for ethical reasons, or if they think it will cost the company in future. I could be wrong, but I'm of the opinion that unless they can reform that aspect of their business and pivot away from any MLM or scam-like practices, they don't have a chance of becoming a big contender in the industry long-term. Whether or not they do that, I don't know. 

However, I personally am not looking for it to become the next Peloton. I'm simply finding that, with its current revenue, subscribers, and projected revenue, it is very undervalued, and **that** I consider an opportunity. 

They have been in operation for 20+ years, much of it trading profitably, so it's a good sign for the future of it in a massive tech growth industry. The fitness industry itself is worth over $100 billion and growing rapidly, so there's a lot of money to go around. 

Also, we can see for comparison, full-on MLM companies like Herbalife and Avon (at its height) that have managed to operate successfully, albeit not at a Peloton-level. 

With their MLM aspect in play, I don't see this as a blue chip, hold-forever type of stock, but to get a good profit from the current stock price? It seems very promising because they CAN operate profitably and they are entering a growth industry.

2) *Things are still speculative. We haven’t seen their earnings yet.*

Yep, fair enough. There is still some risk in that regard. There’s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R&D and marketing will cut into their profits, possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was. However, this current market is very bullish and forward-looking, so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow, especially since it’s already so low. At this point, things are still volatile with the stock, and Beachbody needs to prove itself before we can expect the wider market to take notice. 

I'm not expecting this stock to launch into space, but providing there are no massive failures, it should come into its value.

3) *This is a pandemic stock. After the pandemic is over, it’ll crash along with Peloton.*

It certainly looks like we're in a bubble right now, and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst, or at least have a bunch of corrections. I can see it happening with Peloton at some point (it’s already had a correction though it’s climbing back up), but this stock price is already so low, it can’t really fall much further, so in that way it’s very low-risk compared to a lot of other investments. Great upside, small downside. Also, the pandemic has changed things permanently, and while I agree it has given stocks like PTON a big boost, I’m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future, so I’d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually, even if they happen to be brought down by corrections.

*4) They're not innovative. What is their moat?*

Beachbody has been innovative in the past. In 2015 they created Beachbody on Demand, which was to be the ""Netflix for fitness"". They were also the big name in home workouts, and came up with certain successes like P90x and Insanity. At-home workouts is Beachbody's territory.

However, as mentioned before, they have faded out and have become a market follower rather than a market leader. Peloton has taken that space and is doing it well. 

Do I think they have a moat right now? Over Peloton, my answer is no. Over other competitors aiming at the ""everyman"" market? Yes. They currently have an edge in their name, their ready-made content, and their ready-made subscribers. They also have in-depth knowledge of the at-home workout industry. How long they can keep that edge remains to be seen.

**Reviews**

To get an idea of how people see them here are some reviews I found-  

[Beachbody on Demand streaming service](https://www.amazon.com/Beachbody-Demand-Month-Membership-including/dp/B07485JMTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) (appears to be pre-merger reviews)

[Beachbody app](http://www.apprview.com/health-fitness/beachbody-on-demand/)  Here are

[Bodi](https://www.productreview.com.au/listings/bodi) (their drinks)

[TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.beachbody.com) (the general company so different aspects) - This one is the most bearish sign imo since there have been recent complaints about customers having trouble unsubscribing and being changed. If they can't fix that, they'll be in trouble.

**Summary:**

While they could always surprise me, based on their past failures in innovation, I'm not expecting Beachbody to be the next Peloton. However, they've managed to operate profitably for many years, and they have some advantage entering into this new take on the fitness industry. Having the ex-TikTok and ex-Disney+ CEO on board is a bullish sign for me since he should be able to help them significantly with their digital pivot. My hope also is that he can help them with innovation and branding. Myx Fitness too should bring in some fresh thinking. 

I'm not looking at this stock as being one of the big boys of the future, but as a decent competitor in its respective target market. For this reason, I'm bullish that it can achieve a 2-3 x increase within the next 1-2 years, if not sooner. 

**Disclosure:** I currently have 1,100 shares at $10.34. My PT is between $15-18 in the short-term providing the overall market stays bullish, and $25-35 within 1-2 years. I took some profit on the latest spike, and am letting the rest ride.

**In this article:**

* [**GME**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME)\-6.91%

Meme-stock and cryptocurrency investors alike are [speculating](https://twitter.com/search?q=gamestop%20nft&src=typed_query) on Twitter about whether today is the day that the company will introduce a non-fungible token, or NFT. Non-fungible tokens are digital assets that integrate some object, such as a piece of artwork, video, or anything that the creator can imagine, including a game apparently.

Based on the source code of a GameStop blockchain contract, July 14 had emerged as the speculative launch date for the NFT. That theory is losing its luster, however, as the clock continues to tick. That doesn’t mean that a GameStop NFT isn’t in the works.

A GameStop NFT [website](https://nft.gamestop.com/) has already been launched, fueling the speculation that the unveiling of the gaming token is not too far behind. Plus the company [recently](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-finestone-cfa-7bb8ba51/?originalSubdomain=ca) brought on Matthew Finestone as head of blockchain.

Investors are anxiously awaiting the details of what the digital token will have to offer and have begun to unpack the coding tied to a cryptocurrency wallet address for clues. Solidity developer and Twitter account u/0xfoobar is reportedly [behind](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/gamestop-nfts) the GameStop blockchain contract and has seemingly been busy building the NFT. The GameStop team has been keeping the details of a gaming NFT close to the vest, but the launch [could be tied](https://twitter.com/rensole/status/1415339327517777922) to the [Ethereum](https://www.fxempire.com/crypto/eth) network upgrade.

**Gaming and NFTs**

Gaming is a natural fit for NFTs, given that gamers are already accustomed to buying in-game virtual assets like skins, currency and more to up the ante. The most popular NFTs have been known to sell for tens of millions of dollars. A GameStop NFT could generate some excitement both in the blockchain industry and among traditional gamers, which has the potential to spill over into the stock to give it a much-needed jolt.

GameStop, the meme stock that started it all, has seen its value decline by close to 20% in the month of July so far. Year-to-date, shares of GameStop have gained more than 800%. Short interest in the stock hovers at 13.3% and has increased more than 9% in recent days, as per S3 Partners data [cited by CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/amc-share-price-cut-in-half-as-reality-sets-in-for-meme-stock-investors.html).

**Meme Stock Malaise**

July is almost halfway over and meme stock investors are licking their wounds after a bout of declines. Based on the activity on Reddit and other social media platforms, retail investors are holding, for the most part, and waiting for their fortunes to turn around. They are also getting tired of seeing red day after day as their strategy to squeeze sophisticated traders hits a bump in the road.

The major meme stocks are still up for the year and have outperformed the broader markets, but they have tumbled in recent weeks. Some are blaming it on the rise of inflation rather than anything company-specific in their favorite stocks. Either way, the bears appear to be in control for the time being as trading volumes weaken and the summer doldrums kick in. It is nothing a GameStop NFT could potentially fix, but when that will become a reality is the question.",2021-07-15 08:23:43

**Outlook/Game Plan:** All indices are gapping down pre-market after selling off yesterday. SPY and QQQ are still above short term moving averages, we will have to see if they hold up today.  Very few stocks moved higher yesterday with any significant percentage increase but over 500 moved lower. Even though the SPY and QQQ have looked strong, individual stocks continue to sell off under the hood. This week we have seen very back and forth intraday action with most stocks taking time to find good follow through. I did ok yesterday but decided to stop after the first hour as I don't enjoy this type of trading. 

Not much interests me pre-market, very few stocks look great for trading. Alcoa reports earnings today after the market closes which will kick off earnings season, hopefully we can see some better trading action soon. If I cannot find anything interesting before the market opens, I'll run a scan at the open. If that doesn't seem promising, I'll just take the day off and save my cash for a better day. good luck trading.

(Bloomberg) -- It was the type of master stroke that could make a Wall Street career. Jason Mudrick’s financing of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. at the height of the pandemic netted his hedge fund hundreds of millions of dollars in just a few months.

Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone. Options contracts meant to hedge the bullish wager went haywire as retail traders flocked to AMC’s stock, pushing shares to once unimaginable heights and costing Mudrick Capital Management all of its gains -- and more.

Distressed investors have long had to have thick skins -- taking criticism as predators, even as they sometimes rescue firms no one else will touch and generate returns for pensions, endowments and foundations. But life in the business is getting even harder, as they can no longer count on a predictable stock market to hedge massive, multipronged bets.

With equities swept up in the whims of exuberant day traders, some funds are now being forced to rethink their business models.

“It’s become a much harder calculus to even consider,” said Scott Hartman, the global co-head of corporate credit and trading at $14 billion investment firm Varde Partners. “Frankly, many funds have decided to stay away from shorting these stocks altogether.”

Granted, there are other investment opportunities -- some distressed funds are pivoting to private lending and emerging-market plays -- and often other ways that money managers can hedge their exposures or engage in forms of capital-structure arbitrage (plenty of their targets, after all, have no public equity.)

But fiscal and monetary stimulus have greased markets so thoroughly that many of the riskiest companies are now breezing through debt walls with cheap new financing, rather than running into the kind of dead-ends and defaults that generate restructurings or profitable loan-to-own plays.

**Fewer Failures**

Indeed, many fund managers say that beyond disrupting their ability to hedge, retail traders are increasingly propping up troubled firms, further limiting the universe of investment opportunities.

Clothing chain Express Inc., prison operator Geo Group Inc., coal miner Peabody Energy Corp. and others have, like AMC, seized on their popularity among day traders to seek equity financing -- an option historically out of reach for firms with their debt loads.

That’s a problem for distressed-credit funds, where corporate failure is a key part of the investment thesis.

Their strategies often center on identifying companies that are out of options, providing last-resort financing and calling the shots throughout the workout process. Their controversial tactics -- in which workers are often left bearing the brunt of the pain -- can lead to huge payoffs, including outright ownership of the cleaned-up corporations.

Yet opportunities are dwindling.

“It’s eerily quiet out there,” said Colin Adams, a senior managing director at corporate advisory firm M3 Partners, where he focuses on debt restructuring. “You have the twin monsters of fiscal stimulus and low interest rates, and this phenomenon with meme stocks adds a whole new dynamic.”

**Irrational Incentives**

Even companies careening toward default are no longer reliable targets for funds that use short equity bets to hedge or enhance their credit plays.

Investors confronted this reality with a trio of mall owners that filed for bankruptcy over the past year -- CBL & Associates, Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and Washington Prime Group Inc.

All three saw their stock prices fluctuate -- often surging on little underlying news -- as they approached and then entered Chapter 11, where shareholder value gets wiped out almost as a rule.

Brian Sheehy, the founder of IsZo Capital Management, which takes long and short positions across firms’ capital structures, started shorting the mall owners as they began to buckle under the weight of unpaid rent and monthslong store closures.“I predicted they would go bankrupt, and I was right -- but I still lost money,” Sheehy said. “This stuff now will go straight up into your face until the day they file,” he said, adding that “the incentives are all thrown off.”

**Meme Irony**

The irony is that achieving meme-stock status can sometimes be a boon not only for companies, but also their creditors.

Mudrick was initially one of the big winners of the Reddit-driven rally in AMC’s shares. After buying up the company’s battered bonds, his fund late last year provided $100 million in financing via complex pay-in-kind toggle notes, while receiving about 22 million shares. Those netted a handsome paper profit after the stock surged as much as 839% in January.

At the same time AMC was able to target retail demand for more than $1 billion in equity financing via so-called at-the-market offerings, which it used in part to pay down debt.

Yet what starts out as a stroke of good fortune can quickly turn into a burden for sophisticated hedge funds, which rely on markets staying rational to support their complex bets.

Call options Mudrick sold to protect the firm’s holdings from a market plunge -- most of which gave other investors the right to buy shares from him at $40 or more, well above any price at which they had ever traded -- would suddenly turn into massive liabilities by early June, as the company’s stock surged above $60.

Mudrick -- whose firm last month exited its AMC debt and derivative positions -- declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg.

The theater chain’s shares closed Wednesday at $33.43, part of a wider retreat in so-called meme stocks in recent days.

AMC didn’t respond to a request seeking comment.

**Bankruptcy Blues**

As for the few companies that do default or enter bankruptcy these days, retail traders are disrupting outcomes for credit funds there, too. More than once this year, money managers deep into monthslong restructuring negotiations have had to essentially start from scratch as company fortunes changed.

“The volatility makes it harder for the parties to coalesce around a restructuring plan,” said Dominique Mielle, a former partner at Canyon Capital Advisors and the author of an upcoming book on distressed debt. “One day the equity of the company has no value and the next it does -- that upends the previous day’s work.”

Washington Prime entered Chapter 11 last month with a bankruptcy plan crafted with its largest lender, distressed fund SVPGlobal. The money manager was set to be rewarded for its risk-taking and diligence with a swift court process and ownership of the restructured company.

Now it’s facing objections and delays from equity holders who -- emboldened by Washington Prime’s relatively healthy $2 stock price as well as the successes of firms like Hertz Global Holdings Inc. in preserving shareholder value -- are demanding a larger payout.

“As investors, we can’t just say these are punks and they’re bidding up a stock for no reason,” Mielle said. “That may be so individually, but collectively they’re a market power and you’ve got to take that into account.”",2021-07-15 08:59:25
930,Closing vertical spreads,"Hey r/options,

So I've only recently started trading options. The past 2.5 months I've been exclusively selling weekly CSPs and have been doing pretty well (~.6% / week avg). As I've sold a good number of contracts on GME/AMC over time I've started to wonder if with those meme stocks in particular I should be selling bull put spreads instead to limit some risk but was always afraid of closing them out correctly. On top of that, after giving myself what I thought was a reasonable ~20% buffer on AMC this week, the first 3 days were crazy and I did end up closing out some positions at 34 at a... loss. Of course now it will probably close above 34; either way I screwed up by not defining a stop loss price level beforehand.

What worries me is this case: say I sold a 32/31 AMC spread and the underlying was way below 31 on Friday at closing. It's my understanding that you have until 5:30 PM EST with most brokers to decide whether or not to exercise options. So what if whoever is on the other end of my short leg (32) waits until 5:29:59 to make me buy the shares, then my long leg (31) immediately expires? It seems like there must be a way to avoid that situation and guarantee that I can sell my shares at my long leg's strike?

I'm also not sure if this post was better suited for r/thetagang or something?

931,Anyone else tired of this market?,"Am I getting crushed in this market? No of course not. I am not that dumb. But I am tired of this market.

""Oh this market is too highly overvalued, its due for a pull back""

Like I frankly dont understand how the market does not go up another 10-15% prior to the end of the year. Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are literally >10% of the market and they will be posting huge numbers. JPM said there was a 22% increase in consumer spending compared to 2nd qrt of 2019. Where do you think they spent that money? Shopify? Etsy? Apple is moving up strong because they are going to report a storng qrt. I literally know nobody who has bought something from Shopify. I have zero friends who own a Tesla. Literally raise your hand if you have a fully electric vehicle. That number is so low its not going to 80% of people in the nnext 5 years. Enphase? Who tf even uses them? Literally, all my electricity comes from hydro and the 10 million people who live around me. Zillow is at 615 P/E, Redfin is over 5,000 P/E. Have you ever used Zillow or Redfin to do anything rather than look for houses. I was looking at Redfin 10Q and they only have 45k monthly users. 45k?!?!?!?! I bet Amway has more than 45k monthly users.

AMC, GME, SPCE, and all the other meme stocks are overvalued. Micron is trading at a P/E's in the 20s and they make memory chips. Does anyone realize what the demand for memory chips will be? Everything that is done in this world is recorded and stored.

Maybe its just me, but a lot of people and a lot of institutions have money and what are people going to do with it? Buy a 650k house in Boise Idaho? Please. Get yourself a bond that has a negative real yield of almost 3%? Grow up.

Call me stupid but the big dogs I mentioned above will all be worth 2 trillion and it will be justified because they rule our lives. The biggest threat to this market is the government trying to break up the big dogs. Amazon is getting scrutinized for buying MGM studieos. IDK why their streaming service is shit and they have pissed around for too long with it. Let them buy MGM studios, they will probably piss it away like the Whole Foods aquisition.

932,Position Sizing - New Trader,"Hi all! I’m a pretty new trader here with a question about position sizing. I’ll put a bit about me with a tldr of the question at the bottom. 

I bought my first shares of anything 6 months ago but it was less than $10 and I didn’t do anything with them. Then I hit a big pop on AMC, threw in some money, made $300 in 20 minutes or so and was like “wow call me Cathie Burry because my stocks go brr”. Cut to me getting my overconfident ass handed to me of course. 

I added 25k to my account to meet PDT and have been trading more seriously since. I’ve had a pretty harsh past week and found myself trading emotionally. I thought every dip followed by a green bar on the one minute chart meant it had found new support. I knew that wasn’t how it worked but also not that well apparently. 

I’m only using $2000 of the 25k to trade with because that’s really all I’m comfortable losing, the rest is just a savings account basically. 

I’ve since parked some of my trading money in SPY and today i trading using no more than 1% of my account per trade and was able to be a lot more cool headed. I also managed to get in on some stuff during the quick SPY crash. 

I had been taking position sizes around 10% and even though I’d made peace with losing that money intellectually, I still kind of panicked when it would drop. By using MACD, RSI, 5 minute chart for trends and 1 minute for entries, I managed to identify a lot of good trades. I made 8 trades at the end of the day using 1% of my account and came out profitable on 7.  

So great, I’m up 1.5% on a trade which culminates to a staggering $0.35. I could use some more successful days to build up confidence I suppose but it’s unfortunate to pick winners and have them be so small. That said, I know I’m new and just not being run out of town is something to be happy with. 

TLDR: Do any of you have a recommended position size that you follow or that you’d advise for a new trader? I mismanaged trades and lost a fair bit and improved my judgement after taking 1% of my account in trades but it’s a very slow going approach. Additionally, any advice on exits? Most of the money I lost this week were mild gains that I held because I thought it’d go up closer to resistance only to get stopped out beneath support.",2021-07-15 16:28:33

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY and QQQ both higher pre market after testing the 9 ema on the daily chart and finding support. Yesterday, the Utilities sector led the market but not by much as there was not much growth in anything. 

Summer time trading is in full effect and we can see that by the intraday action as well as the pre-market action. Today when I ran my scan in the pre-market I have found the least amount of gaps from any morning in over a year.  Many times on these type of mornings, volume will pour into the market closer to the open but I am skeptical about that today. On the other hand, We have not had any decent day this week as far as percentage gains go and usually there is at least one strong day per week so they could surprise us. Alcoa reported earnings so next week we should hopefully have some better opportunities as far as earnings plays go. 

No one likes to take the day off, including myself, but if I don't see anything I like, I'll probably just take the day off from trading. Either I'll take the day off or I will trade very small so I do not incur any significant losses. It's Friday and I'm not about to have a rough trading day before the weekend. Good luck out there, have a great couple days off, see you all Monday!

937,"Underlying goes up, value of contract...does whatever the hell it wants?","I don't typically watch my options that closely so maybe this is normal for some reason but I could not wrap up head around what I was watching this morning.

I own some AMC shares and bought some 7/30 $80 calls.  There was a nice little pop in the after hours trading and the stock opened up about 3%.  So I expected to see the value of the contracts go up as well.  In actuality it went down about 7%.  After opening they tracked together for a while.  Then we got to a point where the stock was either flat or going down and the value of the contract was up.  Fidelity is telling me that the stock price is currently up 3.69% but the call is down   


I understand that that they're not going to track along the same path dollar for dollar, but I assumed they would at least track along the same direction.  Was this Theta doing something weird?  I'm expecting this to expire OTM so the plan is to sell early and try to profit on the premium.  But apparently I need a better understanding of how the value of the premium changes.

The usefulness lies in the fact that the lower gamma exposure is the higher is the volatility of that particular stock price, since when gamma < 0 market-makers' actions amplify moves both up and down. So a probable way to time the volatility spike.

The issue though is that squeeze metrics calculates GEX from the open interest, assuming that market makers buy calls and write puts.. which is probably ok for the names like AAPL or AMZN but a no-go for the names like GME or AMC.

&#x200B;

**Outlook/Game Plan:** After a slow week of back and forth action in the market, and a nice sell off Friday, the pullback continues. Last week the Utilities Sector led the market with Communication Services following behind. The action we had intraday was pretty slow, and less than ideal. This week we have some earnings plays to look forward to and next week should be even better.

All the indices are gapping down pre market as well as about a million stocks. SPY and QQQ are both under their 20 day moving averages. DIA is under it's 50 DMA and IWM is getting close to hitting the 200 DMA. Next support on SPY is the 50 Daily moving average, which is around the 423 area. This is a significant gap and usually major gap days are tough to trade. As always we may get a bounce at the initial open but occasionally the gap holds, today could be one of those days.

Since there are so many gaps on my main list today (over 400 at 8:20 Est), I will only select a few of which I believe will provide good opportunities for trading. On these days there will be plenty of stocks that will move, but I stick to what works best for me. If the market does sell off hard, I will look for opportunities in Inverse ETF's, primarily UVXY.

If you are new to trading or do not feel comfortable. There is no shame in sitting these days out. Observing price action is beneficial during these days and it's hard to observe while you are getting slaughtered. Trading small is also an option. Good luck out there.

By [Connor Smith](https://www.barrons.com/authors/8589?mod=article_byline)

July 20, 2021 6:24 pm ET 

 After a [lackluster month](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-stock-51626349248?mod=article_inline) for shares of [AMC Entertainment Holdings](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AMC) and [GameStop](https://www.barrons.com/quote/GME), both roared higher on Tuesday, burning short sellers along the way. 

On Tuesday, [AMC Entertainment](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AMC) stock (ticker: AMC) surged 24% to $43.09 while [GameStop](https://www.barrons.com/quote/GME) stock (GME) closed up 10% to $191.18. Both posted their highest close since July 9. GameStop stock is still down 10.7% month-to-date, while AMC stock is down 24% in July, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

AMC and GameStop are [the two major meme stocks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meme-stock-trade-far-from-over-51625875118?mod=article_inline)—meaning their daily price movements are often unpredictable, having more to do with factors like social media chatter, options and momentum trading quirks, and short seller activity. Several analysts [have dropped coverage](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meme-stock-analysts-throwing-in-the-towel-51625093768?mod=article_inline) on GameStop, arguing it no longer trades based on fundamentals.

Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling data provider S3 Partners, told *Barron’s* he estimates 75.8 million AMC shares are sold short, or roughly 15% of shares available for trading. There has been some covering, as he estimates shares shorted are down by about 4 million over the last week. But with the stock up $8.47 on Tuesday, short sellers were down $642 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday alone, bringing the year-to-date losses to $3.82 billion.

For GameStop, he estimates about 7.9 million shares shorted, or 14% of shares available for trading, down by about a million shares over the last week. Based on those numbers, short sellers were down $139.8 million on Tuesday, bringing year-to-date losses to $6.32 billion.

AMC did give investors [some news to chew on](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-stock-covid-fears-space-jam-box-office-51626713962?mod=article_inline). After the close on Monday, the company said it was adding two former Pacific Theatres locations in the Los Angeles area. It also said it’s in discussions with other property owners regarding adding more closed locations. Consolidation would be good for AMC, but it would take bold assumptions to justify the stock’s current levels.

There was no such news for GameStop to justify the move—though late Monday night chairman Ryan Cohen posted a photo of himself with [chopsticks in his nose](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1417315406272864258?s=20) with the caption “PG-13.” Reddit users [for months](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-is-surging-again-and-no-one-can-say-why-51614208357?mod=article_inline) have speculated wildly based on every emoji, GIF, [and photo](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-30-something-cohen-consolidates-power-at-gamestop-and-the-reddit-crowd-cheersbut-the-stock-is-so-so-11617904869) that the Chewy co-founder has shared on Twitter.

What comes next for the meme stocks is anyone’s guess. Wall Street pros [have been calling for a crash](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meme-stock-crash-coming-michael-burry-51625094355?mod=article_inline) for months, but meme stocks have held up, albeit with plenty of volatility along the way. Eventually the companies will need to [put their cash to work](https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-sell-amc-stock-51622844305?mod=article_inline) and justify these elevated valuations. Just not yet, apparently.",2021-07-20 19:12:55

**Outlook/Game Plan:** The Energy sector led the market yesterday. Coal, Oil& Gas Drilling, and Semiconductor Equipment & Material were the top 3 leading industries. Saw some money flow into Auto Manufacturers as well after NIO held the 200 DMA. Yesterday was some of the best intraday trading action we've seen in gapping stocks for quite some time.

SPY and QQQ both gapping up pre-market. Plenty of earnings reports have been released and today we have some reactions we can trade. I am often asked if I hold stocks through earnings or buy in anticipation of earnings. The only stocks I will hold through earnings are long term investments. I never hold a swing trade through earnings Sure you can make some good money but you can also lose big time. Stocks with earnings can gap down just as easily as they can gap up and you can take some extreme losses. In my opinion, the risk outweighs the reward. I just trade the reactions.

Lots of small caps gapping pre-market but I will start focusing on mid and large caps through earnings season. Today my plan is to focus on stocks with earnings catalysts as they usually make the quickest, cleanest moves. Plenty to trade today but keep in mind there are lots of gap ups in the pre-market. The SPY and QQQ are also up 3 days in a row so there could be some selling at the open, we may not get any but stay vigilant. Good luck trading.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Technology was the leading sector yesterday. The top 3 Industries were Restaurants, Footwear & Accessories, and Software - Infrastructure in that order. Intraday action was good for a Thursday. Next week we have the FOMC meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday (July 27+28). This could be a case where trading slows down for a couple days but may not be the case depending on earnings releases.

So far the market is reacting positive to earnings as there is a big gap up in the SPY this morning pre-market as well as the QQQ. Chinese stocks are still getting hammered in the pre-market as authorities step up restrictions on the private education industry. Usually when the indices are gapping up significantly there will be many more gap ups, but this morning this is not the case. There are a lot more gap downs on my main watch list this morning than gap ups. I am not a fan of trading big gap days so I will be cautious in my approach today even though Friday's are statistically my best days. My focus will remain on earnings plays. Good luck trading!

[AMC Entertainment Holdings](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AMC) CEO Adam Aron has another title. The movie theater operator [named Aron chairman of its board](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Appoints-Adam-Aron-as-Chairman-of-the-Board--CEO-and-Philip-Lader-as-Lead-Director/default.aspx) following the resignations of non-executive chairman Lin Zhang and Director Mao Jun Zeng.

After [surging 24%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meme-stocks-gamestop-and-amc-bounce-back-short-sellers-got-burned-again-51626819848?mod=article_inline) on Tuesday, [AMC](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AMC) stock (ticker: AMC) fell 5.4% to $40.78 Wednesday. [GameStop](https://www.barrons.com/quote/GME) stock (GME) dropped 2.8% to $185.81, while the [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX) index rose 0.8%.

Aron, who regularly communicates with the company’s retail investors via social media, [posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1417820070424743937?s=20), “As CEO & President of AMC for 5 1/2 years, I am flattered that last night the AMC Board of Directors elected me to serve now as Chairman of the Board also (as well as CEO & President too). I will do my best to act with honor and distinction in these roles.”

Philip Lader was also tapped to be the board’s lead director. The former U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James’s has been an independent director on AMC’s board since July 2019.

Zhang and Zeng are both senior executives at Wanda Group—the Chinese company that was a controlling shareholder in AMC between 2012 and 2020. Wanda Group [exited its position in AMC in May](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-stock-wanda-america-entertainment-51622837516?mod=article_inline). Wanda America Entertainment sold 30,445,290 AMC shares between May 13 and May 18 at an average selling price of $14.22, for a total of $426.9 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the following weeks, AMC shares hit as high as $72.62.

AMC and [GameStop](https://www.barrons.com/quote/GME) are [both meme stocks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meme-stock-trade-far-from-over-51625875118?mod=article_inline), meaning their daily movements are often volatile and unpredictable. They generally are impacted by [non fundamental factors](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meme-stock-analysts-throwing-in-the-towel-51625093768?mod=article_inline) like short seller activity, options volume, momentum trading, and online chatter. While AMC stock [has fallen a bit in July](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-stock-51626349248?mod=article_inline), Tuesday’s surge took a cut out of short sellers, bringing year-to-date losses to $3.82 billion, according to data from S3 Partners.

Aron has stood out among meme stock chiefs through his efforts to appeal to retail investors on social media sites like Reddit. He’s unveiled [a rewards program for shareholders](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-investor-connect-stock-51622644690?mod=article_inline) and even appeared in interviews with [YouTube commentators](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amcs-ceo-pledges-not-to-issue-shares-this-analyst-says-thats-good-news-51618596672?mod=article_inline). He’s donated to their charity of choice: [the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://www.barrons.com/articles/movie-theater-stocks-leap-despite-quarterly-losses-51620424431?mod=article_inline).

The company has cashed in on its meme stock status. Analysts at S&P Global Ratings upgraded the company’s debt by two notches to CCC+ in June, noting the company raised more than $1.8 billion in [equity issuance so far this year](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-credit-upgrade-stock-51623368502?mod=article_inline). AMC [canceled a shareholder vote](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-backs-off-on-vote-for-more-stock-sales-reddit-crowd-rejoices-51625614531?mod=article_inline) on a proposal that would have allowed the company to issue 25 million more shares starting in 2022, pointing to investor sentiment.

949,Rules I always tell myself to Follow - and never do (please feel free to add on or call out a bad rule),"Sooooo I have been day trading for 4-5 months now.. and im admittedly down, and its because i have rules, rules that if i do not follow, i usually get burned... my problem - I NEVER FOLLOW MY OWN DAMN Rules! This post is an admittance of fault, with the promise to do better... 

So here is some rules I try to follow and never do:

1. **If you want to trade based on a goal, and you reach that goal... STOP TRADING!!!! - if the goal is X up and Y down - once you hit these... STOP just STOP**
   1. So many times I have set a goal to reach 100,500,1000... a lot of times i hit these goals, am happy. walk away for an hour, and then come back---- and then i lose, usually its my entire gain and then some
2. **FOLLOW YOUR PLAN!!!!!!**
   1. My goal has a very clear enter and exity strategy, look at the one minute when there are enough factors telling me to buy in - once i get a peak over 5-SMA and then the next open stays above the 5-SMA for awhile, and as long as the factors surrounding it (candle sticks, trends, golden cross yada yada) , I will buy in - if it falls below 5-sma, i sell (usually i set as a stop loss a few cents below the sma so its automatic... HOWEVER!!!...sometimes i dont set the auto sell and i hold and hope it bounces back..... and i lose
   2. On the contrary, a stock i buy blows sky high.  The green candles are sky scrapers, and i see it, a red stick..... i should sell and sell ASAP! this is the peak(i tell myself) SELL AT PEAK AND WIN THE DAY!!!!!..... i sell..... and BOOM the secondary rocket goes off and more sky scrapers appear... i just lost X amount beause i didn't just follow my damn plan and wait for the SMA cross down
3. **NEVER PLAY MEME STOCKS BASED ON FEELINGS ( EDIT:OR ANY STOCK - SEE #b)**
   1. Fucking AMC - i have won big.. and i have lost bigger, usualy because i think ooga booga apes are going to turn it around - i have this feeling that ""apes would do this right now.. id do this if i were an ape..... totaly would just throw my paycheck at AMC.. tis struggling gotta keep it up.... it doesn't matter all indicators show its a falling knife.... we just say green for a candle... BUY BUY BUY  --- needless to say this fails me big time, and its a mental game i really need to stop playing with myself
   2. You're favorite stock has REALLY good news... so you buy in even though its in a down trend.... sell at loss... buy in again.. waiting for it to move up because of the news.... but the news never was reflected in the stock.... it happens... don't blindly buy in because you heard good news..... its only one catalyst.. make sure there is an uptrend occuring, and the stock is showing strnegth.... then with the catalyst as the cherry on the top.. you will be sure to win
4. **IF YOU'RE IN QUICK SAND, STOP MOVING**
   1. Here is probably my biggest mistake in trading, panick buys and sells... i am negative for the day... so i have to make any trade to get back up.... panick buy... poop, need to sell, panick buy again... need to sell..... now im worse off... crap.. ok new stock... panick buy, it seems alright... need to sell........ At this point im panicking all over the place and just trying to flip a coin and hoping it comes up in my favor, it rarely does... so i reccomend just stop... accept the small loss, and just leave for the day.... or the hour... regroup.. get your footing back before you come back... if its near the end of the day STOP!
5. **STOP PLAYING STOCKS AFTER NOON or 1 EST (or at least stop playing non volatile stocks)**
   1. So this may be my most controversial rule, but i have never had a good day afrer my 11-1130am trades.. usually its where the slippery slope comes into play, and usually where i start messing up RULE #1(greed)  The old saying is, what goes up must come down, but in stocks, you always hope, what goes up.. will keep going up.  Not always the truth.  My favorite stock of the day is super green at this point, i have enough money to pay for my coke and hookers for the night, and i should stop (this is a joke, i barely even drink).. but no, it got me THIS FAR, i should probably keep going.... ok buy... well that was a beat down.... buy again..... ok i think a down trend is starting to happen, to early to tell...... buy again... o kbeat... im following my rules.. WTF... (to be fair this rule mostly is an assist or a caveat to rule number 1.... if I am not at my goals(up or down) i should just stop now
6. **EDIT - Last minute rule.... Make sure you aren't buying, just because you are bored**
   1. You see a stock, its mostly sideways, but shows a small bit of upward trend, the other indicators are iffy, but still ""ok"", ask yourself.. would i normaly play this? - sometimes you can convince yourself a stock is good, but only beause you are bored.  DONT PLAY IF YOU ARE JUST DIVING FOR ANY LOOSE BALL!!!!

I hope this helps? -

Anyone feel i am severely off with these, please lend your two cents... i want us all to be winners and drive our lambos and astons... or at least have enought to supersize every Drive Through meal we get

&#x200B;

***COMMUNITY ADDED RULES! (i would like to add aything i see interesting in the comments to this section)***

1. **SOMETIMES YOUR BEST TRADE, WILL TO BE NOT TO TRADE AT ALL**
  - this leans on my rule 6, my ""are you just bored rule"" but it's a good point. If you really aren't seeing any good moves, then just maybe don't make moves....the worst thing you can do is play a sort of good set up, only to hope for a win
2. **MAYBE SET A POINT OF NO RETURN **
 - this rule maybe be hard to come to grips with, but....maybe, for one reason or another, you should stop day trading... I have had this rule in place and I'm not on top of it.. But im slightly closer now than when I started (to see why, review rules above lol)... But honestly.... Have a complete exit stratagy.... Maybe a limit set... And if you hit that limit you walk away from trying to be a day trader, and accept that you may not have the time to learn or the attention and discipline needed to keep playing.... Or maybe you're already rich enoiuh from killing it and the stress isn't worth it anymore (let's hope it's the latter)",2021-07-24 21:34:55

Then I also bought some AMC for the following week, that worked out alright though because it was a Friday and I had questions I called Etrade to execute as opposed to allowing it to execute automatically. They advised me that I might be better off just closing it but I bought anyway. No big deal. 

Both options were relatively small amounts of money. 

Well this jackass, having gone away for the week for a yearly lake trip with my wife, kids, and in-laws saw the split finally went through and thought shit, I’ve always wanted in on NVDA… I guess I’ll buy 1 share at 192.0x

But also, having been attempting front flips all week and drinking mezcal like my life depended on it, apparently my risk tolerance was ramped. 

I decided to purchase 1 contract at 193.50, thinking this is smart… it’ll obviously go up. 

And it did, but I bought on whatever day the split happened, Monday? 

So now by Friday I was somehow in the money and also had lost value. 

Confused, I executed Friday. 

Oh yea, on margin. Now for further detail, I did call to ask some questions and part of my rational was that I won’t get interest charges on my roughly $20k until Tuesday or Wednesday because the option doesn’t execute till post closing on Friday, so the settlement date is 3 business days later. So I could avoid at least that charge. 

My question is:

Why did the option seem less valuable even after it was in the money, is it because, given my cost + premium the amount I paid was higher than the closing price? 

And more importantly did I do the right thing (outside of using margin which I try to avoid like the plague and have maybe only done 2 times before)? If not, what should the play have been? Does it seem overpriced? 

Thanks, I’m probably an idiot but I can take the heat.",2021-07-25 20:56:12
951,Adjusting Margin Calls with Naked Shorting,"Just read a good article on how hedge funds will short shares of a stock that do not exist; aka naked shorting.

Not real educated in the topic and everything will be out in its simplest terms. But if Citadel is the market maker, it seems like they can set their own price (no matter how cheap it is for them) in order to average down by borrowing however many shares they want (whether real or synthetic) but never get margin call because they keep averaging down with fake shares in order to stay within their margin.

Normal short sale process:
(1) Institutional investors lend long positioned stocks.
(2) Short seller borrows 10 shares of AMC Stock.
(3) Short seller sells 10 shares of AMC Stock for $500.
(4) Stock loses value 
(5) Short seller buys 10 shares of AMC Stock for $400.
(6)Short seller returns 10 shares of AMC Stock and keeps $100.
(7) Institutional investor receives a return.

Now I do believe it’s a fact that Short sales require margin equal to 150% of the value of the position at the time the position is initiated, and then the maintenance margin requirements come into play from that point forward.

Now the short seller paid $500 for 10 shares ($50/share) but being a market maker couldn’t they change this $500 to buy 100 shares (10 real, 90 synthetic) giving them a price of $5/share? If so, doesn’t this make it unlikely that they will be margin called and that more attention should be put on tracking/tracing the real shares as the synthetic shares would be null?",2021-07-25 22:00:02

953,Part 1: Risk management for the Aggressive Retail Trader: Buying options,"So I've been thinking about risk management in a way that works for the new aggressive retail trader. The traditional 1% of your portfolio value in trades(PV= $10,000 thus each trade should be $100)  is the recommendation but might not be worth your time or seem realistic.

Heck, if you are working a decent job and have a good budget on your finances you might be willing to sacrifice a bit more is probably what you're thinking.

Well that's what I did and it brought me great success in 2020 and 2021 so far. Though I'm not recommending everyone that needs to do this. This is mostly for the aggressive trader.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d7rb0wakfud71.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0ec14b608176b8e35b7098a84870c999d71b0eac

We are in a new era of trading where we get excited about yolo gains but ignore the fact that this is a small sample size of a mass group of people. We tend to leave out does that fail and how times has that person failed to get to that point.  Well this is survivorship bias in action. Any who, you might be  thinking.. If that person can get 400% gain, I can at least get 100% or a piece of that. Very motivating..inspiring..intoxicating..right?

However if catch yourself throwing more than 30% of your portfolio value into just ONE TRADE…then this is for you to put the brakes on sabotaging your account and prevent you from quitting.

&#x200B;

*Buying options, for me is consider going on offense and Selling Options going on defense.*

&#x200B;

So we are going to focus on the buying options first since that's what most traders start off with and I might make a selling options post at later date.

&#x200B;

So to start with the basic assessment question:

1. What am I willing to lose?
2. . This can be tricky, causing new traders to abusively diamond hands their options/shares and baghold. Raise your hand if this is you. So we must ask a more detailed question:
   1. **How much am I willing to lose, so that my lost doesn't wipe out my monthly/ YTD profits?**
3. By asking this specific question, it lead me in a **performance based mindset.** I wanted realized profits on a weekly and month basis. NOT unrealized( when you don't sell). This gave me the space to think about the chances of  making back those profits, if I lost the money in one or few bad trades. So I narrowed it down to these percentages.
4. Calls or Call Debits Spreads - 10% or less of Portfolio value (graph below)
   1. It seems risking to losing 10% of PV to make 20-50% gain on trade is a good mix
   2. Some plays overtime might zoom pass your price targets and you might just let some run, just remember to take profits because you need your portfolio to grow and not get stuck with a lucky win.
   3. As the Portfolio grow in value due to great trades, inject new capital, long position growing, you will start to use less capital for calls/puts/debit spreads.
   4. New trader make a mistake and risk it all and then have to wait **MONTHS to restart or they just give up and blame stock market sucks.** You might also here, **it works until it doesn't** lol.  Thus being stuck in the hamster wheel of the rat race. **Re-read this point again.** 5x Don't write yourself off too soon, especially if you haven't put in at least 1 year of trading.

&#x200B;

1. Debit Spreads for more consistent gains?
   1. Almost becomes a cheat code, because typically there is still equity in the trade as time passes, and your losses is limited. If your underlying goes against you, and there is more than 5 days to expiration you mostly can close out early or place a stop loss order to prevent further loss. With Calls and puts time decay and IV crush is a bitch..point blank period.
   2. It's best to stick with SPY, IWM, and/or QQQ but if you want to gamble with individual stocks, just know it very difficult to save the trade or escape quickly, since most of you are probably doing weeklies.
   3. With debit spreads always close out your trade yourself to **avoid assignment**

Below is the difference between Call and Call Debit Spread.

1. Both serves as a purpose of a bullish move but if the stock price is at or above the short strike price the debit spreads is also a neutral strategy 

2. The Call option, is roughly double the cost but infinite profits(this is on SPY so a rapid price movement in a day would typical not exceed more than 1-1.5% in a day. 

3. Notice how the call loses premium each day if price action stay stagnant and the debit spreads preserves capital in this scenario and as each day gets closer to expiration, the potential of profit is higher than the call but profits is limited. 

4. Below is both ATM options for call (1) and Bull Call Debit Spread (2)  on the Same expiry date. 

&#x200B;

[Call \(1\)](https://preview.redd.it/4vwz1y5aeud71.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e693b24a4de64542e2c5226d8aefa0317510b57f)

&#x200B;

[Bull call Debit Spread ](https://preview.redd.it/apxh23jceud71.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0f083cb092aadc0b5f5b130fbabbb69b13469121)

I'm not against Calls. I used them only strategically or for gambling trades on GME, AMC, SNDL, AMD due to the low premiums plus expected rise in volume at the time **where it didn't make sense to do a debit spread due to opportunity cost.**

&#x200B;

Below is a visual and potential outcome, you can look to see if you had 25 winning trades per year, hence executing more and being responsible is key. So 50 winning trades could be a goal or 25. This is just for motivation and the numbers below isn't compounding based off reinvesting the profits. Obviously as PV grows your trades will become larger if you follow some sort of guidance, like below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vptp6e1jeud71.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b486d4fd8d6baec1145bdc25f780bfa5ff1673c

You see with the small account you might be wondering..mhmm I should just put $990 in a trade and keep going..right but that will be 20% of your portfolio value meaning all it will take is 5 trades to destroy your account.

Those who built an account to $25,000 or more through trading have some experience but still may be a beginner in trading if they are only executing a few trades a year and go ""lucky"".

There is even 6 figure professionals, who start off with a large account , think they know how to trade based off their professional 1confidence and risk it all as well without having any proper risk management and business sense.

But if you feed your portfolio with new capital in the beginning, eat crow, go on defense with expenses and be a student of game putting 25 hours of homework and trading a week, then you can get your goal asap.

Pretty Simple stuff but the questions is.. **Do you really want to put in the work?**

&#x200B;

Sidenote: Highly recommend keeping a options journal. I thought I didn't need but ever since I started putting into practice it has been a game changer for honing in my risk management skill.

955,"Robinhood & Me: or How I Got Screwed ... recording with ""Highest Level Of Escalation""","Looking for help/direction here, not sure what my next step is, if there is one. Most of this is in the intro to the the video that contains the full hour long conversation I had with ""Joe"" who introduced himself as ""the highest level of escalation that you can get above a manager."" From the Robinhood IPO Roadshow I believe this to be Joe Iraci VP Enterprise Risk. Since he blocked me on Twitter ...

Morning of 6/25 woke up giddy ready to buy some AMC as I had made a deposit and thought it should be cleared. INSTEAD. Woke up with a deficit. Panicked I called my bank. Money was there, they refunded the NSF charges. Called Robinhood support, on with them for about 40 minutes. Explaining it's a bank error, how I can I fix this since now my access to ""instant deposits"" are restricted, how can I get them the money, trying to make sure that since it didn't go through is there a chance they would run it through again because then stuff would be bouncing for real. I'm told it'll be escalated.

* edit: As it seems some might have misunderstood, I didn't call making excuses or asking for more time. I was asking them how to resolve it right then and there.

As I'm anxiously awaiting, approximately 9:45 am, less than two hours later they liquidated my stocks. I couldn't breath. Support couldn't have told me, warned me? Now I'm deep red.

Monday I call support. Speak with ""Matt"" for about 30 minutes who is often referred to in the video/phone call with Joe. Matt asks me to send the copies of the NSF charges being refunded as it might help him escalate this quicker. He also stated that I should not initiate a new deposit as it could interfere with getting my ""instant deposits"" restrictions removed. Keep in mind I only care about the ""instant deposit"" feature as a means to put money in there to fix all this. I send the screen grabs. Within two hours they liquidated all of my options.

After many emails, most of which just type of blaming me, sorry this is not what you want to hear, case closed. I'd write back, would be told it's being escalated. On 6/17 I got one from Cameron and this line was the gut punch:

*""even without access to the Instant Deposit feature, if we could see you had initiated transfers that would be sufficient to cover your margin call, we would not have needed to liquidate positions while we waited to confirm those transfers landed successfully. Even though this may have taken five trading days to land, you still had the option to initiate deposits to cover the call.""*

Part of my reply:

*""FULL STOP. Caps aren’t meant to be aggressive but THIS WAS NEVER communicated to me. I was wiped out because I didn’t simply redo the deposit. You realize there were loses incurred? And all I had to do was redo a deposit despite being told that instant deposits were not available by tech support. I have contended since the beginning of this entire fiasco that what my issue was was that I was not given any way to remedy the situation, not informed by support on either liquidation that they were about to take place though they were BOTH within an hour. GO listen to the tapes. At NO TIME did anyone say “all you have to do is redo the deposit.” My entire account raped and pillaged because of the seemingly poor use of the word “instant” deposits. Your support does not know how to articulate anything other than sympathy and cant, out of the hour or more I spoke with them, when I’m begging them telling them repeatedly I HAVE THE MONEY, I HAD the money to start with. If there was any confusion that’s something support should have understood because the only recollection that I had was asking “But if I made a deposit it wont help because I don’t have instant deposit?” YES IT WOULD HAVE HELPED … APPARENTLY. ""*

My case got elevated again, this time to Sabrina on the 13th who said: *“Robinhood accounts are entirely self-directed. This means that all transactions made are the responsibility of the account holder. Given this …”*

Partial reply from me:

*""It is undeniably clear that the reason I suffered such devastating losses and endured such excruciating emotional distress is directly a result of your support directing me to do the opposite of what you and Cameron say I should have done. Your statement:*

*“Robinhood accounts are entirely self-directed. This means that all transactions made are the responsibility of the account holder. Given this,”*

*is unsupported by the facts as detailed multiple times to multiple people including yourself. I was told, in no uncertain terms, by Robinhood staff that I SHOULD NOT initiate another deposit. My actions were not self-directed, they were directed by Robinhood. This invalidates the erroneous and conclusionary “Given this.""*

More escalation till Joe. Joe, in my humble opinion, was trying the white hat approach hoping I'd say, I don't know, anything that might be used against me. But I think it did more to bolster my position than anything else. He continually goes back to this timeframe that doesn't make sense when it would have taken me ten seconds to initiate a deposit. He says ""this occurred on the 25th and you called Mike on the 28th"" ... well I actually called ON the 25th also. About Mike telling me NOT to initiate a deposit he said:

*""What he was basically referring to is that the and I don't think he communicated it well. And that's kind of why I want to kind of come to this is that if the events have already occurred. So this occurred on 25th. And when you're calling Mike, the reason why they don't initiate is because there's really no there's no remedy that situation is still deposit, the same outcome will occur.""*

But NO, my options weren't liquidated yet. He goes on:

*""So what so I think that might be and I think when we are looking at these, and especially, obviously my job is to go backwards coaching opportunities will occur. Similar representative telling you the that he could have deposited is very, very, very small windows martensitic, the other five in the morning, and trying to make a deposit. That theoretically, you could have done it. Yes. Realistically, there's a very small window, and it's very bad outcomes that we wouldn't have.""*

The way me makes this ""tiny window,"" which was actually hours on the 25th & 28th sound like they were some herculean task, as if I would have had to rob a Brinxs truck, loaded up bags upon bags of dollar bills, hoofed it over to my bank where they would have had to send it to them by pony express.

It's all bullshit and doesn't *seem* legal to me. I'm just fucked beyond in every aspect over this and at a loss how to go about doing anything about it, which is what I assume they count on. I've come to think that's why they target retail, cuz they can fuck em over easier than someone who defend themselves.

... for the record, everything above is ""allegedly."" ...

956,"Security Analysis: Chapter I: The Scope and Limitations of Security Analysis. The Concept of Intrinsic Value Pt. 3: The Examples, Continued","Part 3 of Chapter 1! First post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BurryEdge/comments/ovipxo/security_analysis_chapter_i_the_scope_and/). Second post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BurryEdge/comments/ovk6fj/security_analysis_chapter_i_the_scope_and/).

**Principal Obstacles to Success of the Analyst:**

a. *Inadequate or Incorrect Data.* Fairly self-explanatory. If you have bad data, your success is hindered. Data can be falsified despite the increasing calls for regulation, something as true back then as it is in 2021. Be skeptical of everything presented to you by either a company or a historical record. Sometimes concealment is inevitable, and in these cases, an incorrect judgement can be made.

b. *Uncertainties of the Future*. Even if your analysis is correct, the future brings with it a quantifiable measure of uncertainty which can dilute the efficacy of your initial analysis. Keep this in mind as you are on your investment journey.

c. *The Irrational Behavior of the Market*. Ah, the old adage we all know and hate. *The market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent*. The authors mention that you can combat this by purchasing liquid securities and also by positioning yourself to be able to stay patient for long periods of time, if necessary.

**The Hazard of Tardy Adjustment of Price Value:**

Over the course of a period of time that you are holding a security with the intention that the price will reflect the intrinsic value you have determined, you MUST be weary of the fact that a catalyst could suddenly occur which completely changes the intrinsic value of the security, for better or for worse. The analyst can protect themselves by finding situations which are not subject to sudden change by favoring securities where the popular interest promises a swift response to changes in value. This can be accomplished by finding undervalued securities under *normal market conditions* (our current market would not be considered normal by the author's standards), and by staying cautious in times of abnormal stress and uncertainty.

**The Relationship of Intrinsic Value to Market Price:**

Note here, an investment has both speculative and investment properties. The speculative side is more prone to needing critical judgements by the analyst to determine properly. Any one of these factors can have an overwhelming effect on the market price and can supersede the other factors listed.

Here, we are given both a useful chart and an acute analogy. The authors have identified in this chart that since the speculative factors of a quoted market price are actually in direct conflict with, and yet work with, the ""cold, hard"" analytical factors which reflect the security's actual value, we see that the market is not a \*weighing machine (\*implying reliance on the factual evidence behind the security's value) ***but rather*** *a voting machine* (implying that the market actually works more like a popularity contest rather than anything logical).

**ANALYSIS AND SPECULATION**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here, the authors make an argument against using analysis in scenarios where substantial uncertainty and risk is present due to over speculation. They make 2 arguments against purchasing securities here:

1. In cases where speculation is present, the cost of entering a position may outweigh the potential gains found in the position. This is especially true in scenarios where the bid-ask spread is high, or where a large volume of trading causes huge price swings.
2. Speculative situations, where risk is unnecessarily high, intrinsic value can change before the analyst has time to identify the changes. Insiders may have an informational advantage here which analysts will never be privy to.

**The Value of Analysis Diminishes as the Element of Chance Increases.**

This part seems to be a general disclaimer by the authors and can be summarized quite simply. If you find yourself in a scenario where chance or luck will end up being the final determining factor in your success, then analysis should be more of an *adjunct* or *auxiliary* than a *guide* to your speculation. The rest of this section, in my opinion, is very subjective to the reader, and is determinate on what your idea of speculation or analysis may be.

To bring it to the present, I have 2 examples in mind: First, the meme stock frenzy. Here, analysis may provide some clues as to the value of the underlying, but with the large volume of speculation by retail traders, and with the resultant change in the underlying fundamentals of the companies as a result of this frenzy, analysis proves ill-suited to providing an analyst with an idea of the intrinsic value of the companies (GME and AMC are great examples in particular, here). The authors would therefore advice the analyst to exercise caution or avoid these scenarios entirely, something which takes great psychological fortitude, especially in times of excess.

Thanks for reading everyone! Chapter 2 will be up next week!

957,How Stocks Are Valued Part 2: Relative Value,"In my last post, I went over how to value stocks based on the discounted cash flow of a company. If you haven't read it yet, [start here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) This post will go over ***relative valuation***, rather than the absolute value of a company.

# Comparables

When you're buying a house, how do you determine what the fair value of the house is? Appraisers often look at similar homes in the neighborhood to get an idea of how much the house should be worth.

If the house on 123 Potato Street were similar to all the other houses on Potato Street but was selling for 20% more than the average, odds are it's not going to sell. This concept of comparing assets to similar assets also applies in stock valuation.

# How Do We Compare Stocks?

Remember that stocks just represent a fraction of a company's future earnings. For similar companies with similar industries, earnings, and, $1 in earnings for company A should be worth the same as $1 of earnings for company B.

A lemonade stand that makes $10 on Potato Street should be worth about the same to an investor as a lemonade stand that makes $10 somewhere else in the same neighborhood. If one is valued at $100 and the other at $120, the first lemonade stand might be undervalued.

There are several metrics we can use to compare stocks. Some ratios include:

1. Price to Earnings (P/E). This ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share. For example, WFC and BAC are (at a glance) similar companies since they're both in the same industry. It makes sense that they have similar P/E ratios, with WFC at 13.16 and BAC at 12.83. However, we see that BAC is relatively cheaper as we pay less for each dollar of earnings compared to WFC.
2. The Enterprise Multiple (EV/EBITDA). This ratio measures the enterprise value (market cap + debt - cash) compared to a company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This is an alternative to the P/E ratio but takes into consideration more than just equity holders, and adjust for capital structure, taxes, etc.
3. Price to Earnings Growth (PEG). This ratio measures the stock price as a ratio to the company's earnings growth (typically over the next 1-3 years). This ratio is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. For example, if AAPL has a P/E of 28.3x and a growth rate of 1.3%, AAPL has a PEG of 22.6x. MSFT has a higher P/E (35.09x), but because of its higher growth rate of 8.9%, has a much lower PEG of 3.92x.

We can use these ratios (and others) to identify whether stocks are relatively undervalued compared to other similar stocks, or we can compare stocks to the industry average. If we buy companies that are relatively cheaper compared to their peers, we should (in theory) perform better over time.

# Short Term Relative Value Trading Strategies

We can also make relative value trades in the short term.

A common retail trader’s strategy is to buy a stock for a few days or a few weeks, hoping to scalp a few dollars and turn a profit. However, what if the market drops? Your stock could outperform the market by only falling 3% while the market falls by 10%. You were right but you still lost money due to your market exposure.

Hedge funds also bet on stocks, except instead of looking for a return on a single stock, they bet on stocks going up or down relative to another. They buy stock A and short-sell stock B, hoping A will outperform B. This is aptly named the Long-Short trading strategy or the pairs trade. If A falls 3% but B drops 5%, the hedge fund makes money overall.

# Short Term Relative Value Trade Examples

How can we apply this to our trading? What if we think GME will outperform AMC? At $161 its may or may not be a good idea to be strictly long GME. However, we can hedge by shorting AMC. If all meme stocks crash, we still make money as long as GME doesn’t fall as much as AMC does. If GameStop stays flat, we make money when AMC falls. (Of course, if you think AMC is the winner you can just inverse the above strategy)

We can apply this strategy to stocks in similar industries such as GM/Ford, Visa/Mastercard, and Coke/Pepsi.

A second example would be a pairs trade I closed earlier last week.

Google has two classes of (publicly traded) shares: GOOGL (Class A) which has voting rights, and GOOG (Class C) which has none.

Theoretically, GOOGL should always be more expensive because they have voting rights, but because Alphabet is conducting share buybacks of GOOG exclusively, GOOGL was cheaper for a while - [We can see this in the trading view chart here.](https://imgur.com/a/Qng5vyG)

By buying GOOGL and shorting GOOG, I’m betting the gap between the two stocks will close. I don’t care if the market rises, falls, or goes sideways. I don’t even care if google falls 50%. The only thing I’m betting on is that GOOGL will be the same price as GOOG eventually, and after Alphabet announced it would start buybacks of both share classes, the gap closed.",2021-08-01 11:52:03

[MM Income Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/17it6izwv6f71.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=caf1bdfc48ac6484af6c0430e1de927609bb58f2)

Virtu generated $801M in MM revenue and paid only $223M for the order-flow to the brokerages, ex. Robinhood. This is a **gross margin** of **72.2%** on the MM business. That means for every $1 VIRT pays to a brokerage, they are able to make $3.59, or $2.59 in profits! Not to mention this profitability scales as Robinhood and other brokerages grow meanwhile, VIRT doesn’t have to pay a penny for the customer acquisition costs! 

This is one reason why Virtu had a revenue of $1,073M last quarter, HOOD only had a revenue of $522M. While Virtu has 2x HOOD’s revenue, has a more profitable business, and has less expense to grow revenue/customer base, HOOD’s MC is \~$38B to VIRT’s \~$5B. 

Virtu’s P/E is always fluctuating as market volume is the key indicator to VIRT’s revenue but I believe we have entered a new market trend where active management is here to stay. New traders and investors are obsessed with the markets and love to buy and sell positions with a much shorter holding period than historically. This may be due to the gamification of trading apps, or a plethora of other reasons but all that matters is the trend of average volume increasing across the broader market. 

Jumping back, you may have noticed the spotty revenue figures seen in Q3 and Q4 2020, why is this? Well Q1 and Q2 of 2020 had very high volumes due to the Covid-19 crash and following rebound. This is another great reason to own the stock, let me explain. VIRT literally makes way more money when the market crashes because volumes spike during the panic. That means VIRT is not correlated to the overall market and actually has a %-year Beta of -0.29.

&#x200B;

[5-Year Beta](https://preview.redd.it/w0me61xyv6f71.png?width=431&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=02c01c4889c0c430754f203fe92e3c24c90823dc)

When the market crashes, VIRT benefits therefore the shares can be sold, and used to buy other companies at very cheap valuations! 

**Short Term Thesis:**

During Q1 2021 meme-stocks were all over the news. Gamestop made incels and plebs into multi-millionaires which drew in mass amounts of volume into the markets chasing similar returns. Due to this unexpected volume VIRT EPS beat by 63% (Actual: $2.04 vs Expected: $1.25). This meme-stock craze has continued in Q2 2020 with AMC, CLOV, BB, SPCE, just to name a few. (Just pull up the charts and look at June volumes, too many charts to attach) 

Personally, I expect EPS to be below Q1 as total market volumes decreased by approx 25%  Q2 2021 than Q1 2021, as seen below. 

&#x200B;

[2021 Q2 Volume ](https://preview.redd.it/xjio2se0w6f71.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=71e71cd826d206bfc991d7e2802e7a94c33200ca)

&#x200B;

However, I still believe VIRT will easily beat the expected EPS of $0.81. 

**Q2 2021 earnings call is Before Market Open tomorrow Aug 4th, 2021.**

&#x200B;

**Share Repurchases:**

Virtu Financial has been aggressively buying back shares as they are currently trading at a ttm P/E of 4.91. (Not using Forward P/E cause earnings estimates have been proven to be inaccurate) Virtu started repurchasing shares in Q4 2020 purchasing 1.4M shares (0.7% of float), 2.3M shares in Q1 2021 (1.2% of float), and 1.6M shares in first 2-months of Q2 2021 (0.8% of float). 

Since the last earnings on May 4th, 2021 the share price traded from \~$28/share upto $32/share and has recently fallen to $25/share allowing for buyback to continue at these low levels.

&#x200B;

**Technicals:**

1. Daily RSI is currently at 37.
2. MACD has reversed and is forming a bullish pattern.
3. Share price is pushing up against the 20-day SMA.
4. August 20th (and others) options are merely 40% IV pricing in a very low expected move.

&#x200B;

**Concerns:**

* SEC is investigating payment-for-order-flow, which is key to this business.

Counter: CEO of Virtu has been on many media calls where he explains that as an MM they are actually creating price improvement on market-orders which would actually be executed at higher prices if they didn’t exist as an MM. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q474x33a25w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q474x33a25w) (start at 3:00 for price improvement discussion)

&#x200B;

* As re-opening continues, new traders will have less time to focus on active management.

Counter: Human nature makes habits very difficult to break. 

&#x200B;

* Market-making is so profitable currently that competition will eat away profitability.

Counter: Existing relationships with brokerages.

**TLDR:** Meme stocks have continued into Q2 2021 with high volumes. Virtu Financial **(VIRT)** is an MM-firm which benefits from high-volumes, and growth of active investing without customer acquisition costs. VIRT has recently fallen due to a SEC investigation which lacks any evidence of wrong-doing to retail investors. Share repurchases are accelerating. Option chain is very mispriced, IV \~40%.",2021-08-03 14:52:32

### In the News

Robinhood (HOOD) options were listed on Wednesday and the stock joined the ranks of the meme stocks, at least for a few days. The highest strike originally listed was $70, and initially, there were only monthly expiries. As we’ve seen in other meme stocks, the highest call strike becomes popular in retail, and $70 was where the stock closed on Wednesday as short gamma ran out above that level. The stock finished the week at $55. Weekly options and higher strikes have now been added (as high as $170). The $70 strike, August 20th remains the strike with the most open interest as of now.

Skew to the upside is sharp, with the 55 calls expiring this week around 155 IV, while the 75 calls are around 205 IV. Translation, positions that buy nearer to the money and spread by selling OTM are favorable cost/skew. The expected move for this week is about 15%:

What’s poppin’ bull gang, Flux here with your weekly Historical Post Earnings Moves spreadsheet! We’ve got meme week this week, so expect extra volatility alongside some absolutely stupid price action. I hope you all managed to close some profits last week during the chop. **$FSLY strangles returned 60% while binary options would’ve done around 300%. $ROKU strangles more or less broke even. $UBER and $LYFT both moved in tandem resulting in solid returns for most collateral plays.** I personally played $NKLA (even though I said not to) and lost 19$, while also getting punished by $SMG and losing a small chunk of premium. Managed to close out the week at roughly breakeven, which is honestly a blessing.  Will need to re-evaluate my plan going into this week! That being said, I want you all to be careful. Meme week is often not worth trading, and it may be wise to play the sell side if you’re really looking to scratch the itch. Similar to last week, if you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let’s get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlrHfP2gEKvQCGAH82WE0geh5jD689U4aNOMuwIwPlg/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **$APPS has very expensive options.** Options are pricing in a 14% move, yet Digital Turbine only moves 8% historically. We can abuse this by selling a straddle or strangle and raking in those juicy premiums! The same holds true for $BIDU. Options are pricing in nearly 6%, while historically we get a move of around 2%. In this case, I would be a little more conservative when playing $BIDU, since it’s a Chinese stock, and we all saw how those fared earlier this month. Regardless, the premiums are there should we choose to play.

&nbsp;

- **Sample sizes are small this week. This is both a blessing and a curse.** Many companies who report have only recently gone public, meaning we don’t have our standard 20+ data points to draw conclusions from. For companies with less than a year of ERs under their belts, I wouldn’t look to the historical moves as a reliable metric. That being said, this leads to opportunity. Because some of these companies are so young, it’s going to be extremely hard for market makers to price their options efficiently and put a price tag on each companies potential “growth”. What is a good metric of growth and guidance for Coinbase? What about AirBnB? Literally nobody knows, meaning there’s the potential to make some money due to pricing inefficiencies.

&nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There’s no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see insane moves. We even got a sneak preview of this last week with $CLNE where we literally closed flat post earnings. Options prices are jacked up, and you’re just going to get robbed by theta gang if you go long. The best way to trade these tickers would be on the sell side, with OTM credit spreads or strangles. The premiums are extremely nice, and the moves will likely be weak. Keep in mind, this is just a guess, so there’s a chance I’m entirely wrong and get blown out, but I really feel like meme season is over, at least for now. MMs are going to be laughing all the way to the bank with these ones.

&nbsp;

All that being said, this week is shaping up to be awkward, so I’ll likely look to pull the trigger on some plays at the very last minute. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

Meme week up ahead! It’s probably best to sit this week out as it’s extremely difficult to trade with such a limited set of data and such a volatile pool of companies. If you really need to make some plays, look to prioritize the sell side, as those will give us the best risk to reward on our trades. If you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlrHfP2gEKvQCGAH82WE0geh5jD689U4aNOMuwIwPlg/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

965,AMC Entertainment Q2 earnings – What to expect,"**Earnings –** Loss of $0.91 per share expected  
**Revenue –** $341.3 million expected

One of the most famous meme stocks, AMC Entertainment Holdings  (AMC) has been grabbing the headlines since the Covid-19 pandemic. The  American movie theatre chain will announce its second-quarter results on  August 9, after the market close. 

A darling among the  speculative retail traders, AMC is considered a meme stock primarily  because its popularity drives its price on web forums (WallStreetBets,  Reddit, Twitter) than by business fundamentals. Analysts and trading  punks hence are having a hard time anticipating the share price movement  as it can fluctuate wildly, regardless of its financial performance.

In the last two years, AMC has acquired Carmike Cinemas, Odeon Cinemas  and Nordic Cinema. As of March 2021, it operated approximately 1000  theatres and **10,700** screens in the United States and internationally.

Edit: Post icon was made the dominican flag due to reddit auto-filling the photo from the first linked article (and now I can not remove it). That flag has nothing to do with this post or the exchange. 

Start with Coinbase and **add margin, leverage, options and futures**. Then take the DeFi exchanges and make the interface **accessible for beginner DeFi users** in addition to adding know your customer and anti-money laundering regulations **(KYC/AML) which will allow large institutions to invest in DeFi**.  The result is Bullish, which combines crypto exchanges like Coinbase  and Binance with DeFi exchanges like Uniswap and Sushiswap.

## Bullish Features

1. Provides **options, futures, leverage and margin** on cryptocurrency. While some limited crypto option trading is available outside the US, **Bullish will offer these features on an SEC-compliant exchange.**
2. Allows **automated portfolio management** for liquidity pool providers (maintaining certain percentages of each asset) as well as passive income from margin lending and through transaction fees.
3. Maintains **vertical integration (i.e. works as its own clearinghouse)**. In  other words, no risk of trouble like Robinhood had in Jan 2021 in  regard to GME/AMC stock pauses, purportedly due to clearinghouse  regulations.
4. Brings DeFi transaction costs closer to the lower costs of crypto fees. Additionally, of interest to retail crypto traders, **no taker fees regardless of trade volume** (compared to Coinbase’s 0.5% fee for trades under 10k, and 0.25% fee for trades 50-100k).

**Additional Information:**

5. Cryptocurrency exchange revenue from all exchanges in 2021 is estimated at 70B.

6.  Bullish maintains their own treasury (164000 BTC and 2M EOS) in  additional to $400M from investors (currently worth about 7B in total).

7.  Seeing as Bullish is co-founded by former NYSE chair Tom Farley, the  exchange will likely know what is needed to court large investors  towards DeFi, particularly in regard to meeting the requirements needed  for counterparty risk management as well as liquidity pool optimization.

## Investing in Bullish

&#x200B;

[FPAC in June, July, August](https://preview.redd.it/zjkwedn9bdg71.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1fa965e3a600e6137371e49ca57e899c468dcef7)

\- FPAC in the past week has had low volumes in the  2-300,000 daily range. Only 3 days of trading in the past month had  volumes greater than 1M (July 9th reached 19M, which occurred when the  merger was written about in Reuters and Bloomberg, among others).  (Average 3mo volume is 750K/day.) By comparison, **Coinbase,  priced around $250, has daily volumes around 4M, while other well-know  spac mergers such as CCIV to Lucid still have daily volumes around 8M.** (Recall 6 months ago CCIV went from $10 to 60 over 6 weeks with daily volumes of 20-120M). In other words, **when interest picks up, especially if BTC continues rebounding, there is great growth possible.**

&#x200B;

[Volume level in the past few weeks](https://preview.redd.it/sbsp3bhcbdg71.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cb12a555ad16f2cf9d01795c4db6aeb3f5423bd)

\- **No analyst reports are written yet.** Aside from the  few articles on July 9 when the merger was annouced, and one later  follow up article about SoftBank investment, Bullish has generally not  been covered.

\- Option chain goes up to $20 and all the way out to March 2022.

\- Private pilot ends in 5 weeks.

\- With BTC seeming to start rebounding entering autumn 2021, Bullish hopefully will have fortuitous timing for going public.

\- Of course, I have invested in Bullish but, in addition to reading this report, do your own research.

969,Pre-market news- August 10th 2021,"U.S. stock futures struggled for direction Tuesday as investors awaited clues from Federal Reserve officials about plans to ease stimulus measures. Futures tied to the S&P 500 inched up less than 0.1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures wavered between small gains and losses. On Monday, both indexes edged lower amid unease about the state of the economic recovery. Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.1% Tuesday.

In out-of-hours trading, AMC Entertainment Holdings rose almost 9% after one of the original meme stocks said Monday it was planning changes to its theaters that are aimed at appealing to its loyal following of Reddit investors, including accepting bitcoin. Clover Health, another meme stock popular with Reddit-based investors, rose 5%.

SmileDirectClub slumped over 15% in off-hours trading. The direct-to-consumer teeth-straightening business said Monday that quarterly revenue fell short of its expectations after taking a heavy hit from an April cyberattack.

Moderna gained 2% premarket. The biotech company’s shares had already jumped 17% Monday after two reports showed that its Covid-19 vaccine was more effective against the Delta variant than a rival shot made by Pfizer and BioNTech.

In commodity markets, oil prices recovered somewhat after slumping Monday on fears that the spreading Delta variant would weigh on demand. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 1.3% to $69.92 a barrel. Gold prices gained 0.6%.

Earnings are expected Tuesday morning from Casper Sleep, Aramark, Sysco and Eastman Kodak. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global and software company McAfee are set to release earnings after markets close.

Separate speeches from the Fed’s Loretta Mester and Charles Evans later Tuesday will be closely parsed by investors for clues on when the officials expect the central bank to begin tapering its economic support.

“We are going to see the Fed continuing to nudge us and remind us that they are eventually going to taper,” said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. “There has been enough telegraphing about tapering that it is unlikely to cause a tantrum so I wouldn’t hold my breath or hide under my desk when that announcement is made.”

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Consumer Defensive was the leading sector yesterday. Farm Products, Solar, and Gambling were the top 3 leading industries. Despite the slow grinding in the main indices, the trading action intraday was nice and for the most part bullish. 

SPY is neutral pre-market and QQQ is slightly gapping up. Both indices are above all moving averages. Chinese stocks are moving higher pre market, many are trying to break back over their short term moving averages. Auto manufacturer stocks are also trying to move higher, many are sitting on major moving averages such as the 50 and 200.  Trading remains fairly slow but will most likely pick up next month when the summer is over. Business as usual for active day traders.  If you are new, take it easy, observe, don't get in a hurry and most important of all, learn how to manage risk. Good luck trading.

974,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, August 10, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 10, 2021**

Choppiness in the market continued, with stocks closing the day mixed, with the tech- heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) powered to new, intraday record highs, driven by strength in financial and industrial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, traded mostly even, closing the day 0.22% higher. Like I have been saying for weeks now, while I remain bullish I expect a lot of choppiness in the market moving forward. In my view, there are a variety of contending factors affecting the market, including but not limited to: (1) record corporate earnings, (2) Senate’s passage of the infrastructure bill, (3) improving labor market, (4) rising concerns surrounding the delta variant, (5) concerns around inflation, (6) regulatory concerns in China.

Today, the price of oil rebounded from a three week low, with the market hoping that the resilient demand from the West may offset weak demand from China. Yesterday, oil prices tumbled due to concerns that the latest outbreak of COVID in China would trigger a swift response from the government, which has been so far extremely aggressive in battling the virus. China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 146 new infections as of Monday - the fourth straight day it reported 90 cases and above and the second day it has reported over 100 cases. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. 

While those numbers are very small compared to the US, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called “zero-COVID” approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is possible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, the CCP has ordered mass testing in areas of high transmission, re-implemented extensive lockdowns, enacted new travel restrictions within the country, and extended the closure of its borders to foreign travelers. As of yesterday, at least 47 officials have been punished for “negligence”, according to state reports. 

Shockingly, we actually have some good news coming out of Congress. The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. 

**Highlights**

* The 2020 Olympics concluded and were a wild disappointment, with ratings experiencing a 42% decline compared to the 2016 Olympics. 
* Wild ride in AMC today. Shares gapped up more than 10% premarket before falling throughout the session to close the day -6% down, a 16% intraday swing. 
* According to a new report by the Department of Labor, worker productivity grew at a slower-than-expected pace in Q2. Nonfarm productivity grew at a 2.3% annualized rate, down from 4.3% pace in Q1
* Pepsi (PEP) partnered with Boston Beer (SAM) to produce an alcoholic rendition of the popular soda Mountain Dew. Product expected to be on the shelves by early 2022
* DraftKings (DKNG) announced a content partnership with Autograph, an NFT company founded by NFL superstar Tom Brady. Matt Kalish, DKNG President said, “Autograph’s Advisory Board includes some of the most iconic athletes ever and we could not imagine a more fitting figure than Tom Brady to headline our first ever NFT drop on DraftKings Marketplace.” A lot of activity has been coming from DKNG recently. 
* Tesla sold 32,968 China-made cars, including those for export, according tyo the China Passenger Car Association. 
* Upstart (UPST), one of my fav fin-tech stocks that I’ve been holding for a while popped off after earnings, up more than 15%. I’m very happy about that :)
* Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said he is “trying to build the most forward-thinking sports gambling company”. This comes on the backs of Penn’s (who owns 36% of Barstool) acquired Score Media, the leading sports content app in Canada and third largest in the US. I think this is a very interesting partnership between all companies.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\*\***
* Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $205 to $210 at Overweight. Stock currently around $170

975,For People new to Crypto - an invitation to tonight's event {$PYE} {DEVTEAM6} {DMoney},"  

time of uncertainty many will grasp for comfort. Comfort manifests itself in many ways for people concerned with wealth or the well-being of their family or loved ones. Unfortunately, the ability to procure comfort has become a bit more of a challenge in traditional processes and in some ways easier for those that offer alternative methodology for earning… 

Once upon a time we understood that the largest sums of wealth came from hard work and physical labor as well as manufacturing a product or service that created a demand. This system was tangible; with clearly defined methods to create success. If you had a work-ethic, the ability to sell your innovation and deliver the supply to equal the demand you could protect yourself from the side-effects of poverty or the ever-impending sense of fear of loss. 

Some of these principals remain today although the work-ethic and product/service definition has ran itself over, poured gasoline on itself, lit the fire, jumped off a cliff and was impaled by 6 foot steel spikes; then the car fell on top… BOOM!! DEAD!

Creating a product today can be as simple as making one silly video that goes viral or drawing a face on a pebble and calling it a “pet-rock.” As silly as this sounds, this is what the bulk of our younger generation is relying on to establish comfort; which is perfectly okay if you can take advantage of it… Want to know how?

This is how:

Cryptography is the next revolution. Period. Many of us are unfamiliar with it and when someone utters the phrase “Blockchain technology” our eyes glaze over, our attention deficit disorder kicks in we stare off into space whilst the pimply nerdy-kid in front of us tries his/her best to use layman’s terms (we still don’t and never will understand) to explain it to us. – This is how it feels, am I right? The best part is… You don’t have to understand it. You just have to dip your toe into the water and see for yourself; and you can’t believe how easy and lucrative it can be.

Without attempting to explain any of the unnecessary technical stuff I will tell you why it is a smart play to invest in Crypto… The stock market can be manipulated; as we have seen this year (Gamestop and AMC) and people know this. The potential to earn can be great but is limited; limited to factual earnings and import/export restrictions as well as lobbying and the idea that many facets of government play significant roles in progress or decline. Crypto can be a challenge as of late but only because the market has become inundated with fakes, scams and rug-pulls (crashes). 

The two most important aspects of knowing where to invest is stability and transparency within the development team. If you’ve heard of Bitcoin, there’s a reason, same premise with now Dogecoin and Etherium as well as XRP and Cardano (ADA). If it sounds like I’m speaking a foreign language right now than you are in the right place. These coins have a future… You can speak to a developer team; you can find the currency online and you can purchase or exchange products using their technology. These are the Blue-chips of Crypto. A less-volatile investment in a highly volatile world. An investment here is intelligent and will absolutely yield a return in the future. But there’s one more coin that you should be aware of. A product with more Stability and transparency than we have seen before in a Crypto technology. 

I assume you are now thinking, “here comes the sales pitch” and the “please subscribe to my page to learn more;” but that’s not what is happening here… The coin is PYE. The developer team is known as Dev team 6 and they are based in Arizona US. The CEO is a successful business developer and has contacts that the aforementioned coins only wished they had. This is real; this is the opportunity we passed up when people began spreading the word about Bitcoin and now each Coin is worth more than $40,000. 

Ill stop now, although I’d love to share more about the company and what is on the Horizon but I know that people are more apt to believe it if they hear it straight from the team. There is an AMA (live meeting with the team tonight) and viewers can engage the team and see the most current news. Please take a moment to tune in…

I and many other’s are here to help elaborate on questions but don’t overthink it… I encourage people to only invest expendable income If they decide to. Whatever you would spend on a night out, a date night or expensive dinner at home; eat some grilled cheese and take a chance on your piece of the new method of creating comfort. Join the young generation and reap the benefits of a new industry and no hard-work to make money.

You’ll be glad you did… 

Always make sure to do your own research and be careful taking advice from strangers; but scared money doesn’t make money, so go take a chance on PYE.

The links below will get you to tonight’s public conversation with the developer team and also the website for more information or how to jump in with the rest of us.

Thank you for taking the time to read…

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would’ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn’t much of an edge to be gained this time round.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don’t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn’t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It’s literally all just gambling, and as a result I’m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I’ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.

&nbsp;

- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we’re going up.

&nbsp;

- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you’re poor or want a binary directional play, I’d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we’re probably gonna do the classic “dump after earnings regardless of the outcome“ thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.

&nbsp;

All that being said, there aren’t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I’ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

All in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there’s little edge to be gained among those that aren’t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-08-15 14:23:43

979,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 16, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 16, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) remarkably recovering losses early in the session to narrowly eke out a new intraday record high despite massive geopolitical concerns and disappointing economic data coming out of China. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered to finish roughly even while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, was down 0.75% at the time of writing.

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists.

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

In other, very, very sad news, disorder in Afghanistan further weighed on global markets, with chaos erupting in the capital city of Kabul the last few days as civilians tried to flee the country being swiftly overtaken by the Taliban. Amid the pullback of US forces after more than twenty years of being in the country, the Taliban have regained control of the country with terrifying, ruthless swiftness. As of today, the President of Afghanistan fled the country and the Taliban is in the process of forming a new government. This is devastating news and breaks my heart to see.

In more unfortunate news, the number of children hospitalized in the US with COVID-19 has reached a new record of 1902 across the country as of Saturday. According to Reuters, children now compromise 2.4% of all coronavirus hospitalizations as the surge brought on by the delta variant continues. Moreover, according to Reuters, the number of COVID-19 patients aged 18 to 29, 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 also reached record level highs last week.

The U.S. now has an average of about 129,000 new COVID-19 cases per day, a rate that has doubled in a little over two weeks, the number of hospitalized is at a six month high, and roughly 600 people are dying each day, double the death rate seen in late July.

However, while this is definitely not good, it is important to mention that cases remain highly concentrated in areas of high vaccine hesitancy. According to John Hopkins University, almost ⅓ of all COVID hospitalizations in the US are in Texas or Florida.

According to data analysis by the Associated Press using data through May 2021, shows that 98.9% of those hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated (only 1,200 of 107,000 hospitalizations as of May 2021). Dr. Rochelle Wolensky, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said “There is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”

A fifth of the nation's COVID-19 hospitalizations are in Florida, where the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients hit a record 16,100 on Saturday, according to a Reuters tally. More than 90% of the state's intensive care beds are filled, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.

As of Friday, 91% of companies in the SPY have reported Q2 earnings, with 87% of these topping consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “In an earnings season with many surprises – including the highest frequency of EPS \[earnings per share\] beats in our 22-year data history – one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470”

**Highlights**

* In the past month or so, financial, material, industrial, and healthcare stocks have been the outperformers in the SPY while the rally in tech stocks has cooled down.
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell after regulators from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it opened a formal safety investigation into Tesla’s autopilot system. NHTSA says it has identified 11 crashes since January 2018 in which Tesla models ""have encountered first responder scenes and subsequently struck one or more vehicles involved with those scenes.""
* Bluesky, an organization funded by Twitter (TWTR) to build technology aimed at fundamentally changing how social media platforms operate, announced Jay Graber, a founder of a social events startup and digital currency developer, to lead the project.
* Movie “Free Guy” grossed $28.4 million in the US during its opening weekend, higher than the $15-17 million expected. Unlike other movies, this one was not released on stream simultaneously and is a theater exclusive for the next 6 weeks. AMC stock responded positively to this.

980,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 16, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 16, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) remarkably recovering losses early in the session to narrowly eke out a new intraday record high despite massive geopolitical concerns and disappointing economic data coming out of China. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered to finish roughly even while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, was down 0.75% at the time of writing.

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. 

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

Most are not around anymore.  Some still are. TXN for example, hit \~$99 in 2000 and didn't see that again until 2017.  CSCO $82 high in 2000, that is still the ATH.  NOK 62.5, same story.  Dell has gone private and re-public since then.

My lesson learned, you can bet on Fidel Castro, but most revolutions fail.  Bet on the dictator.  In finance, that means bet on google, amzn, SPY/VTI.  Let DDD/SSYS go...

986,So I'm gradually becoming a boomer investor.,"All year for about 13 months now I've  been heavy on growth. I've come close to my position nearly doubling in value, and then lost all my profits in February. Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.

I have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.


I recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. 

I'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. 

I sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)

I made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.


Just wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.


I am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.


My advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.


Love to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..

BTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well. If this takes place.",2021-08-19 14:49:54
987,"I have 8 months to become a full-time trader, how do I do it?","# Got into stocks in Dec 2020 and have fell in love since, it's consumed me. I have more money than I've had in my life thanks to AMC. I have a good foundation of knowledge to build off of, but in no means do I consider myself proficient in fundamental/technical analysis.

I have 8 months until I get out of the military and from there I want to hit the gates running, being a full time trader. I will primarily do scalping/swing trading. I also want to learn how to use Unusual Whales flow chart & play options using it.

So, my question is, what should I do to become the best trader I can be over the next 8 months?

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Last week Utilities was the leading sector. The top 3 leading industries for the week were Department Stores, Grocery Stores, and Health Care Plans. We had a nice dip in the markets which were bought up quickly, once again showing strength and failing to give a decent pull back longer than a couple days. Overall the intraday action was great with the added volatility. 

Pre-market all major indices are gapping up and many stocks are gapping up with them. Plenty of small caps are gapping up and very few mid caps with good charts My initial scan pulled 114 gaps that fit my criteria. I just ran another scan and pulled 165. Big gap days and days where there are lots of stocks gapping up or down can be a bit more difficult to trade. I will be focused on the best daily charts and preferably stocks with catalyst Since there are not any good earnings charts, I will be paying attention to stocks that have recently reported in the past couple weeks and are now reacting. Good luck trading.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Energy was the leading sector yesterday. Silver, Coal, and Aluminum were the leading industries. The gap up in the market held and we are back to all time highs just like that. Trading action was very bullish. 

The SPY and QQQ are both gapping up pre-market. Plenty of gap ups again, not many gap downs. Chinese stocks are moving higher after being oversold for quite some time now. The market is up 3 strong days in a row, I will be vigilant as there may be some profit taking and will be prepared to trade in either direction. Good luck trading!

992,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, August 24, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 24, 2021**

Stocks continued their strong performance, recovering from jitteriness last week to reach new intraday record highs in the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ). The Dow Jones (DIA) traded modestly even and remains roughly $2 from its record high. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued rallying after steeply underperforming last week, climbing roughly 3% in the last two days. After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give his annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.

This earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. 

Keith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist at Truist Financial, gave this take about earnings, “We think the primary trend is higher. We’re only about one year into this economic expansion. Expansions typically last about five years, And the earnings season which we just got out of was phenomenal. Even if it’s peak growth, we still think it’s going to be strong growth. You have earnings moving forward and then you look at the relative comparison of stocks relative to bonds and they’re still attractive. Overall, we think the right position is to be overweight stocks.”

US Crude oil prices gained for a second straight session, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.

Energy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Yesterday Consumer Cyclical was the leading sector. The top 3 industries are Resorts & Casinos, Gambling, and Education & Training Services. Intraday trading remains strong. This was my favorite market environment to trade when I was new to trading because it is perfect for chasing and very fast, large moves at the open. The problem with this type of intraday trading is that it often doesn't last long. 

SPY and QQQ lower/neutral pre-market after moving higher on very strong, fast moves. Now we may see some profit taking/consolidation or slow grinding action while the short term moving averages catch up. Very few gaps pre-market, many less than the past few days. Often flat markets are some of the best for intraday trading. Now that earnings season is over, there are very few earnings reports being released and we must focus on stocks trending or gapping on different types of catalysts. Good luck trading!

995,My portfolio,,2021-08-25 20:36:41
996,Reflection of a short options career.,"
A few months ago, I became excited about the realm that was stocks and investing. I saw explosion of meme stocks that was AMC and GME and couldn’t get wait to get on. I put a small amount of money into crypto and onto stocks. Then I left my investing accounts alone for a bit. 

Every month I would use DCA and buy some crypto and put a little more in stocks. My portfolio was selling coming together but it was literal pennies to what happened later. This month I would make a series of options that bought my portfolio from 300 to 3000. I was ecstatic, that was bigger than any paycheck I gotten so far. $3000 is chump changed and I planned on getting that to 30k by the end of the year. 

I didn’t see how I was slowly falling into gambling. There was no excuse. I’m didn’t understand the greeks, IV. Yes I know how stupid I am and how that sounds. I would flip a coin and bet with my greedy ass head, not understanding the fundamentals well enough nor do tying to learn it. Last week I made one bad call and got burnt hard.  I got desperate, I began revenge trading and chasing my losses rather than just moving on. 0DTE calls. Increasingly riskier positions. I would be too easily effected by my emotions and would spend hours glued on my phone, watching as my account bled red. As gamblers fallacy, I bet the last remaining of my buying power on a Hail Mary. (AMC) Yes, roast me and burn me on a stake that’s what I did. 

But it worked! I had gained 56% of my losses back, yet I wasn’t content. I wanted to wipe away all my losses and I held. Held to the point where my account got wiped out and I lost 75% of my portfolio. It’s here that realized that I was doing. I was on verge of liquidating all my stocks and withdrawing more money to gain my losses. I knew then I had to stop. 

I’m not broke, I don’t know anyone money nor do I have major financial obligations. I have my parents who support me through everything I do. I’m getting a new job next week. Why am I writing this? I guess as a reflection as my short descent into a near gambler. I’m not smarter than the market nor should one every skip the fundamentals of the market. ESPECIALLY for something like options. I had no exit strategy nor risk management. I am happy that I was able to grow my account 10x in less than a month. However 3k in the grand scheme is nothing. I’m taking this time to understand and work on my weakness. I want to hug my parents and tell them I’ll do better. I’m going to deactivate my trading account and focus on learning and building up my capital before I tamper with the market again. A painful lesson but one I felt like I needed.

997,"How many stocks do you keep in your watchlist at any given time? Do you like to have a lot, or just a few, how do you manage your list, etc?","Right now I have 43 stocks and 4 ETFs in my watchlist. I only have 6 in which I hold. I feel 43 is a lot but at the same time when going through them and trying to trim it down, I can't bring myself to get rid of almost anymore. I feel like all of them are good plays to watch, even if I've never purchased 90% of them, I still like the sectors and potential of all of them, and like to see how they do month over month. I had more than 43 recently but did decide to unfollow a few. 

My friend who also invests has like 10-11. We talk about stocks almost everyday (mainly AMC and GME, because that's all he really owns in abundance) and I feel he is missing out on a lot by following so little. He likes to concentrate on just those certain ones. There are so many opportunities out there and I just don't know how someone can follow so few. But maybe 43 is a little compared to some of you?

998,$BBIG Small Cap Squeeze Play Opportunity,"The original MOASS (Mother of all short squeezes) happened with Volkswagen in 2008. [https://www.cinemonic.com/the-biggest-short-squeeze-in-history-volkswagen-short-squeeze-of-2008/](https://www.cinemonic.com/the-biggest-short-squeeze-in-history-volkswagen-short-squeeze-of-2008/)

$GME  squeezed earlier this year when a serious of (un)fortunate events  collided to create the second biggest squeeze of all time. Then, $AMC  got in on the fun.

The latest squeeze currently in progress is $SPRT.

Where does that leave us for the latest play?

Take a look at **Vinco Ventures Inc** $BBIG.

Keep  in mind that people short stocks for a reason. Typically, it's because  the underlying fundamentals are terrible. Not going to sugarcoat it, all  the above examples had serious operational or structural problems, but  the setups were very similar - small float, high short interest and  catalysts that drive a wave of new buyers.

Focusing  on $BBIG, they've recently completed some key acquisitions that are  designed to drive growth. They also raised significant amounts of cash  so the major dilution is out of the way (dilution is a major short  squeeze killer). Many FURUs on social media are pushing $BBIG as the  next great thing which is driving retail interest and putting pressure  on shorts.

Also, the stock has  significant options activity which can cause a gamma squeeze. Therefore,  the setup is there. Will it squeeze? Who knows, but at least put this  on your radar.

What's the play? $5 Calls October or later for expiration.",2021-08-27 11:19:16
999,"Anyone here a fan of SPHD as part of a part income part growth account? And what do you think of my ""strategy""? Thoughts on my holdings?","Bought some AAPL as my first stock purchase for my new Fidelity account, as i want growth, but the divs are nice too.

Then i saw QYLD holds APPL, MSFT, AVGO, and a whole bunch of other individual stocks i wanted to get anyway, so i started putting money there. Monthly divs are a nice touch.

Then i started putting some money in O as well, since monthly divs and nice track record of said divs, so there's that too.

I'm looking at SPHD cause they hold telecom and oil / gas companies, and figure it might be a good way to branch out from bein too tech heavy if that makes any sense. And the companies are big, been around a while, don't think any of them are goin anywhere. Looking to get into other sectors as well, thought this one might be a good way. Divs are also nice.

Any thoughts good or bad on SPHD?

My ""strategy"" since i have limited cash to invest after feeding the emergency account is to just dump as much as i can into individual stocks or ETFs until i have the amount i want, then go on to the next one. Looking to get some LTC and MAIN for more monthly stuff, and really wanna get into QQQ soon for more growth.

I have a WeBull account from app shopping before i settled on Fidelity. All i have there is the free stuff they gave out for opening the account. F, ADT, GNW, and some AMC i bought. I have GME on Cash app. Up pretty good on those two but don't wanna sell yet since i ain't held em a year.

Will likely move anything not in Fidelity to them once i figure out if i can, or if i hafta hold the free stuff on the WeBull app for a certain time frame first.

Got some stablecoins that have been steadily goin up too.

Sorry that got a little rambly but those are my positions as of now. What you guys think of my ""buy one at a time till i get the amount i want"" approach with stocks / funds? Did i pick well with the QQQ, LTC, and MAIN? I think i did, but I'll ask those who know better. Any good picks for future buys as far as income you can throw out there?

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Energy was the leading sector last week. The top 3 leading industries were Gambling, Resorts & Casinos, and Aluminum. The intraday action at the beginning of the week was very strong, with stocks pumping out of the open but for the most part was great for fast moves right out of the gate but less than ideal if you don't like to chase stocks. Friday in my opinion was the best intraday action of all week and most likely because price in the main indices was closer to the short term moving averages.

Pre-market the SPY and QQQ are gapping up slightly. Many more stocks gapping up than down. IWM is finally above all it's moving averages and has broken the high of the previous short term pivot at 225. Not many earnings being released this week and should be dying down more and more each week until next earnings season. I will be concentrating on stocks in select sectors showing relative strength as well as trending stocks in key sectors with some types of catalyst for my day trading. Good luck out there.

1009,Is the FED forcing/encouraging speculation (in people's hopes of preserving value in their savings),"Hi all from London,

[I look at this graph and I think it's getting a bit scary and totally unsustainable](https://imgur.com/a/OFJrvDo).

Below is the thesis. Please tell me if I've got this wrong, and poke some holes in what I am saying. (Sorry if it sounds like a diatribe).

&#x200B;

We know about the debt cycle which corresponds to the business cycle.  The easy availability of debt in a company enables them borrow more than they would otherwise. Therefore, the debt-providers can ""create"" greater revenues on their financials which enables them to borrow more from others; and then they in turn create greater wealth, and so on, and so on. This cycle can last a while. Then, the economy can heat up due to all the extra spending exceeding production levels & GDP. The problem here is the bloating of excessive debt. The economy has been propped up for many years through stimulus packages.

Add to this, the huge increase in the money supply of a staggering 30% in the last 18 months, with modest signs of so-called ""tapering""? This must eventually materialise in inflation of all goods, wages and prices, and including stock prices. From me modest understanding of the economics of Quantitative Easing, by funnelling the dollars through banks as opposed to directly in the economy; inflation is stymied. But, that's only buying you time, right? Plus, a lot more ""ordinary"" folk are pumping money in the stock market. Everybody talks about meme stocks and crpyto. I am a member of the subreddit [Freetrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreetradeApp/) and *everything* is about GME and AMC.

In addition to the money supply, the subdued interest rates and and Treasury bond buying has created TINA -- There Is No Alternative to Stocks. Since, alternatives assets yields are so low. People stick their ""savings"" into stocks, and the price simply has to rise to match the demand.

&#x200B;

The worrying thing here is that we seem to be heading towards the Fed's never-ending ""stimulation"" and creation of a synthetic economy. People have to go on as if it's just business as usual... Since you lose money on cash, lose money on CD, lose money on treasuries, you lose money on corporate debt. Who wants to buy gold - it doesn't create any value or pay a dividend. No thanks. Crpyto is a total joke (in my humble opinion) for the same reason and will collapse when the Tether scandal is unveiled. The Fed has created an environment that the only protection people can feel they have for their wealth is in equities. It's driving everything up and people can't sit on the sidelines watching the rally (even with crazy PE ratios). The Fed has incentivised people to join the rally pretending all is well.

I think people like Cathie Wood are dangerous - they keep stoking the flames with endless panglossian talk of ""exponential growth in technology "" or the ""awakening of innovation and technological growth in the history of human civilization "" .   :/",2021-09-02 20:54:38

1011,"I don’t vent much and I never post on this app, please read and give feedback!","Im a 20yr old pre investor with a low credit score and not much money, but this doesn’t change my mindset towards the next year of my life. I have a credit card arriving in the mail this weekend and I currently hold two jobs, one of which is a sales position where I’ll soon be granted the opportunity to become a manager, and the other pays well considering I work enough for overtime. I also donate plasma weekly. All of this money is being piled into my bank account.

I began stock market investing at the beginning of this year, but I didn’t invest very smart. I went for mostly fomo stocks (GameStop, Amc, Nokia, Tilray, etc.) but I learned my lesson! I lost 50% of my portfolio in a little under 6 months. My future investment plans consist of a strategy by Warren Buffet where you study specific businesses income statements and look for durable competitive advantages (companies with a unique product or service, companies that are the low cost buyer or seller of a product, companies with a higher gross profit margin which allows them to invest their money back into their company) These company’s would be long term investments. Long term investments are statistically proven to gain more money in the long run than short term investments where people try to time the market. You’re proven to gain more money with a good company long term. This is called money compounding. Because the money you earn remains invested that means your investment is larger which means your earnings will be more the next time that stock sees a Green Day and this process will repeat continuously as long as the money sits in that stock. 

I plan to move to Florida in a couple months, I’ve heard leaving your hometown is the first step to accumulating wealth. It diverts your attention from all of the day to day bullshit that consumes your mind and shifts the attention to the more important things. It also expands your network tremendously along with your adversity. You will learn new things and meet new people leading you to generate new ideas. 

I’ve also heard that Florida is a great place to invest in real estate due to low interest rates and constant flows of tourism. I’ve considered Airbnb but I’d like to invest in a multi family due to lower Interest rates. I’ve heard it’s easy to get a loan on a multi family as well, not to mention there is possibility for greater profits if you find a good deal because you then have multiple tenants paying you rather than one. I would most likely house hack this property with an FHA loan because of the low interest rates (3.5% rather than 20%) and the ability to get the loan with a lower credit score compared to other loans. 

All profits would be reinvested (80% back into real estate and 20% into either a good long term company stock, an index fund or a Roth IRA). I plan to have hundreds of units of estate and eventually I will sell them to open a business. I haven’t quite decided what the business will be yet, time will hopefully tell. Things are changing fast and businesses might not look to the same in 15 years. It could be anything from a solar powered marijuana dispensary (or other substances depending on legality) to artificial intelligence considering how large this will be in the next few decades (that is if Tesla doesn’t completely monopolize this industry).

That’s probably enough for now but can someone please tell me if these plans, mindsets and ways of thinking sound smart or if they sound like they will get me no where. Obviously nobody knows for sure but I need someone to bounce ideas off of. Thank you :)",2021-09-05 01:56:29

1016,IRNT likely isn't done and tomorrow might be it's 06/02 (AMC),"IRNT is currently trading similar to AMC (which traded similar to GME) as it approached it's gamma squeeze. 05/27 AMC had a post market jump which led to another jump in premarket the following day (like 09/03 on IRNT although IRNT's jump is a bit exaggerated by the low float). The upward momentum wasn't held and the stock tumbled intraday creating a downward ramp pattern on 05/28 (like 09/07 on IRNT). This led a gap up (which IRNT did not mirror likely just due to market conditions) into a loose ""cup and handle"" on 06/01 (like IRNT today).

I think we all know what happened on 06/02 with AMC.

With IRNT ringing the opening bell tomorrow at the NYSE, there may be the catalyst to set off the powder keg as technicals line up with another run (double bottom rejection on $16.75) and research shows that opening bell rings on newly debuting NYSE stocks bring ""abnormal buy volume"". The first ""bullish"" day into the $20's is the exact setup needed to get through the ramp and establish the ""GME style"" launch the following day that AMC didn't have due to the share offering(s).

Not a guarantee, but it's something to watch tomorrow. I've been tracking these movements and I'm seeing the right things line up in the charts for IRNT, I wouldn't put a surprise jump out of the realm of possibility.  


Disclosure: I have 1500 37 Strike Calls and 400 17.5 Strikes, proportionally this isn't an extremely large position to me, so keep that in mind.  
Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor... do your own due diligence.

This is of course just a technical comment and prediction based upon the extraordinary research by /u/Undercover_in_SF

Edit: Yesterday ended up being a dull day without significant volume, which makes sense because AMC’s timeline was likely accelerated by sentiment. What we’re looking into is showing that Friday’s are typically hedging days in these type of smaller plays, so the likelihood of a pop today is pretty strong. The time horizon currently puts a maximum of next Thursday before things get interesting, but I would imagine it happens before then.",2021-09-08 19:36:53

1019,Yet another SPAC Market Update,"Your pal Squirrely over here, providing some insights into the meta world of SPAC investing. This is a follow up to my previous post about [SPAC price discovery that you can review here](https://new.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/oaf2pq/why_price_discovery_is_broken_in_the_spac_market/).

So what's do I think is on the near and longer term horizon in SPAC Land?

**1.Warrant Gang**

With most SPACs trading below $10, ""cheap warrants"" have held their value incredibly well. This is still one of the most mispriced and misunderstood securities in the SPAC market - [especially by retail traders](https://new.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/owf9ah/lcidcciv_s1registration_filed_swap_your_shares/). What's going to be more interesting is that at least one of these SPAC warrants are going to trigger their Crescent Term in the next 3-12 months (What's a crescent term? it's the thing that most of you don't know about and it's the primary reason why many warrants hold value as commons drill down to $4).

On the flipside, for SPACS doing well, warrants will be [continually called for redemption](https://new.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/pg8uk7/please_peter_dont_call_in_the_lcid_warrants_until/hbg88yc/?context=3) (either on a cash or cashless basis). What we haven't seen much (or any) of, is the $10-$18 cashless redemption. It's going to be a shock to some people when a common is trading for $12.50 and suddenly the warrants get redeemed into 0.283 shares of stock. That being said, many of the warrants in this range are trading near or below their cashless conversion prices so this will generally provide upside. I'm writing this because there will invariably dozens of ""I didn't know this could even happen posts"".

The **PSA I keep shouting from the rooftops**: Warrants are incredibly complicated securities, not ""basically cheap 5 year leaps"", and you need to read the S1's and warrant agreements and know each one inside out. There isn't even reliable sources of information for warrants (expiration date is often wrong in Bloomberg), and I've had to have my lawyers email CFO's because their own S1/warrant docs directly contradict each other.

Last thought on warrants is that the latest batch of 13F's are very useful to understand if you're on the same side as ""Smart Money"". Recall that institutions are given warrants for free as sweeteners to participate in SPAC IPOs. Naturally they're on the ""selling side"" of warrant transactions as they try to liquidate them. If you see net institutional buying (i.e. Q2 13F's show more institutions buying vs selling warrants, or even near equal amounts), it's a sign that some professionals have looked into the company and like it for some reason. TWCT (now CLBT) is [a good example of this](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/twctw) where there were 7m+ warrants acquired, and less than 3m sold.

**2. Squeeze/Momentum Gang**

It's been fun, it really has, but we're deep into the 9th inning of this game. The issue with this strategy is that it's a game of implicit collusion. Everyone needs to ""hold the line"", and as more and more people crowd into the trade, everyone tries to front-run each other and sell sooner. It's an unstable equilibrium, and contrary to popular belief (the more people jumping in, the higher open interest on the options, means the bigger the stock will move up), it's actually quite the opposite. There's a ""goldilocks range"" of having enough participants to push the stock up, and simultaneously hold the stock without dumping early. Also the options market makers (Citadel, Jane Street, etc.) are way smarter than retail traders, with bigger balance sheets, and don't delta-hedge their short options positions anymore because they know they just need a $300m buffer to wait out the squeeze and collect the $10m of options premiums they wrote. ""There's soo much gamma, why didn't it SQUOZE?!?""

This works better with GME and AMC because there's no hard deadline of when the game will end. Also, a large contingent of GME/AMC holders are not financially motivated (certainly not in the short run) and are just owning shares for entertainment value. With SPACs, everyone knows that these moves will get crushed by the PIPE unlock that is day/weeks away. Everyone is in it, just make a quick profit. Its mathematically impossible for everyone to make a quick profit. I have all the respect for people who are playing this game at a sophisticated level, but I will continually stress to newcomers to stay away (easiest way to know if you're a fox or a sheep is whether you're writing or reading the squeeze DD). I will also note that I was the first person in recent history to [post about this type of trade](https://new.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ola0rw/a_curious_situation_for_sbgs_owlt_float_after_86/), but specifically avoided using cheerleading language because, shockingly, I wasn't trying to get everyone to jump in and buy my bags. I just wanted to document it so I could refer to it now.

**3. Pipe Unlock Gang**

This is, and will continually be, a valid trade despite it becoming popularized by the LCID + JOBY one-two punch that happened a couple weeks ago. The more obscure trade that will catch people off guard is the sponsor promote unlock that typically comes 150-180 days after despac, and those trades will really start to take shape in the next couple months. Sponsors are highly motivated to liquidate their shares so you'll see 3-5m shares smash the market on the unlock date.

**4. Investment Gang**

I'm still convinced that we won't see a meaningful ""retail bid"" in SPACs, probably ever. So the game that I referred to in my last post is to figure out what institutional investors will be buying in the next 3-12 months.

I generally put SPACS into three buckets, pre-revenue hard tech, early revenue growth, and developed companies. Lets break each one down:

Pre-Revenue Hard Tech

I hate this sector, and think it's an awful place to be. These are the Quantumscape-type companies that are still in heavy R&D and aren't expected to generate a dollar of revenue for 2-5 years. These companies historically raised private money from late-stage Venture/Growth companies. Before doing a $300m funding round, these VCs would do insanely extensive technical diligence to really dive into the technology and understand whether they wanted to back the company's R&D teams. As a retail investor, you cannot get a remote grasp on who good their technical development is. Public institutional investors (large funds that buy common stocks) also largely can't do this. Information asymmetry is extremely high, and in favor of management who is absolutely lying in their investor presentations. I'm not saying all of these companies are frauds or are going to fail, I'm just saying that it's nearly impossible for a retail investor to have an ""edge"" in figuring out which of these companies are more (or less) legit.

There isn't much of an institutional bid for these companies, so I'd be staying away from them. These companies do have meme-value so if that's what you're chasing, best of luck.

Early-Revenue Growth

These are companies that have achieved product-market fit and are starting their hockey-stick revenue (and presumably stock price) trajectory. Think SRNG(DNA) or VACQ(RKLB) type companies. The biggest mistake I see retail investors making here is complaining about high multiples. Multiples are entirely irrelevant in these businesses. There are two things to be looking for in these businesses: contract wins and institutional stock promotion. 

Contract wins provide a strong signal that the technology being sold works, because potential customers have access to far more technical information (and have the ability to digest it) better than any category of investors. I don't care if you have a PhD in aeronautical propulsion, RKLB's deal with Kineis yesterday is a far stronger signal than your 10 page DD. Also while we're on that topic, incremental contract wins are far more important than existing ones, because contracts/deals are often long term and having customers ""stuck"" in a long term deal does not imply the company is doing well. Also, contract win/partnerships for existing commercialized tech, is far more important than early-stage R&D partnerships (Volkswagen with Quantumscape, Toyota with Joby, etc.)

Institutional funds are hungry for growth stories where they can actually see the growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis (unlike the group of companies above). These fund managers are busy and they aren't clicking on reddit DD's wondering what they should buy next. They're golfing at conferences and listening to the CEO/CFO pitch directly to them and providing one on one facetime (or virtual conferences these days, which are far less effective but better than nothing).

Wall Street analysts also have a balance sheet, income statement and statement of cashflows that they can work off of to put together a reasonably sensible forecast. The sales teams at the banks can then make calls to promote the stock to institutional buyers and use the research reports/price targets to back up their sales pitches.

These companies will have a reasonable institutional bid and I expect them to do well. The biggest red flag is that a fair number of companies fall in this bucket but aren't spending time promoting themselves at the institutional level, or making PR announcements about their business developments, or getting sell-side research coverage.

Developed Companies

This is finally where comps and multiples start to matter and make sense. These companies have developed revenue streams and are often profitable, or cashflow (EBITDA) positive. We're talking about companies like BFT(PSFE) or TWCT(CLBT). Note that just because a company is developed, doesn't mean that it doesn't have room for explosive growth (i.e. PSFE with igaming, etc.)

I think this is the easiest bucket to make money with because quantitative algorithms love these types of companies and it's easiest to predict their behaviors. Funds will allocate to the companies blindly (regardless of the company's promotional abilities or sell side research). These companies also have pretty strong floors in place because they aren't incinerating cash, and have extensive operations that have value to a strategic buyer (i.e. BARK has a hard floor of about $5).

Putting it all together:

Obviously I've presented three generalized buckets here and companies fall into a spectrum of the categories. Most importantly I wanted to shed light on some ways to think about some of these companies which will hopefully give people more analytical perspective. I will stress that stock appeal is relative, and many people fall in love with a single stock/story without looking at others. You need to critically look at many stocks, attempt to objectively score them on some of the attributes I've mentioned above, then build a portfolio of them and weight that portfolio based on their relative appeal (spoiler: a portfolio of one stock isn't a portfolio). People always joke about bagholding awful stocks from months past- sell them at a loss and move on with your life. Or sell them, wait 30 days, then decide if you want to buy back in 30 days later. Your mind will be far more objective.

With my posts, I inevitably get the ""so where's the list of tickers?"" question, and I think that's not that different than saying ""tits or gtfo"". 1) I don't share most of my positions because I don't like giving away my alpha. 2) I'm not trying to unload my bags and don't want it to be construed as such 3) I'm an educator and want to help people learn how to analyze investments and strategies versus blindly follow other people's recommendations.

Thanks for reading, hopefully you found a few tidbits of knowledge here. Happy investing to all.",2021-09-10 12:23:05

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 13th, 2021.

# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.
*****
> The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve’s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.
*****
> Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed’s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed’s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.
*****
> The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.
*****
> # Hot CPI
> “If the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
> Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August’s producer price index — which was released Friday — showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png
*****
> The Fed’s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August’s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
> “Certainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it’s an issue for the bond market if it’s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,” CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.
*****
> “If markets have an inflation mutiny here and there’s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,” Donabedian said of the Fed’s taper announcement. “But I think there’s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.”
*****
> # Stagflation?
> That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August’s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.
*****
> “I’m more about the ‘flation’ side of it than the ‘stag.’ I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,” Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a “short-term warning.”

> “We had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It’s really settled down now,” he said. “There was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you’re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you’re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.”
*****
> Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.
*****
> “With where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,” he said. “Even though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There’s income there for consumers to spend. We’re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.”
*****
> Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.
*****
> “It has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don’t have that,” he said. “These are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn’t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn’t call it stagflation.”

> Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.
*****
> Stocks were lower this week, with the S&P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.
*****
> A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed’s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png
*****
> “We’re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,” Donabedian said. “These are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it’s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.”
*****
> # Now watch Congress
> Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.
*****
> “They’re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,” he said. “It’s the overall corporate tax rate, it’s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.”
*****
> He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. “Those sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it’s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.”
*****
> The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market’s gains. “One very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That’s a direct hair cut,” he said.

> # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens

> Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of ""moderate"" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**

> In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks

> Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The ""reddit army"" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**

> The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**

> To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma & Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**

> Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.

> To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.

> # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago

> Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**

> Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner & Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**

> The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&P 500 has returned 310.61%.

> # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month

> September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

> # September quarterly option expiration week: S&P 500 up 13 of last 18

> September’s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.

> # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?

> This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.

> In today’s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.

> The S&P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.

> The catch (and there’s always a catch) is the S&P 500 hasn’t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.

> But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. “Looking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “So should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

> Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.

> From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.

> Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.

1021,Vega-Positive swing trading. Is there a right and wrong way?,"I have been trading for over a year now (I'm a COVID-trader baby) and have been playing options almost exclusively since late February of this year.  I am mainly a seller of options now to generate semi-predictable income on a weekly or bi-weekly basis using iron condors.  I find it pretty low risk, low maintenance style of trading that fits my current life style.  However, I do miss being directionally biased and trend trading which can quickly amount to some really nice returns.

I have 2 strategies right now:

Neutral bias -- short iron condors on weekly/biweekly expiries that make up the bulk of my trades.

Directionally biased vertical spreads --  Sell calls/puts on tickers I am comfortable with, buy protective puts/calls in equal abundance to the sold contracts, and then buy far OTM calls/puts to not increase cost basis too much over a normal vertical spread.  This has the benefit of a net credit upfront, limited downside risk ala a typical credit spread, and then the directionally long calls/puts leverage the return in the direction I think the ticker is moving.  However, I am not sure if this leveraging vega as efficiently as I could be to really see those nice pops in premium to the upside/downside on my long legs to make the trade super profitable outside of the upfront credit received.  

I want to add in swing trading to the mix on stocks I like and don't mind ""owning"" but using options to leverage my ROI.  At the end of the day, I don't truly care about any of these companies strong enough to buy and hold and be an investor.  Is the only way to do this longing calls or puts in low vega scenarios (i.e. when historical volatility outweighs implied volatility) and hoping for the best?  From my basic understanding, Vega will typically spike higher on downside moves, which is counterintuitive to the swing trading/longing stocks idea of buying low and selling high, right?  Meaning in theory I could get the direction right but the higher premiums and theta decay can hurt me from the get go.  

I have looked it up online and on YouTube and I will admit maybe I am not looking in the right places, but is it possible to leverage Historical v. Implied Volatility, IV Rank, and Vega into a swing position?  If so, what are some of the best ways to do it?  Worth noting, I have a smaller account, $25,000 or so and I would prefer to be a bit more risk averse.  Would a PMCC or running The Wheel be about the way to do this to leverage Vega somewhat safely without buying my typical risk-levels worth of OTM calls and hoping for a miracle, ala GME and AMC style?

Thank you!",2021-09-11 10:14:23
1022,"$43k to a quarter million (almost) challenge. YOLO'd my 401k and individual accounts into AMC, GME, and speculative stocks in January. Don't do options yet. How am I doing?",,2021-09-14 00:13:49
1023,"Forex Newbie, paper trading"," 

Hey all as the title indicates, I'm just starting out in Forex. I have a little bit of experience trading stocks from a year ago, but I ended up cashing everything out to use towards a downpayment for my house. I made a lot of mistakes and also learned a lot from that experience and was very lucky to break even in the end by basically doubling my account off of GME and AMC last winter before it was time to withdraw my funds. Im interested in getting into Forex because of the more flexible market hours as I am a shift worker. In the past couple of weeks I've immersed myself in videos and articles, as well as reading posts on this subreddit.

Here's a paper trade that I entered this morning on the EUR/USD on the hourly chart. Wondering if it's okay to post my trade set ups here to get feed back on my thought process...

So I entered a short position here with this bearish price action breaking down below the 200ema line. The MACD line is also crossing down and there is a lower low on the RSI as well. I set my stop loss just above the blue 50ema line as I think that would invalidate this set up and take profit and previous strong support level.

1024,HOLD DEEP OTM CALL OPTIONS AT NO COST,"For those that want a higher profit curve when AMC moons.. NFA

We all do it... Deep OTM calls that almost never pan out but when they do it means faster lambos..

Hedge fucks get us that way and use that as a steady source of income to cover the cost of their shorts. So I say flip that shit on them and use their strategies against them.

Here is how it goes:

Recycle time : 1 week

If you are a XXX holder or more sell a near the money call option for a credit using 100 shares as collateral. Then go to the last strike price and buy as many OTM call options as the credit gives you.

Senario 1: stock price falls, otm option worth less, but covered by the credit received.

Senario 2: stock price stays the same, otm option worth less, but covered by the credit received

Senario 3: stock price goes up slightly but under the near the money strike price, still profit from your shares, otm option worthless, but covered by the credit received

Senario 4: stock price blows past your near the money strike but not enough to reach the OTM call option, keep the credit received, cover the exercised near the money call option with your shares at a profit (strike - avg) and quickly buy your position back to maintain your shares. OTM option worthless, covered by credit received.

Senario 5: stock price moons.... Nuff said

What this does is essentially forces the market makers and hedge fucks to finance your gamble at no cost to you. And since the amount of otm long calls are much higher than what you are selling near the money, you force the hedge fucks and market makers to hedge their options positions by buying more stock.

Example: AMC Price 47.80 Hold 100 shares of AMC stock at 47.80 Sell 1 53 call option for 0.87 Buy 22 145 call options for 0.04

I do this every week on Monday and have maintained an options and raw stock position since February without adding more money to my account.

1026,Thinking About YOLOing Into AMC Stock,"Now hear me out, because I know how crazy that sounds. I have an account valuation ~$10K and I'd like to grow my account more. I was just reviewing some of the stock I hold (BofA and NYCB) then wondering how crazy would it be to capitalize on the volatility of AMC stock while still high and selling CCs. Am I crazy or could this be a viable, profitable solution to grow my account? 

Note: It would make almost half my portfolio with AMC, but I *also* don't see it dropping below 40 any time soon. However, the lack of diversity is something to consider.",2021-09-17 00:14:21

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Last week Energy was the leading sector. The top 3 leading industries were Oil & Gas E&P, Auto & Truck Dealerships, and REIT - Hotel & Motel. With the market starting to pull back, intraday trading was great. A couple weeks ago, I said that the QQQ would likely pull back to the 367 area and today pre - market it has hit that level.

All indices are gapping down this morning. I have over 440 gaps on my initial early scan of the day and will likely have a couple hundred more before the market opens. The majority of stocks are gapping down. There is a FED meeting this week on the 21-22 which is likely the cause of the gap down in the markets. Not many earnings plays being released and things will stay that way until later on in October when Alcoa reports to kick off earnings. My plan today is to concentrate on the best daily charts, with volume. Often we get a bounce on big gap days but not sure we will today. If the market sells off, then I will look at UVXY for some long opportunities if they present themselves. If you aren't comfortable trading these big gap days, just take it easy and observe, there will always be better days to trade. Good luck!

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Yesterday Energy was the leading sector. Aluminum, Oil & Gas E&P, and Resorts & Casinos were the leading industries. The markets in general moved higher as the FED leaves interest rates unchanged. Intraday trading was ok if you were trading the right stocks, primarily small caps had nice action. 

The SPY is gapping up into it's short term moving averages pre-market which could cause some resistance but not entirely sure, as in the recent past months, we have just grinded through them back up to highs every time the market dips. If the market doesn't just push higher through it's averages, we may need to base/consolidate, and maybe even decline a bit more before moving higher. There are a few good gaps pre-market but nothing special. I'll run a scan after the open to see if I like anything and If I don't I'll just sit out and wait for better days with more opportunities. Good luck out there.

1036,Bubble is bursting,"Tesla, crypto, AMC, GME, and Cathie Wood all have one thing in common. They detach from normal valuations and begin trading as their own currencies. The same thing happened in the late ‘90’s. Stocks traded higher and higher as they melted up. The stocks themselves are traded as currencies rather than companies. Remember when Buffet tells you that when you buy a stock you need to remember you’re buying a business that actually yields something. Crypto is not a company - i guess it could be an asset used for trading. But it isn’t traded for anything of use, except more dollars if you’re lucky i guess...very similar to pokemon cards lol. And that’s the point, it all goes back to the dollar. I love my digital dollars in my digital wallet (my phone).",2021-09-24 01:24:20

I'm all over the place with stocks, I've invested in steel, AMC, and Blackberry, basically learning and experience some small losses and gains. Does it make sense to hold a handful of big companies in your portfolio? Like having a portfolio of Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc., plus a few smaller stocks? Is this a different strategy, or something that should be included in a portfolio? I haven't considered it because the stock prices are big, but over time those big companies have all increased and done well (I guess until they don't).",2021-09-24 18:34:01

1040,Rising bond yields: what they mean and how to play this,"**TL;DR: Rising bond yields means investors should rotate from growth to value. Avoid ARK ETFs at all costs, they have underperformed for a reason. We have yet to see capitulation.** 

&#x200B;

I'm sure you've all seen the headlines over the past week or so about rising bond yields, and I'm honestly surprised that the majority of investors I've talked to don't know how this affects their stock allocations. They read about the rising bond yields and how that hurts growth stocks, but the articles never dive into exactly why this happens. I felt compelled to write this post because I found out my mother put the majority of her 401K into QQQ, ARKK, and ARKG back in July. The recent downwards move in these names has her spooked, and on the phone she mentioned she has no idea why these ETFs (ARKK and ARKG in particular) are going down more than the rest of the market.

&#x200B;

To preface this post, this is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. But I have been investing my own money for the better part of the past two decades and have seen long term success. I've learned a lot from my friends who work in the industry over the years so hopefully I can shed some light on how institutions, the ones driving the market, operate. I commonly rotate my investments based on what I've learned and macroeconomic variables in order to achieve a more optimal strategic positioning in the market.

&#x200B;

Now, onto rising bond yields. This site lets you see the yields for notes of various maturities: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield). All of the bond yields have risen this past week, but the one of particular concern is the yield on the 2 YR treasury note. It hasn't been this high since March 2020, and analysts are projecting it will rise even higher.

&#x200B;

This move was fueled by fears of more persistent inflation, the upcoming taper that will begin after the November Fed meeting, and the prospect of rate hikes coming sooner than originally anticipated.  The Fed isn't alone either. Central Banks all around the world have signaled plans to tighten monetary policy: the BoE for example [https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691](https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691), Brazil (except no one really cares about Brazil) [https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike), and countries in the Eurozone [https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH).

&#x200B;

Fed officials at the most recent meeting moved up their expectations for a rate hike in 2022 and increased the number of rate hikes expected in 2023 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/)). If inflation continues to persist, which is likely due to strong demand-pull and supply-side constraints like the disruptions we're seeing in Southeast Asia due to Covid, then we'll see these rate hike expectations move forward even more. A higher federal funds rate results in higher bond yields.

&#x200B;

The market digested this information from last week and it is now being priced into the market. So why do growth stocks get hammered more than the rest of the market when bond yields rise? Even today, for October 1st, the NASDAQ rose 0.65% while the S&P 500 rose a whopping 1.23%.

&#x200B;

The reason is because of how companies are fundamentally valued. After all, the market isn't a casino, even though it can seem like it at times. Shout out to GME and AMC. So what does a company's stock price really represent?

&#x200B;

Fundamentally, a company's stock price represents the present value of its future cash flows. This valuation method is commonly used in the industry and is known as a discounted cash flow (read [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) if you want to expand on this even more but I'll summarize). Basically, how do you calculate the **present** value of **future** cash flows? You take those future cash flows and you *discount* them by the risk free rate, often represented by bond yields. The reason we do this discounting is because that future cash flow is worth less BECAUSE it happens in the future. That money, if available in the present, could have generated the risk free rate each year.

Let's look at an example to see how discounting works. Let us assume stock A is expected to produce cash flow of $100 in 2022, $200 in 2023, and $500 in 2024 and the risk free rate is 1%.

&#x200B;

We get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.01 + $200/(1.01)\^2 + $500/(1.01)\^3 = $780

&#x200B;

But what happens if the risk free rate increases to 2%?

&#x200B;

Then we get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.02 + $200/(1.02)\^2 + $500/(1.02)\^3 = $761

&#x200B;

The key takeaway from this is that rising bond yields mean future cash flows will be worth less at present. The reason growth stocks get so hammered on moves in bond yields is because the majority of their cash flow comes in the future, and that's why they can be valued so richly when bond yields are at record lows (like through all of 2020 and the beginning of 2021). Take Nikola, for example, it currently has no free cash flow but it's valued because it promises future free cash flow. Quantumscape, TuSimple, and so many more names fall into this category.

&#x200B;

Growth stocks have fallen out of favor for this reason and is why ARKK, ARKG, and all of the other ARK ETFs have already dropped over 20% from their all time highs. The concentration of growth stocks in the NASDAQ is also the reason for its underperformance this past week.

&#x200B;

Reddit forums always scream, ""don't fight the FED,"" and they're right. For times like these, it's best to rotate out of growth and into value names. The Fed TELLS you what they're going to do and this past Fed meeting was the most hawkish Fed meeting I've listened to in a long time. I'm not claiming that markets will crash, far from it, I'm simply claiming that growth stocks are not where you want to be.

This is going to hit a capitulation point when bond yields rise even more. This Twitter post shows the underperformance of ARKK's investments: [https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2](https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2). The only reason ARK is even alive is because of Tesla, and rising bond yields will eventually catch up to Tesla too, which is currently valued at 400x PE. You might be thinking now is a good time to pick up these names at a discount, but that would be ill-advised. If you're planning to hold for the next decade and through a potential 50-90% drawdown, then go ahead.

&#x200B;

There's a reason Michael Burry has been shorting ARKK ([https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html)) and one of the largest positions in his fund is a Tesla short ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html)) specifically because he foresees an unfavorable environment for growth stocks.

&#x200B;

If you've been wondering why SPACs have been dying, this is why.

&#x200B;

If you've been wondering why your growth stocks have been dying, this is why.

&#x200B;

If you've been debating whether or not to sell your ARK ETFs, this is why. Cathie Wood is simply a marketing genius who got lucky off moonshot plays in Bitcoin and Tesla, and then leveraged that success to convince the public to drive in-flows into her ARK ETFs over the past years. Those inflows helped propel a bunch of growth names higher, but ARK will eventually be a victim of its own success as outflows force selling into already declining stock prices. This reddit post is from February of 2021 when ARKK died because of, you guessed it, rising bond yields: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors\_beware\_arkk\_is\_a\_liquidity\_disaster/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/). Looking at the 2 YR yield, this time might be significantly worse. This is why I told my mother to move everything over to $VTI and a selection of value names: $ADNT, $GM, $F, $KRE, $HEES, $HRI, etc.

&#x200B;

The ONLY stock in ARKK with a reasonable PE multiple is COIN. Every other name has a multiple in either the high-flying hundreds, or the stock is simply a money burning piece of shit experiencing slowing growth. GL investors - stay safe out there. If you've been holding ARKK, it's okay to take a loss. When investing, and over the long run, losses are bound to happen. My biggest losses all came from holding onto the hope that my stock would recover, even though I knew deep down it wouldn't.

1047,SEC Form 13H - Large Trader - My Experience,"I am an individual day trader. I overtraded one day and was flagged as a ""Large Trader"" by my broker asking me to register with SEC and obtain a Large Trader ID. Getting this notice can be intimidating for retail traders who don’t want to get entangled in anything that has ""SEC"" in its name, but this one is not that bad.

I am summarizing my experience in the post below on what I had to do to get the Large Trader ID. I might miss some steps (as I am recollecting from memory) or the online submission process might change after I write this post, make sure you follow FAQ on the SEC website. And lastly… I am not responsible if you mess up with your form or make a mistake. Do your research, I'm just trying to be helpful to those who got the Form 13H notice

Note: This is for individual traders only, who are trading their own capital and are not associated with any trading firm

&#x200B;

I originally started off by asking questions here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/pu5bb3/sec\_form\_13h\_larger\_trader\_notice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/pu5bb3/sec_form_13h_larger_trader_notice) and got some advise.

&#x200B;

**Large Trader**

SEC came up with a way to identify a “Large Trader” in the market to track the activity of HFT algos and day traders working for big institutions who have  a big enough capital to significantly influence prices in the stock market. While this predominantly applies to professional traders associated with an institution, it also inadvertently flags individual traders with bigger capital who make hundreds of trades each day.

&#x200B;

**Criteria For Being Flagged as a Large Trader**

*A Large Trader is any U.S. or non-U.S. person or entity that trades or controls trading (in one or more accounts) in U.S. exchange-listed stock and option transactions equaling or exceeding:*

* *Two million shares or $20 million during any calendar day; or*
* *20 million shares or $200 million during any calendar month.*

*Note that for purposes of determining the value of shares traded, each option contract is assumed to be equal to 100 shares of its underlying security (or other share equivalent if adjusted by OCC).*

&#x200B;

**Can individual traders get flagged as Large Traders?**

Yes, absolutely. Folks cashing out their TSLA or GME or AMC profits that exceed this threshold or those who simply overtraded can expect to get this notice. In case of over-traders, it's actually quite easy with a large account but can be painful. As an example, make 150 trades (75 round trip orders) of AAPL in a day where each trade buys/sells exactly 1000 shares. Technically, you’re only transacting < $150K in dollar value per one-way trade (assuming AAPL is \~ $150) but when you add up the aggregate amount you’ve transacted over 150 trades, it comes to over $20M in dollar value. While it might sound like you've unlocked an achievement, the commissions will severely wipe out your gains

&#x200B;

**Are there exceptions?**

No exceptions. Individual traders flagged as a large trader have to register with SEC and file Form 13H. The process is quite simple once you get past the first step with SEC.

&#x200B;

**What Now?**

After your big day (either overtrading or cashing out your massive gains), your broker will most likely send you a ""Large Trader"" notice and ask you to fill Form 13H with SEC. Below is my experience on how i went about it

&#x200B;

**Step 1: Notification From Broker**

Either your broker notifies you that you've crossed this threshold and asks you to register with SEC (or) you can pro-actively register with SEC if you know ahead of time if you plan on trading large volumes

&#x200B;

**Step 2: Register with SEC via the EDGAR filing system**

* Fill FormID to get a CIK (similar to username) and a passphrase
   * Apply for Form ID: [https://www.filermanagement.edgarfiling.sec.gov/filermgmt/Welcome/EDGARFilerMgmtMain.htm](https://www.filermanagement.edgarfiling.sec.gov/filermgmt/Welcome/EDGARFilerMgmtMain.htm)
   * Select ""**Large Trader**"" as applicant type
   * Instructions and FAQs
      * [http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/quick-reference/form-id.pdf](http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/quick-reference/form-id.pdf)
      * [http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/form-id-faq.pdf](http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/form-id-faq.pdf)
      * [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/large-trader-faqs.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/large-trader-faqs.htm)
   * Note: You will not be able to submit your FormID application without completing Step 3 below

&#x200B;

**Step 3: Get FormID notarized**

* Save the online form using the save button on top of the form. It will generate a **ID-NEWCIK.eis** file  (or something similar) that contains your application information. Save that file to your computer.
* You will need that file to log back in and retrieve your ""in progress"" online application
* After saving the FormID application online, you will have to print it using the print icon on the last step of the form wizard
* The printout will be 3 pages. Get them notarized (i only got the last page notarized and it was sufficient)
* Note: It might be a good idea to sign the form in front of the Notary agent.

&#x200B;

**Step 4 - Upload scanned copy of notarized FormID application**

* Scan the notarized document (all three pages) and upload it back to the form as an attachment
* Use CORRESP as the document type when uploading
* Submit the form online

&#x200B;

**Step 5 - Get Access Codes**

* After submitting application, SEC will take 1-2 business days to process/verify and will email you result.
* If SEC accepted your submission, the acceptance email will contain the CIK
* If SEC rejected your submission, they will let you know why
* Once you get the CIK, click below link to generate the CIK Confirmation Code (CCC), Password and Password Modification Authorization Code (PMAC)
* Get Access Codes here: [https://www.filermanagement.edgarfiling.sec.gov](https://www.filermanagement.edgarfiling.sec.gov)

&#x200B;

**Step 6 - File Form 13H**

* Once you get all the access codes, head over to [https://www.edgarfiling.sec.gov](https://www.edgarfiling.sec.gov) and fill form 13H
* As an Individual trader, you will be completing some of the section using either NA or ""Individual Trader""
   * For Authorized Person - Use your own name and information
   * For ""Business of Large Trader"" - select ""Other"" and enter ""Individual Trader""
   * For ""Organizational Information"" - enter ""Individual Trader"" on all applicable boxes
   * For list of brokers, enter name of broker where your day trading account is held. This is the broker that originally sent you the Larger Trader notification

&#x200B;

**Step 7 - Get Large Trader ID (LTID)**

* Once form 13H is filled online, the LTID will be generated immediately and displayed on the screen
* You will also receive an email with the LTID and other details
* Once you get the LTID, provide it to your broker by following instructions they provided
* That's it! you're done. Now everytime your transactions hit the threshold, your broker will notify SEC and you dont have to worry about it

&#x200B;

**Step 8 - Paperwork**

* You will have to file form 13H annually. Check SEC website for details and cadence
* If you no longer hit those thresholds and haven't hit them in over one year, you can contact SEC and have the Large Trader ID status removed from your account

&#x200B;

**Important**

* Save the CIK, CCC, PassPhrase, Password and PMAC securely as SEC will not be saving this information on their end
* Preserve all emails that you get from SEC

&#x200B;

**Contact Support:**

If you're stuck and need help, contact SEC. They are actually quite helpful if you can get a hold of them

* For filling FormID: [TradingAndMarkets@SEC.GOV](mailto:TradingAndMarkets@SEC.GOV) \- 202-551-8900, option 3
* For filling 13H - 202-551-5777",2021-10-11 18:05:04
1048,ULTIMATE Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 5 - Diving Deep into Volatility (Important),"# This post will dive into one of the most important concepts in options trading.

# Understanding this concept will change the way you think about options trading (for the better). The concept is called volatility.

As an option trader, you are expressing a view on volatility... some know this and others don't :P

Because options expire, we now have be aware not just of what direction the stock will move, but *by how much* it will move in a given time period.

Note: you can find the previous parts of this series on my profile.

If you have questions about this post, please leave a comment and I will get back to you.

Let's get started!!

# Example 1: Comparing 2 stocks.

Lets say we are looking at $AMC and $KO (Coca Cola), and we want to compare how each of these stocks moves over a 3 day period.

If we look at KO, this is a company that has been around for a long time. We understand how much money they make, how they make it, what their future revenue is likely to be, etc.. So on a day to day basis, we shouldn't expect massive swings in the stock price.

Perhaps on day 1 we see the stock move +1%, then -1% on day 2, and then +2% on day 3.

But what if we looked at AMC?

From what we know about AMC, it moves a lot. It could move up 10% 1 day, down 15% the next day and the back up 20% on the third day!

Thinking about these two stocks. It's should be clear that KO is much more stable than AMC. There is a lot less risk on KO than AMC.

# So, which of these stocks do you think would have more costly options?

The reason AMC options would be more pricey relative to $KO is because there is more *risk* that AMC moves a lot. Remember, the options market tries to price what is going to happen in the future.. Since it is a lot more probable that AMC moves 10% tomorrow than Coca Cola, *the options of AMC imply more future big move risk than the options for KO.*

**The simple way to put this would be:** ***AMC is more volatile than KO.***

If both stocks were trading at $100 per share, we would expected a $100 strike call option on AMC to be much more expensive, since there's a higher chance of it having a bigger move. Remember! In a trade, there is a buyer and a seller.

So if that option on AMC was only like $2, we would all want to buy them, and no one would want to sell them, so the price would go up (supply and demand).

# So why do we care about volatility?

It's the factor that the market looks at to determine how much the options should be trading for.

Most retail traders are *price insensitive* in the options space. They are more focused on the *exposure* the options give them, rather than the cost of the option. But as we move through this lesson.. really start to think about the value of options. If we can go out and find an option trading for $10 that is really worth $5, we've found a really good trade. So let's try to tie everything here back to *the value of options.*

# Checkpoint summary 1:

1. Volatility is simply the size of the move for a given stock.
2. The a big factor in the price of options is how volatile the market thinks a stock will be in the future
3. Since volatility is a big part of how the market prices options, we can say that the option prices *imply future volatility*.
4. volatility is not direction. fundamentally it is the size of the moves, not the direction the stock goes.
5. If you are trading options, you are trading volatility. Understanding volatility is an important part of understanding how to trade options.

# The 3 Circles of Volatility

Now that we understand (in general) what volatility is, we need to understand that there are *different forms of volatility* that impact every single stock. To explain this, theres a demonstration made by Predicting Alpha that explains it really well. It's called the **3 circles of volatility**.

# There are 3 forms of volatility that impact any given stock.

1. The first form of volatility is called **market volatility**.

The market has volatility. All of the stocks we can look at exist within the market. Let's say the market crashes. All of the stocks that we are looking at would also take a huge hit. The market overhands all of the stocks we look at, and what happens to the overall market impacts all of the stocks.

[All stocks exist within the market, and are therefore subject to what happens to the market.](https://preview.redd.it/cbppljlin1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e7fddeffaf02a08cf8aa70fa1c13a605671ce6b6)

2) The second form of volatility is called **non-event volatility**

Let's say we zoomed in and looked at one stock in particular. We would find another form of volatility called *non-event volatility.* Non event volatility is the movement of a stock on its regular day to day. How has the company been doing? Does it move on average 1% a day? or 10% a day? For example, $KO is going to have less non event volatility than $AMC. Different stocks move different amounts regularly.

&#x200B;

[Each stock has its unique day to day movement, specific to the trading around that company.](https://preview.redd.it/4147qqrbm1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=be8859f4afd2f96ce4657259696dc1ac244c2e61)

&#x200B;

3) The third form of volatility is called **event volatility**

If we zoom in a bit further, we see that within each company there are key events that drive big movement in the share price. Earnings events, product releases, drug approvals, etc. Company events introduce new information into the market, leading to ""jumps"" in share price that we typically wouldn't see. Because of this, events can drive short bursts of high volatility for a stock.

[Within the regular movement of a stock, there are big events that drive short bursts of rapid stock movement.](https://preview.redd.it/emm3b69am1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4e1b573b42a8fbbab6d6be3623836c74c3fbfd3a)

By taking these 3 forms of volatility into consideration, we are able to understand what's causing the stock to move, or impacting the price of the options.

For example, If the stock market crashes, it will overshadow the non-event volatility of a company. Even though the stock maybe moves only 1% a day on average, a market crash could cause it to move a lot more.

For another example, When GME was moving like crazy over the last few months, event volatility around their earnings releases was almost the same as non-event volatility, almost as if no ""event impact"" was being priced in.

# Relating it back to options

Let's say we are looking at an option expiring in 30 days. Taking into consideration the 3 forms of volatility, the market is going to try to determine how much the stock is likely to move over the next 30 days.

If the stocks trading at $100 and the at-money call and put are each going for $5 (5% of the share price), we can add them up and see that the ""range"" the market implies (the at-the-money straddle) is $10 in price, or 10% of the share price.

This tells us that the market thinks the stock will move up or down 10% in the next 30 days. The option prices are reflecting the *market implied volatility*.

Let's say in the middle of those 30 days there is an earnings event. We can now says that the market volatility , non event volatility AND event volatility are all a part of the ""10% up or down"" that the market is baking into the price of the options.

[All 3 forms of volatility are impacting this option. Can you think of how the event volatility can skew our view on the time period?](https://preview.redd.it/o1enqjj8m1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=976f5bc7e0363066de50dc3ba4076662f2a4db05)

Why is this important? Well, if we know there is an earnings event in the middle of that time period, we can use the 3 circles to think that *a lot of the 10% move the market is implying might happen on that 1 day, and we will see very small moves on the other 29 days.* We can use some analytics tools to try to separate the event and non event volatility to understand if this is the case, which is really useful for selling options and knowing *exactly what you are selling.*

&#x200B;

[We can extract the event volatility from the non-event\/market volatility. This helps us understand how much the market is implying for the event, and how the value of options will change after the event passes.](https://preview.redd.it/o8rck0o6m1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24e0312f81963013ac2bdef1efc04453b0488222)

The picture above shows the term structure for DAL and how much earnings event volatility is priced into the different DTEs (earnings is this week).

# A cool thing about the 3 circles of volatility is that we can isolate which one we want to trade

Depending on what you think is mispriced, you can isolate one of the forms of volatility. For example, If you just want to trade an earnings event, you can structure your trade to remove a lot of market and non-event volatility!

More on this in a future post where we talk about earnings trading.

# Checkpoint summary 2:

1. There are 3 forms of volatility that impact a stock. Market volatility, non-event volatility, and event volatility.
2. Market volatility is like the ""tide that rises and lows all ships"", non-event volatility is the day to day movement of a stock, and event volatility is a short burst of big movements caused by new information coming into the market (earnings, product releases, etc).
3. The option price reflects the impact of each of these 3 forms of volatility within the days to expiration of the option.
4. We can isolate different forms of volatility depending on what we want to trade.

# Implied VS Realized Volatility.

Imagine you are at a horse-racing track, and you want to place a bet on the next race.

You take a look at the odds, and see that the horse named Seabiscuit has 4:1 odds on it coming first place. Nice! The market is saying that you only need to risk 1 to make 4 if Seabiscuit comes in first. You do some math, and you think that theres a 50% chance he will come in first (market is implying about a 25% chance) and decide it's a good bet. So you place your bet.

Then the race starts, and even though he was off to a good start, Seabiscuit ends up coming in 4th place. Damn.

When you went to place the bet, the market gave you a bet you could choose to take. The market was *implying a certain likelihood of that horse winning*.

Then the race started , and the *realized outcome,* or what actually ended up happening was that Seabiscuit lost the race.

This is like what happens in the options space..

**Implied volatility** is how much the market *thinks* the stock will move in the future.

**Realized volatility** is *how much the stock actually ends up moving.*

# How does the market determine implied volatility?

The basic way to think about this, is that the market participants look at the 3 circles of volatility and make an opinion about how much each of them will impact the stock between now and the option's expiration. The market consensus on each form of volatilities impact will then become the *market implied volatility*.

If the stock moves more than what was implied, the buyer makes money.. If the stock moves less than what is implied, the seller makes money (there is nuance to this, but for this lesson we are keeping it simple).

**note**: There are tools out there that help you graph and analyze the difference between implied and realized volatility. You can get some basic charts in most brokerages. My preferred tool is Predicting Alpha Terminal which allows me to do some unreal analysis.

For example, here's the IV/RV ratios for $KO and $AMC.

[There are tons of analytics specific to volatility. The insights help us understand the value of options better, and therefore make more money trading.](https://preview.redd.it/kovfuu04m1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=abe139e2a55ec24cf4667d7b2b7ff623fa8982d0)

It's pretty cool. This shows us the gap between the implied and realized volatility for each of those companies on the same graph. Looks like they have both steadied out to a similar spread.

# Checkpoint summary 3:

1. Implied volatility is how much the market thinks the stock will move in the future
2. realized volatility is how much the stock actually ends up moving
3. If we have a different opinion from the market, and we end up being closed to what the stock ""realizes"" , we should make money.

# OK so we understand the ""bet the market presents us with"" (implied volatility), and ""what actually ends up happening"" (realized volatility), but how do we know what side of the trade to be on?

You remember in the horse racing example how we said that you think the odds of Seabiscuit winning are 50%, but the market is implying a 25% chance? This is an extremely important part of the example.

The reason it is so important, is because *that is why you took the bet!*

Think about it. If you agree with the bookie on his odds and likelihood of winning, why would you take the bet? You know that he skews the odds a bit in his favor (revisit my post on expected value if you need to), so taking that bet would have negative expectancy.

# The reason we took the trade is because our forecast for the race was different from the market.

# We do the same thing in the option market.

The market presents us with options priced at a particular implied volatility level. *Our job is to come up with our own forecast of future volatility.*

You can think of your ""forecast"" as your opinion on things. If the market thinks a stock isn't going to move a lot, but you think it will, options are cheap. If the market is implying that the stock will move more than you think it actually will, options are expensive.

If we can develop a really solid forecast of future volatility, options trading becomes pretty straight forward. Now of course, if it were easy to do we would all have matching lambos already. But this is the fun of trading, the better opinions you can develop, and the better you can express those opinions, the more money you should make.

# Conclusion

*""Gold slips away from the person who invests gold into purposes through which they are not familiar""*

That is a quote from a book called The Richest Man in Babylon that often comes to mind when I see traders getting into trades without understanding the product and space they are participating in.

To be honest, a lot of times it's this lack of familiarity that can drive inefficiencies that more sophisticated traders profit from.

Let's keep in mind that options are volatility products. Let's strive to learn more about how these products are priced and how to create good views of the future. There is plenty of opportunity for retail traders to make money, but it all starts by understanding the product we trade, and how to trade it.

If you have questions, please leave them in the comments below and I will do my best to get back to everyone.

# In my next post, I will dive into how to isolate event volatility for earnings trades, and how I have been able to make a living trading earnings events as a primary strategy.

Happy trading everyone.

1052,Is it ok to hold multiple ETF's? (I am a noob),"Hey all,

I'm pretty new to investing, I really only got into it when GME was big in the news. I've since been doing some research. I'm 21, full time student, with part time work so my income is pretty low. I have both a personal account and TFSA on Wealthsimple. On my personal account right now I'm holding some meme stocks that I got during the GameStop hype (GME, AMC, BB, NOK) and in my TFSA I have ATZ (awesome, get it if you haven't yet), RBLX (I think Roblox is gonna be a cool long term play) XEQT, and VEQT.

My understanding of things is pretty limited and other than doing my own (brief) research and lurking this sub, I basically have no idea what I'm doing.

I'm wondering: is it better to just pick one ETF for the long haul? My current plan is to just max my TFSA between XEQT, VEQT, VFV, and VGRO, and then I maybe in my personal account is where I'd put ATZ and RBLX.

At some point, I'm going to dump all my meme stocks and just put all that money into said ETFs. I'm just waiting to see what happens with GME. My meme stock money was all money I could afford to lose anyway.

I have about 10,000$ saved up that I'd really like to dump into good investments.

I'm also curious about crypto. At some point I used Wealthsimple crypto to get some BTC but I lost 100 bucks and decided to pull out. I just downloaded the Newton app and am wanting to research other coins.

I also get a lot of things about crypto in my TikTok feed saying ""buy this new coin, it's going to the moon"". My gut feeling is it's all BS and to stick to established coins like BTC and Ethereum. Is this correct thinking?

Thank you.",2021-10-17 16:54:46
1053,who are here the holder of $KPLT ? some thoughts about $KPLT,"Basically i am very bullish on $KPLT at this price $4.85, here's why

1. When u look at the number of buys from insider and institutional holders when this one crash in august due to removal of their guidance, this shows smart money actually think the stock price around $3\~5 is a steal. (The highest buy from insider is $4.42, which means CEO actually didnt expect market can be way overreacting that the price can drop to \~$3)

https://preview.redd.it/l67gnekm35u71.png?width=2359&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6772155fddceeeaa5926d2dbd31fbb1c9186f47f

[https://fintel.io/so/us/318085206](https://fintel.io/so/us/318085206)

&#x200B;

2) Their revenue multiple now is absurdly low compared to other BNPL growth stock. with the stock trading at this range basically means that market expect KPLT with no growth in the coming years or going bankrupt soon which is ridiculous. if they can show some slight revenue growth and give us Q4 guidance in the upcoming Q3 earning call (11/9), this one will surely be back at least $8.

https://preview.redd.it/f9it5tsta5u71.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a5474eb294cb6d4fcd202d4e0dac48a144e45d18

3) One of the main concern people worry about this stock in their last Q2 earning is that `their LTO origination was down 17% YOY.` But i think this chart can explain this massive Year over year LTO origination decline. as they had exceptionally great Q2 last year due to COVID stimulus, which is one time surge only and made their `LTO origination` in Q2 2021 looks really bad. but when compared it to Q1 2021, it is still up 1%. so it is actually not that bad.

4) Recent great direct partnership with Salesforce and Adobe.

5) Recent indirect waterfall partnership from Affirm with (Amazon, Target, Walmart). The amazon - affirm deal actually sent $KPLT all the way up to $7\~$8 in September.

6) High short interest makes it a good short squeeze candidate

https://preview.redd.it/6rbfbkjs95u71.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5a57607058481ea10518a29481a9dcfd21acec3

7) insanely low institutional put / call ratio 0.21 when compared with other high short interest stocks (most of them have ratio > 0.8)

8) Their fail to deliver going into power this week, with this 2.6 million shares fail to deliver, and last friday the Market maker shorted more just to make the 5$ call expire worthless, this one has high chance to take off today or Tuesday.

Short borrow fee rate is 19.21% now, which is insanely high when u compare this to other high short interest stocks like $wkhs, $blnk, $fuv

The fail to deliver data for $kplt just get updated yesterday, it turns out that on wednesday and thursday there are also >2 millions shares are FTD. and also next week > 1 millions shares 10/26\~28. This feels like $AMC level's FTD when it was gamma squeezed in June. 🚀🚀🚀

1054,Top 5 Trending Stocks on Reddit,"&#x200B;

Hey Everyone,

Wanted to provide an update for the top trending tickers. It is interesting seeing if sentiment is a leading or lagging indicator, as well as the correlation to price. The dashboard is a work in progress but so far it has been useful to track trending stocks and be able to see new tickers on the leaderboard

**Dashboard and Trending Stocks**

Before we jump in, I wanted to provide a bit of background. This is a work in progress so I want to be transparent with how we are tracking these trends. If you have any thoughts on how I can make this more useful please let me know.

**Tracking Mechanics**

* The algorithm pulls data from multiple subreddits using the reddit API. The subreddits it is pulling from are non-stock specific subreddits (i.e. WSB, investing, stockmarket, pennystocks, etc.)
* It then plots mentions with price over a give timeframe (Right now you can look at 72hrs, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month)
* We also display sentiment, number of posts, comments, and upvotes. Sentiment is determined using Spacy and a text classification dictionary

**Future plans**

* **Twitter (Beta)** \- currently testing a way to capture twitter sentiment. I think there is opportunity to follow and track what a number of the largest Fintwit accounts and corelate to the price movement of smaller cap stocks. This is my hypothesis but I need to test it.
* **Social Trend Score -** ultimately we want to be able to identify trending ticker before the price takes off, or before it drops - we are planning on incorporating data from multiple social platform

**Top 5 Trending Stocks on Reddit**

The screenshot is pulled from the Social Sentiment Dashboard and shows the top trending tickers this week.

**$TSLA** **- Tesla, Inc**

TSLA has been steadily climbing all week. A ton of social chatter around Tesla and they have earnings coming up this week. I except this to stay at the top of the leaderboard, at least until the end of the week – regardless if the hit or miss earnings

**$GME – GameStop Corp.**

GME is usually in the top 5 trending stocks on Reddit. No surprise that it is still up here. The price has held steady around the $180 to $185 mark and I expect to see the price hold here due to strong support.

**$PROG - Progenity Inc.**

PROG increased by over 56% this past week. About a week ago, Progenity had announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued 4 patents related to its ingestible technologies for delivery of therapeutics via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This is big news, and why we are seeing an increase in social chatter as well as positive move in stock price.

**$AMC - AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc**

AMC is also usually in the top 5 trending on Reddit. Has a strong following as well as a great MAC specific subreddit. We saw it break the $40 mark last week and I expect to continue to see strong support at this price. I think the overall macros trend of people returning to theatres as well as a number of new movie releases will help propel the AMC stock price.

**$LUV - Southwest Airlines Co**

This is a new one on the leaderboard of trending stocks on Reddit. It’s been hanging around the $50 mark last week but there have been some solid DD posts and discussions around the stock. Some people seem to think it is undervalued at these prices, especially with the return of air travel. They faced some issues with flight cancellations but they should be able to get through this turbulent patch.

Overall these are pretty well known stock on reddit, and have large market caps. It is worth checking out the dedicated subreddits for these tickers if you want to find some more info. Also, you can use the Social Sentiment Dashboard to see all the posts feeding the algo - which allows you to drill into specific ones.

1055,"Geo Group (NYSE-GEO) – Stock trades at $8.20, but is worth $27, $37 and $42 based on various valuation metrics. And the reasons why this deep undervaluation won’t last.","**1. Worth $27 based on earnings. Worth $37 based on FFO.** Some investors consider Geo Group to be a REIT, others do not. Either way, the stock is very inexpensive. If considering Geo Group as a regular company, one should value it on an earnings basis. On an earnings basis, Geo Group trades at 5.8x 2021E earnings of $1.40 per share. However, the average company in the Russell 2000 trades at 19.5x earnings, indicating a fair value of $27 for Geo Group shares. (19.5 x $1.40 = $27.30). And if considering Geo Group as a REIT, one should value it on a P/FFO basis. Geo Group trades at 4.3x 2021E funds from operations (FFO) of $1.90 per share. However, the average ‘other/ diversified’ REIT in the United States trades at 19.8x FFO, indicating a fair value of $37 for Geo Group shares. (19.8 x $1.90 = $37.62). (See Figure 1 below).

**2. Worth $42 based on replacement cost.** As an alternative way to determine the fair value of Geo Group shares, we can look at the replacement cost of Geo Group's assets minus liabilities. To calculate the replacement cost of Geo Group's assets, I researched the construction cost of 25 recently built prisons in the United States. However, because prisons are different sizes, I looked at their construction cost on a per bed basis. The cost was $220,061 per bed. Given Geo Group owns prisons with 55,951 beds, that implies a $12.3 billion total replacement cost. Now that we know the replacement cost of GEO’s facilities, we can calculate the replacement cost of the rest of the company. To do that, we take the value of the company’s facilities, plus the value of the company’s cash and receivables of $1.1 billion, less all liabilities of $3.4 billion. $12.3 + $1.1 - $3.4 = $10.0 billion. Divide $10.0 billion by 122.4 million of shares outstanding = $81.57 per share. But aren’t new facilities worth more than older ones? Yes. GEO’s Secure Services facilities were built, on average, in 1998. Rule of thumb is that industrial building values decline at 2.5% per year. That means $81.57 per share for buildings built in 2020 = $38.64 per share for buildings built in 1998. But also importantly, all of the facilities have been renovated. The renovations would add back at least 10% to the value of the facilities. And $38.64 x 1.10 leaves us with a replacement cost of $42.50 per Geo Group share. (See Figure 1 below).

https://preview.redd.it/qst4mgibzeu71.jpg?width=995&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0621f4a6faa592a72c6315d115818163548837d4

 **3. Reddit users often read the above paragraphs, then they state the following: “Okay I agree with you, GEO is undervalued. But why is it undervalued? And when will it move back to fair value?”** Well, for the past 1.5 years, news headlines constantly stated Geo Group’s earnings are at risk of decline due to the U.S. federal government’s new negative stance towards private prisons. As a result, shares fell 50%. However, news reporters (and in turn some investors) are overlooking the fact that federal facilities only hold 7% of prisoners in the United States. The other 93% of prisoners are held at the state or local levels. So the federal government's stance on private prisons is largely irrelevant, because it only applies to 7% of prisoners. Furthermore, as seen in the picture below, due to: (a) soaring crime rates; (b) soaring police retirements (up 45% yoy for the 12 months ended April 2021); and (c) prison overcrowding, the current federal government’s political aspiration, in addition to being largely irrelevant, is completely unrealistic. This reality - that the federal government’s stance on private prisons is irrelevant - is already positively impacting Geo Group's bottom line. On August 4, 2021, the company reported a significant beat on its Q2 earnings results and raised its full-year earnings guidance from $1.20 to $1.40 per share. And subsequent to the reporting of Q2 results, the company announced it would be re-opening a previously closed facility called Moshannon Correctional. The stock is already up 22% from August 4 to today. \*\*Update: The federal government, despite its bold statements advocating against private prisons for the past year, has quietly admitted it will allow Geo Group to bid on the renewal of the very contracts which the government previously said would no longer be given to the private sector\*\*. It's just a matter of time before the entire market realizes Geo Group's earnings will not decline, but are in fact sustainable. (More likely earnings will increase, at least at the rate of inflation). And companies with sustainable earnings trade at 15-20x earnings, not 5x earnings. This re-rating from 5x P/E to 15-20x P/E supports a 200%-300% increase in Geo Group’s share price from $8.15 per share to between $21 and $28 per share. 

https://preview.redd.it/skor1nnczeu71.jpg?width=1203&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e82f6a228e715df4dddc67d9e8f7c6db7dfbf42

**4. Don’t wait because momentum is building**. First, we have legendary investment guru, Dr. Michael Burry, buying $20 million of shares of Geo Group between April and June 2021. He also tweeted about the stock in June: [https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1405661364689965056/photo/1](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1405661364689965056/photo/1). Second, we have large scale insider buying from CEO Zoley who purchased $1.1 million worth of shares at $6.75 per share in June. Third, a whale investor just bought $1 million worth of Geo Group options with a strike price of $12 and March 2022 expiry date. This $1 million investment goes to $0 if GEO shares don’t rise to $12 by March. Typically, whale investors don’t make those big bets unless they are almost certain of something. And fourth, Geo Group has its own Reddit group of 1,200 members, up from 200 in June. One posted a billboard in New York, promoting the stock. (see it below and here: [https://twitter.com/Nasimul1978/status/1413618508609560583?s=20](https://twitter.com/Nasimul1978/status/1413618508609560583?s=20)). However, Geo hasn't even been mentioned in the most important Reddit group (Wall Street Bets) yet, because its market cap of $1.05 billion falls just below the forum's $1.25 billion requirement. What happens when the only meme stock with strong fundamentals makes its way onto this aggressive short squeeze subreddit? 

https://preview.redd.it/jzxz86tdzeu71.jpg?width=806&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1057893f32a657e5070fdfa9243eb1105e139020

**5. If the above isn’t reason enough to buy, consider this question: Is Geo Group the single best short squeeze candidate out of all meme stocks?** As seen in the scatter plot below, because of Geo Group's relatively small market capitalization ($1.0 billion) and high short interest (22%), it is as likely as any other meme stock to get squeezed. However, there is an additional factor that needs to be considered, not displayed by the chart. That factor is Geo Group's deep undervaluation. I believe this undervaluation has two important implications:

\--- **a) Geo Group could triple based on fundamentals alone, trapping shorts**. In other words, a massive squeeze could happen, independent of Reddit/Wall Street Bets.

\--- **b) Reddit users can risk far more capital on Geo Group vs other meme stocks.** Only 3 of the 25 most talked about meme stocks/short squeeze candidates have earnings. Because Geo Group trades far ***below*** its fair value (while every other meme stock trades far ***above*** their fair values), Reddit users can risk far more capital investing in Geo Group. Looking at the chart below, which meme stock are you more comfortable owning? I know I’d be as comfortable investing $15,000 into a stock that trades at 5.8x earnings as I would be investing $5,000 in a stock with no earnings. Bottom line: APES have triple the ammo.

https://preview.redd.it/5sjnck2fzeu71.jpg?width=1105&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57466ca3cd9178756bd23036bc8b1b8e2b884c83

**6. How high could shares go on a short squeeze? + Conclusion.** GameStop’s market capitalization reached a high of $35 billion when the stock peaked at $483 per share. AMC reached a similar level. That level translates into a $292 share price for Geo Group (see Moonshot Potential column in Figure #1 above). Under normal market conditions, the probability of a short squeeze is low. However, in the past six months of the ongoing speculative mania, short squeezes have been common (ie. GME, AMC, CARV, CLOV). As discussed in paragraph #5 above, Geo Group’s potential to squeeze may be the highest among all meme stocks. And importantly, as proven by the deep due diligence valuation work completed in this post, instead of losing 50-70% of your capital while waiting for the squeeze (like with AMC, GME etc), you could very well be making a 100%-200% return while waiting.

# If you understand skew it will help you understand why options are being priced the way they are. 

It opens many doors for trading opportunities.

Skew is used to infer the implied distribution of the stock in the future. One thing to remember is that options are based on the future distribution of a stock. 

# Before we jump into it.. we first we need to understand some of the basics. 

**Take a look at the Graph below**. 

It is a chart that shows how often different returns happen for a stock. What do we notice about it?

&#x200B;

[X axis is daily returns for a stock. Y axis is how frequently that daily return occurs.](https://preview.redd.it/kttyf87qcfu71.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=96e94a82b215107085e8bf3390b412636297e173)

We can see that the *most frequent* return is 0%, and the likelihood of a big move up **or** down is even (same frequency of a 5% up move vs a 5% down move). We call this a ""normal distribution"".

If we looked at a stocks returns over the last year and saw that it was normally distributed, what conclusions could we draw? Well, we could say that :

&#x200B;

1. Most of the time the stock will move about 0%
2. There is an equal chance of a large up move and a large down move

&#x200B;

Easy right? But here's the thing..

# Stock returns do not typically look like this. 

You ever hear the saying: ""***Stocks go up like an escalator, and down like an elevator****?*""

I'm sure most of us have heard that one before. What is this telling us? It tells us that stocks tend to go up slowly, and then crash down quickly.

OR...

***Most of the time, we see a small move up in stocks. Occasionally, we see a large move down.***

Because of this, the distribution of a stocks returns aren't typically normally distributed. The look more like this.

&#x200B;

[X axis is daily returns for a stock. Y axis is how frequently that daily return occurs.](https://preview.redd.it/fouttvv0dfu71.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5318dd69ce9e71e7d93c0195ea2fe2acb2d0a304)

&#x200B;

We can see on the graph above that most of the time we have frequent small up moves,  and infrequent large down moves. The top of the line is slightly to the right of 0, and the left side of the graph is a bit more elevated than the right side. 

Since this is how a typical stocks returns look, what conclusions can we draw?

&#x200B;

1. The most frequent daily return for a stock is a small up move. 
2. Big down moves happen with more frequency than a big up move.

&#x200B;

**As we can see, the distribution is** ***skewed.***

A skew in a distribution is when one of the tails is longer than the other. If we look at graph above we can see that the tail on the left is skewed. This is known as a negative skew since it has a long tail in the negative direction. 

If the big positive moves had more frequency than the big negative moves, we would call it a positive skew.

# An interesting question..

*Given this is the typical distribution for a stock returns, and knowing that options are used to make a bet on the future volatility of a stock, how would we expect options to be priced, puts vs calls?* 

(Remember, options try to price the future distribution for a stocks returns).

# An even more interesting answer..

*We would expect to see puts more expensive than the calls on equities because* ***the risk is to the downside****.* 

Let's break this down. 

Skew is the difference in implied volatilities between the out of the money puts relative to the out of the money calls. **It shows us where the demand/supply is located on the chain.** 

For example:

On a $90 stock you might see something like the $100 call is trading at 40% but the $80 put is trading 60%. 

What this is telling us is that the *put options are more expensive than the call options*. 

**Most people who are long equity look to hedge their exposure to a crash by buying puts, so you would typically see high demand for puts with relatively low supply.** 

# This makes sense right? Let's think about the S&P500 options for a second. 

The whole world is basically long equity. So where do they go to hedge? Typically Pension funds and the like will be buying puts or writing calls on something like the S&P500. This creates huge demand on the put side, and lots of supply on the call side. 

The odds are we have small moves upwards, but if there’s going to be a blowout, it will likely be to the downside. Protection, or exposure to that, costs money!

# This difference in price for calls and puts is what we call skew.

Looking at the skew tells us 2 main things

&#x200B;

1. What direction the market thinks the most likely move is
2. What direction the market thinks the big move risk is

The key word here is that skew tells us the ***market implied*** likelihood of different moves.

This is important to note because the way we make big bucks as traders is by identifying areas we disagree with the market and trading them accordingly.

It is important to understand what the market thinks is going to happen so you can compare that with your view on the market. 

# Let's pull up the skew for SPY so we can see what it actually looks like. 

&#x200B;

[Skew for SPY 19\/10\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/zoyl48bqtfu71.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=36a00b60285b995e2938a7ee2187697dcf9a5fda)

Basically, on the X axis we have the call deltas, and on the Y axis we have implied volatility. 

or in simpler terms

*The left side is OTM Calls, the middle is ATM calls/puts, the right side is OTM Puts.*

note: Some softwares will plot it the other way around. 

By visualizing this, we can quickly see how the different portions of the option chain are priced relative to each other. 

As we can see, the OTM Puts are higher than the OTM Calls. This is what we would refer to as  ""put skew"".

This is what we would typically see for a stock. 

Once again, this is because they typically make small frequent moves to the upside, and then large infrequent moves to the downside.

# Does a stock's skew always look like this?

The market is alive, so things change. 

&#x200B;

* Market conditions change
* Stocks have big news releases
* Insiders know about a buyout before it happens
* WSB tries to squeeze a stock
* A big court case is about to get settled
* A new drug is awaiting approval for a pharmaceutical company

# Depending on how different variables in the market change, the skew changes to reflect what the market expects to happen in the future. 

If a stock gets squeezed and jumps up 100%, what is the skew most likely to look like? 

We can take a guess by answering the following two questions:

1. What is the most likely move in the future?
2. Where is the risk in the future?

In the case of these meme stocks that get squeezed, the most likely thing to happen is that it moves down a bit. The **risk** is that it keeps moving up by a huge amount. So the skew might look something like this:

&#x200B;

[AMC 30DTE Skew 03\/03\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/i0x4k6g0xfu71.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3c29362006502b6a8c3949c5a6f52f13855a992b)

As you can see, on AMC, the skew was heavily to the call side! But is it always like this?

&#x200B;

[Green line is AMC 30dte skew in November 2020. Blue line is AMC 30dte Skew in March 2021](https://preview.redd.it/kcumzu8gxfu71.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7bbb49d29c98272825072f03faace23ede4ac479)

Here is a prime example of the skew changing! Before the whole meme stock craze, AMC had a lot of put skew. This makes sense, because the *risk* was that the stock would go down a lot. 

But after it started squeezing, things changed.  The risk was now that it moons! So the options market changed to reflect this. 

**The OTM Calls went from being cheaper than the OTM puts, to being more expensive!**

# Over time, the skew changes to reflect the market's view of what could happen to a stock between now and the expiration you are looking at.

Yep, each expiration has it's own skew. This is because we are looking *across the strikes, and every expiration has its own strikes!* I know, it can be a bit confusing.. but once you wrap your head around the concept of skew you will be able to understand the market a whole lot better. 

# How can we take advantage of the skew? 

There are so many different ways to trade the skew. Risk reversals, spreads, selling or buying options.. 

In short, we can trade the skew when we disagree with it.

Here are 2 example of how we can trade the skew (there are more, but here's two):

# 1) We can trade a change in the skew

Here is a time series of the 30 day skew for TSLA:

&#x200B;

[TSLA 30dte skew over last 30 days. the higher the number, the more put skew. The lower the number, the more call skew. 0 would be flat skew.](https://preview.redd.it/ksluqgzwfgu71.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dedbe514e4968e099b43dde844f2f44b1bf3cd7f)

&#x200B;

What can we see? We can see that TSLA put skew got REALLY steep last week. The highest it's been in 2 years. We could have taken a trade here that bet on it coming back down to a more typical level. 

The optimal trade here would have been a **risk reversal**, since it would have made money on the skew coming back down AND on the positive deltas!

# How to find trades like this: 

The first thing you will want to do is scan for stocks that have elevated skew. You can use filters like Skew Rank (It's like IV rank, but for skew) or just ""Skew"".

Then I will look at the skew time series (like the picture above) and use that to help me gauge what the change has been relative to what we see in the past. 

From there, I will look at the skew for different expirations to see where it is most out of line. 

Once you have found a stock where the skew has changed drastically (to the upside or the downside), the second thing you do is ask yourself the question: **why is it happening?**

If we can understand why, we can then determine the *rationality* behind it. Are people overly hyped about something? Is there too much fear right now? 

If we think the market is overreacting to something (or under reacting), we can put on a trade like this!

&#x200B;

# 2) We can take advantage of the skew to get a high R:R trade

Something I like to do is trade unbalanced flys into steep call skew. It's basically the best lotto tickets you can get in the market.

**Check this out:**

I did a scan today for stocks with expensive call skew. COIN came up on my radar. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dgqecqodcgu71.png?width=1966&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8207c2a24cad0c95c9f302175ccad81831059ce

Here's what I saw:

&#x200B;

[Relative to historic skew, it is now the most skewed to the call side that it has ever been!](https://preview.redd.it/pholjik88gu71.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c04f09506cfedcae308433fa3da4837032c61123)

&#x200B;

[Looking at a few different expirations, it seems the skew is steepest in the near dated options \(green line\).](https://preview.redd.it/y4gjejlscgu71.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6819fdf5b3b0fd38ce2089280621f00d1d872d89)

COIN skew is at the highest call skew it has seen!

This is pretty crazy, the market is pricing in a lot of risk to the upside here.

Now let's say I am bullish on COIN. I think it will rally another 5% in the coming week.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3oidaexc8gu71.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0b69dbfb1cd9205d2e69ed00c7c9a1d142bb5ac

What we did here was trade a 1-3-2 fly *into* the call skew. 

**We are paying $65 per fly, with a max payout of $935 each!**

We bought a call at-the-money, and financed it by selling 3 out-the-money calls! We then went even further out and bought 2 as a hedge, giving us this nice risk defined trade. 

These are my favourite little YOLOs. Low risk, super high reward. 

I like to do them around earnings especially, and sometimes you can find wild trades like this one!

# Conclusion

Skew just shows us the balance in supply/demand for calls and puts. Are people more hungry for calls? Or more hungry for puts? 

When we can understand this, a lot of doors open. But remember this: Knowing skew isn't an edge. It's just a feature of the options market that we need to understand if we want to be able to understand what we are seeing and create better ideas of our own. 

# Skew helps us see what is actually happening. And by understanding why it's happening, we can uncover some great trading opportunities.",2021-10-19 15:03:31

1059,"How to find ""rabbit"" or identify potential MEME-stocks."," I will try to find commonalities in the dynamics of GME and AMC stocks.

According to my observations in meme stocks, there is one common trait. Determining the continued success of such a stock.

A few months before the upside play began, there was significant volume in these stocks equal to or greater than the total shares outstanding, which passed on a still small rise.

It seems to me that at that particular moment a huge short position was opened on that stock, and the paper became charged to the upside, even before it became a meme stock.

So there would have to be a margin call price for such a short. It must exceed the average opening price by a certain amount. A breakout of this price implies that more stock is needed from the bear, but the short is huge and the market just runs out of stock. This leads to a sharp closing of short positions, the so-called short squeese.

Of course there are plenty of stocks with such volume dynamics in the market, and not all of them become memes. But everyone who becomes a meme usually has such a sign.

1061,"$RDBX: A strong value play with a forward P/E of 2.3, float of 2M, huge brand awareness with a promising pivot to digital","RDBX (formerly SGAM) is debuting today and I believe it represents a strong investment opportunity. Most people seem to be excited about the small float (2M shares: [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacstocks/comments/qdvrlo/comment/hhp7oy8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), but that's only part of the story. The most exciting thing to me is that at $10, it's valued at a forward P/E of 2.3 and has a brand awareness that rivals the most well-known companies in the world.

**Redbox's Financials and a Forward P/E of 2.3**

Here are Redbox's financials:  [https://imgur.com/DtQRLFU](https://imgur.com/DtQRLFU)

|Year|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Rev ($M)**|829|546|400|bgbgy|1112|
|**Ebitda ($M)**|196|114|40|193|237|
|**Free Cash Flow ($M)**|163|93|53|173|222|
|**New Movies in Theaters**|140|69|59|140|140|

The most important takeaway is that Redbox is highly profitable and their 2020/2021 rev declines are directly correlated with the dramatically lower amount of new movie releases due to COVID. If you expect the amount of new movies in theaters to return to normal in 2022 and beyond, you should be bullish on Redbox.

Just look at this [graph](https://imgur.com/a/uAVc0Lz) to see how closely their legacy business (physical rentals) revenue tracks with the number of new movie releases per year.

At $10, Redbox is valued at a market cap of $447M and enterprise value of $693M. In 2019, they generated a revenue of $829M and EBITDA of $196M (83% of that being FCF). In 2020 and 2021, the revenue dropped to $546M and $400M, with EBITDA at $114M and $40M respectively. Most people will assume that 2020/2021 dropped because Redbox suddenly fell out of favor, but the actual explanation is that the number of new movies released in 2020/21 were dramatically less than in normal years due to COVID. The average person on Reddit probably has super-fast internet, but there are many rural places in the US that don't have access to fast-internet and rely on Redbox for lag-free movie consumption. Additionally, Redbox's rentals are priced at $2 whereas the equivalent digital rental would be $6, making it a strong option for value-shoppers.

In 2019 there were 140 new movies, 2020 there were 68 new movies, 2021 there were 59 new movies, and in 2022 it is expected to return to a normal level of 140 new movies.

Can you name another company in the stock market that's trading at a forward 2.3 P/E with a reasonable expectation to sustain or even exceed that in later years?

**Redbox's Brand Exposure**

Just about everyone knows Redbox and has positive feelings associated with the brand (cheap family movie nights). This is backed up by the fact that they have 40 million loyalty members, 43 million app downloads with a 4.8 rating, and 40,000 kiosks (more locations than Starbucks and McDonalds combined).

Their brand awareness makes me think that this will do on despac, as having a well-known brand is key to generating retail interest as we are well aware with companies like GME, AMC, and even recently WeWork and infamously, DWAC. Throwing out GME and AMC may sound like a pump, but the similarities are undeniable with Redbox having a movie rental disc business that is perceived to be dying. Redbox's profitability and valuation are way more attractive than GME and AMC ever did though even at their lowest points.

**Pivot to Digital**

Redbox's fast-growing digital business by itself would likely justify its entire valuation if it was any other SPAC. In 2019, their digital business had $20M rev, 2020 had $40M rev, and $2021 is expected to have $55M. In 2022, they are very bullish with their projections: $193M. Who knows if they'll reach that, but it's clearly the strategic focus of the company. Their 40 million loyalty members are usually late tech adopters, and so Redbox has a promising opportunity to capitalize on a large segment of people that have not been already bought into other streaming apps. Redbox adds unique value to these types of customers by making the experience simple for them--combining various streaming apps/services into one single Redbox digital platform. This way, users don't have to download and sign into many different apps to see all of the available content.

Redbox's digital strategy is [multi-faceted](https://imgur.com/Xr21bmM): they are bundling various streaming services together (Showtime, Starz, AMC, Paramount+, etc.) through its own app and taking a cut, give its 40 million customers the opportunity to rent movies digitally through its Google Play-like store, and provide free ad-supported TV and movies on its streaming platform.

1062,The power of cult: Why I think DWAC is primed to move higher and so will other similar cult stocks,"Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?

Well, it’s now the largest company in the world.

The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. 

DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.

Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.

And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!

Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.

Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.

I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.

AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.😂
INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.

But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.

It’s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).

Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely.


Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?
If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. 
(I am not saying you shouldn’t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)

As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.

With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.

TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.


Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.",2021-10-25 11:10:37

I focus on PALI. It's not because I believe in the company. Could care less to be honest about good fundamentals. Bankrupt companies run all the time. Scams go on insane multiples.

  
I focus on PALI because of the raw numbers only. The tendency of a fund to suppress in order to acquire shares at batgain prices, only to deliberately run a stock when they are content. I am a trust guy. I trust a fund to do whatever it takes to make a run for profit

  
I first found PALI doing deep ftd digging. I screened for low volume, high decline stuff. Stuff that was down to all time lows. I came across at least a dozen or so that have already done runs upward of 50% or more. Even prog was one I found in that list. Usmc too. 

  
PALI peaked my interest for having just soooo many ftd's. Way too many for a low float. 2.29 million? That's insane. It's like amc before it ran. And the borrow rate is just stupid high....so when I looked at why the borrow rate could be so high still....I just did the basic math of ftd's being entered at $3.88/share vs todays sp of $2.62. Decline of 67%. Borrow rate always just a few % above the decline. Too coincidental for me. Seems the 20/50ma has a small factor as well

  
Altium really got lucky on their deal with PALI. But if retail catches wind of their plan moreso, it could prove interesting. I suspect that on level 2 data, that buy order for 90k shares or so at $2.59/share is actually Altiums order. Acquiring shares as they punish increases with shorts. Playing it down just to play it up. Word is that Altium will be able to exercise their warrants at whatever average share price is set next week.

  
The only reason PALI was able to be suppressed friday was it's lack of volume. That new pr dropped, and PALI was taking off. Was climbing to break $3 fast on barely 100k volume. At 1 million to maybe 2 million volume at most, there would be no way in hell Altium could suppress it.

  
So the theory prevails, that if retail does in fact run on PALI, whatever increase is met and held will only increase the warrants cost. Basically, the higher PALI goes, the higher cost to Altium, and the higher the run in PALI for the potential shareholder.

&#x200B;

  
Staddann's RAW NUMBER DD

  
I've been in this stock since before the merger and the action here is rather strange.

  
What I believe Altium is doing is Warrant Short Sale. Buyer (Altium) holds the right to exercise warrants, but doesn't do so. Instead, they sell short the stock and use the warrants as insurance. So they write certificates against those warrants for shorted shares and also why they can keep the FTD's down as they are cumulative. If you look at the numbers of FTD's especially May 13 (over 2m), that number is ""reset"" the day after. This means they've ""found"" the shares to cover for the FTD's and as mentioned above made certificates against warrants they have the right to exercise later - Look below. This is from the latest S-3 from July 30. \*\*I've put in the ""Edit"" parts for better understanding.\*\\\* "" Further, the Equity Warrants include a provision such that, beginning six months after the closing of the Merger (Edit: close of merger was April 27. 2021), if the volume weighted average price of Company Common Stock is less than the then-applicable exercise price (Edit: $3.88) for five consecutive trading days, the holder of the Equity Warrant shall be entitled to receive 1.0 share of Company Common Stock for each share underlying the Equity Warrants being exercised thereunder in a cashless exercise. The exercise price and the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Bridge Warrants and Equity Warrants will also be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock splits, dividends or distributions or other similar transactions as well as fundamental transactions. Prior to the effectiveness of the Waiver and Amendment Agreement (described below), two Resets occurred and the two Bridge Warrants and the Equity Warrants were exercisable for up to 429,446, 429,446, and 5,303,568 shares, respectively, each at an exercise price of $3.88 per share, and two potential Resets remained.""

It's easy to understand why Altium would manipulate the stock. So, there you have it. The who, what, where, when, and how PALI is manipulated. Now it lays in retails hands. Will retail push back? Or will predatory hedge funds win?

1069,Best European Brokers,"Hi guys,

I am from Bulgaria( not relative to Vlad Tenev I swear), Europe and I want to open a stock broker account.  So I was wondering what experience do you have with yours.  What are the fees, can you buy fractional shares and what is the minimum deposit.  Is the ui beginner friendly?I am not going to invest in meme stocks but I prefer a broker that didn’t restrict buying Gme and Amc in January. Also can I buy that really famous volatile asset created by Satoshi Nakamoto which name I can’t say in this subreddit without breaking the rules.

I read that Degiro is pretty good, those who use it - what is your opinion. Edit: Degiro is not available in Bulgaria so what other brokers do you recommend 

Thanks in advance!",2021-10-30 08:12:20
1070,"Expected Moves this Week, AMC, Roku, Moderna, DraftKings, Peloton, Square and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% (or $7.40) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY just under **$460** that corresponds to just above **$464** on the upside and around **$455** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16.20, up slightly from the week before. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

Options are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **1.7%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $455 and $464 to see Max Gain:

## In the News

The FDA gave to go-ahead for a lower dose Covid vaccine from Pfizer (PFE) for ages 5-12. Moderna (MRNA) announced that the FDA needed more time to review its vaccine for the same age group. Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.

### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

The *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all had a fun weekend! We’ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we’ve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though that’s not to say that there isn’t chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round. Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, we’ll still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies who’ve already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. There’s no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **$PINS is inefficiently priced.** $PINS has a priced move of 10.5% but a historical move of 15%, meaning we have edge in this trade. Pinterest is a historically aggressive mover, and that’s only going to be amplified due to the awkward resolution of the Paypal deal, leading me to believe we’re going to have another large move this quarter. $PINS reports on Thursday, meaning that the options will be even cheaper due to theta, moving the 10.5% priced move closer to 8% or 9%, giving us added margins of safety.  For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to the link in the point above.$SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity. So do $PENN and $DKNG.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you’re bullish or bearish on *either company*, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we’ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me!

1073,"This week's hot stocks, high IV list, top & worst performers of the week.","Hello fellow investors,

I've been contributing weekly providing insights into tickers that are taking off and overly hyped or have some opportunities to buy the dip (or sell cash-secured-puts). Saw some good action this week in various names, lets take a look.

&#x200B;

# Too Hot To Touch

A couple names come to mind this week after trading absolutely ridiculous ranges. These names are currently in my “too hot to touch” category even as enticing as all the screen-shotted gains popping up on Reddit and Twitter might be. The two tickers are Bakkt (BKKT) and Lucid Motors (LCID).

&#x200B;

**Bakkt (BKKT)**

https://preview.redd.it/nl17z8qy8ww71.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d944ee8ec4c09a2d46fea5f2eb47b3e5af72764b

&#x200B;

**Lucid (LCID)**

https://preview.redd.it/pekaf93z9ww71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc0b2d825d8fef22d95f669ac3535d3627e439ed

Both of these names have entered into my signature “red zone” areas where stock price has appreciated over 50% in a short amount of time. BKKT is actually up roughly 300%, while LCID is up nearly 80%. Not to say these names aren’t going to be solid trades in the future, but my opinion, and what I am doing, is to let them cool off rather than FOMO at the top. Preservation of capital is the name of the game.

&#x200B;

# Best & Worst Performers Last Week

https://preview.redd.it/adoyx1e0aww71.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89e3a7b3f097ec2bcebf94bad1d5b5da0a98651a

https://preview.redd.it/f6r4wql0aww71.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1b48bffa31e880d88d877c117025b708df17e473

Here’s a list of stocks that performed abnormally out of their 90-day trading range. The list includes my own personal list of “popular” stocks that are usually small cap or greater in size and more on the well-known side.

&#x200B;

I use this list to either:

* Buy the dip (or sell CSPs) on stocks that have had an unusually bad performance.
* Take some off the table from the top performers if I am already holding a position.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# High IV List

https://preview.redd.it/rfovx5g1aww71.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b28e0449e11c71c9abe99fa9ff5a370fecf220e5

In the following sheet of high IV stocks I included the Enterprise Value (EV) to Market Cap (MC) (in the “EV/MC” column) because it allows me to see how “risky” the play is. In short, Enterprise Value is a measure of a company’s total value and is used as a comprehensive alternative to market capitalization. The average is usually 1:1, but a higher EV/MC signifies the company’s health is OK.

I’ve also included RSI to see overbought/oversold levels and the “ATM 30D IV” is the 30-day IV for the ticker, in percentage. The list is sorted from highest IV to lowest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**What do I like from this list?**

* AMC: Earnings are coming up Tuesday after market close. Although the AMC share price has been in limbo for some months now IV is still very high (113%). The risk of poor earnings is always there, but the amount of premium to collect will off-set some losses should the stock tank. Nov 19, $31 strike puts still offer solid premium and provide cushion for over 20% decline from the current share price.
* LILM:  Lilium is a transportation company that develops electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft for use in high-speed air transport system for people and goods. This is somewhat of a new industry and a lot more can be said about the company instead of what I’ll write here in two sentences. I’m looking to build my position through CSPs and hold shares if assigned. After a recent dip IV has spiked and is sitting at 105%.
* FVRR: Fiverr had a down week last week due to their competitor Upwork (UPWK) announcing poor earnings results. IMO this is a risky play, but FVRR is a leader for the gig economy industry and entering a starter position may not be a bad play. They will report earnings in two weeks time.
* GLBE: Growth stock Global-E is trading back to June levels without much change in fundamentals. I will be using this dip to sell CSPs while IV is high. They report earnings in two weeks.

&#x200B;

# Hot Stocks Under-The-Radar

A couple stocks were picking up momentum by means of social chatter this week. What I found were Revlon (REV) and Mountain Pass Materials (MP).

&#x200B;

**Revlon (REV)**

https://preview.redd.it/4rhxneg2aww71.png?width=2578&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7225b33bd19d9a4e8c8d436283044af3be5c9fe

I caught a slight uptick in Revlon chatter this week. Nothing substantial, but when I looked at the chart I saw the consolidating base it formed on a decrease in trading volume. I wouldn’t bet anything big on this play as I haven’t done my DD on this company, but I might enter a starter position before they report earnings in two weeks.

&#x200B;

**Mountain Pass (MP)**

https://preview.redd.it/5tkcocb2aww71.png?width=2578&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39bbb1ead859b6dc004f7d71ba5fc0506e6e2a3b

MP dropped last week due to a short report released by Grizzly Research. I read the report and while they do offer some insight as to why they think this company is not what it seems, my opinion is that they are wrong. MP was down almost 20% at one point after the report was released, but has since made a recovery and ended the week -10%. Short interest for MP stands at 12% and has the potential for a short-squeeze should the company produce something substantial at earnings.",2021-10-31 22:27:07

1079,Can Wallstreetbets beat the market? - I analyzed 20MM+ comments in 2021 to see if you should pay attention to the stock picks made in wsb. Here are the results.," 

>Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal

This is how they define themselves. [Wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) is a community that has gained a following of 11MM+ members over the years. As much as it’s fun to follow their ups and downs and the laugh-out-loud memes that they post, the question in the back of everyone’s mind is: **Is there really more to WSB than just the memes and jokes?** Do they have real insights?

In this analysis, I try to use historical data about the conversations on WSB to see if there’s a method to the [madness and chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg85H26wyLk) and [GME hype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze): to see if **we can beat the market by using the stock picks made on WSB.** After all,

https://preview.redd.it/tkrcc2xsh6x71.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=74efcafaeaf65ca2151b35c1e8544e87fa8aa8bb

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/exloyxuuh6x71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47b3c20ac4c2f8bbb743e0eae0be056aeaad5710)

**Data**

Reddit’s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20.

The summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/trqixawuh6x71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=25c0821ba3dda1eb4c76c10ad2b4301b10b05616)

**Analysis**

Ahh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.

So what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \[2\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.

Considering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a. One Week

b. One Month

c. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)

The benchmark for comparison is SPY\[3\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/jqpax2xuh6x71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c6709f09968d98dd0de37e85e49e1816c2e29aa)

**Results**

Before we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**

[ 10 months of Wallstreetbets in 3 minutes ](https://reddit.com/link/ql3gg7/video/fgmsogzyh6x71/player)

 *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/) 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/90xrkbf2i6x71.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=be4656f06da426f9362e469b5076a76a77de27e7)

We would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \[4\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[5\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays).

So, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjwlugp3i6x71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88b7008b6dc5bfea73cfe2f9be5be0eb021ca1b8)

Would you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.

But keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/m6dlg6e4i6x71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a804d63fb4e1e7c7ac5a5afabc6f2e75b493d536)

GME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \[6\].

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.

https://preview.redd.it/lxryhi65i6x71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=970eeb4955c9178afae9118c6059972a4c7a52d0

Unsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/d7nn1gj6i6x71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63c9106ecf9197a44ffe3956c974ca9cbe02eef2)

For every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.

But what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?

https://preview.redd.it/ylhpu4e7i6x71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f60d121e8d2e35006cb6213e862f33765766e766

Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \[7\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ej6f9rxuh6x71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc0324cbc84e6300ffaaa13766c77ba0b50eb487)

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it’s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.
* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.
* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works — stay tuned!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hkyn8wzuh6x71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a352914f020956024a5a944df2909e2a81dbd050)

**Conclusion**

Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with

>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!

I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***

Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).

Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.

\[2\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.

\[3\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.

\[4\] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.

\[5\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

\[6\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns is [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).

\[7\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.",2021-11-02 08:49:34

1083,Anyone invested in this stock? Shares of Avis double in single day as huge earnings beat sends hedge fund shorts running,"Car rental stock Avis Budget surged Tuesday after the company reported a stronger-than-expected third quarter that sparked massive trading volume. The company reported $10.74 in per-share earnings for the third quarter, beating a Refinitiv consensus estimate by more than $4. Revenue also topped expectations. Avis Budget’s board also authorized an additional $1 billion in share buybacks. The stock closed 108.3% higher Tuesday at $185.7%. Trading in the stock was halted multiple times Tuesday morning, and it was up more than 200% for the day at one point.

Vague comments on the conference call by executives about increasing purchases of electric cars for its fleet appeared to add juice to the rally, as chief executive officer Joseph Ferraro said the company would play a “big role” in the growth of electric cars in the U.S., according to a transcript of the earnings call from FactSet. A large amount of bets against the stock likely contributed to the size and speed of the day’s move.

Ahead of the earnings report, 20.5% of the float of Avis Budget’s stock was sold short, according to FactSet, an abnormally high number. When a stock rises, short-sellers are forced to cover their positions by buying shares, creating more upward pressure on the stock price. This is called a “short squeeze.” Some short squeezes have been accelerated this year due to retail traders who use social media sites like Reddit’s WallStreetBets. Heavy interest from smaller investors helped to drive dramatic moves in stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment earlier this year.

Brokerage firm TD Ameritrade instituted trading restrictions on the stock on Tuesday, including limiting certain options strategies and blocking short-selling. The U.S. rental car industry has been in a state of upheaval since the start of the pandemic. Travel demand plummeted in 2020, leading Avis-rival Hertz to file for bankruptcy protection, and production delays for automakers have led to a shortage of available cars in 2021 as travelers have hit the road.

Shares of Hertz were also the subject of a trading frenzy earlier this year. The company has since emerged from bankruptcy.

1085,Can Wallstreetbets beat the market? - I analyzed 20MM+ comments made on WSB in 2021 to see if you should pay attention to their stock picks. Here are the results.,">Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal

This is how wallstreetbets define their community. For those who don’t know, [r/wallstreetbets](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwtUMtuxCAM_JrlGGHIJuyBQy_9DcTDydImEIHTNH9fslvJsqXxYzzjLeGcy6kJK7EtVzJ0bqgTHnVBIixsr1hMDJoF3QdQd8ViNVNBXG1cNJUd2ba7JXpLMadrUo7AB2BPzfsH-GFSSsLgAiKHyXnugPuHF_w-vgntHiImjxp_sJw5IVv0k2irN_lxE58tjuPoCoYQqfN5bUC5QLssldof5JBqA1jUggsALgFkrwTvRKewhwEnMapJKCuxm3Yn5G_GW8_XWXR1d5Ws_77usqJTdl-5tt58iXuBTZtpdd1TpNNgsm7B8JZNb9deRpgZE5bmZjCWNAzyPigFnCv1r7L50ksJfJQP1lhDbltJr7Z8t-8xUVxb-gNKZ4d5) is one of the biggest stock market communities in the world having more than 11MM+ members. It’s where millions are made and lost every day on outrageous bets and the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins.

Whether it’s for the insane YOLOs posted every day, or breaking Robinghood with infinite leverage plays, or the legendary short-squeeze involving GME, wallstreetbets is where the action goes down! [This video](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkMtuwyAQRb_GLC1exmTBolJVddF_sACPHRIbIhjq-u9LEmk0I81Dd-7xFmFN-TQIBckjFZzwfICJcJQNECGTWiBPYTZkNnJmetAklGnJALsNm8FcgTyq24K3GFJ8boqRUcXI1VCpOOWLVxe5MCqkH9UgF7dQf9FiGPxb0NY5QPRg4BfymSKQzVwRH6UTHx3_anEcR3-mitVB79P-7Fj01058_Xbi87bq4Zur4_y5d1xZN_mrjRG2NnJhdakUEkz7g7UXGBNSc9rzXoNkChY-6oVrK6BfquPiL0En6b7yvlRX0Pr7U5BkE5O7pdJm69P2q9lcT63uNQY8J4jWbTC_geCb5wvRtEKE3DjPk0XDlBiU1oxSrce3_0ZMCsHoKC6kqc6pXUWz23wHLBAx7C39A5NMj1I) sums up the absolute chaos that r/wallstreetbets is.

But what we are interested in is to see if **we can beat the** **market** **by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets!** After all,

https://preview.redd.it/ibv9sp3idbx71.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a22f76780633ea928c7326892cb4c8c89d39f18

**Data**

Reddit’s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20.

The summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/olsk3rzidbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=76172bc2f56f1d821f913a691b91bc11b1157620)

**Analysis**

Ahh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.

So what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \[2\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.

Considering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a. One Week

b. One Month

c. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)

The benchmark for comparison is SPY\[3\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9cp7di0jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d8cfef79e99ca297254a953f76a70bca2603d82)

**Results**

Before we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**

https://reddit.com/link/qlsbb9/video/n6jlnnvldbx71/player

 *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/)

We would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \[4\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[5\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays).

So, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bfkgenaodbx71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=074023fb386dbaccddd6cf0e19db0803bbf7a8be)

Would you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.

But keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ye4hbj8pdbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1b355705e126b1433f4b0694c47845a690a524a)

GME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \[6\].

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.

https://preview.redd.it/faw73z8qdbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc5379bca49d109b99d6dd5db6b82a9561e4f1e0

Unsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3tu6gfqrdbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54e87543d30b75e6e89d395dc2b248b9a9997e68)

For every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.

But what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?

https://preview.redd.it/n95yi6lsdbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b16f7db3bec6721c3779f53aec0beed8bf541750

Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \[7\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/03em191jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2847101d7014c17c9d95b33c503f287bed5e409a)

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it’s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.
* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.
* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works — stay tuned!

**Conclusion**

Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with

>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!

I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***

Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).

Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.

\[2\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.

\[3\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.

\[4\] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.

\[5\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

\[6\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns is [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).

\[7\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.

1093,Will Macy's $M become a meme stock?,"Is $Macy's $M about to become a Meme stock? It was mentioned by Matt Levine, Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-04/macy-s-targeted-by-meme-activists?sref=pPe6wEud](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-04/macy-s-targeted-by-meme-activists?sref=pPe6wEud)).  

An activist investor, NuOrion Advisors, is pushing $macys $M to showcase Tesla, Lucid and Rivian models in their stores and properties and to take payment with digital coins ([https://nuorionadvisorsbusiness.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/letter-to-m-chairman-3.pdf](https://nuorionadvisorsbusiness.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/letter-to-m-chairman-3.pdf)). 

Can $M become a Tesla / EV / digital coin payment play? I'm thinking about how Hertz has done after announcing the purchase of Teslas for their fleet. 

$M has tremendous momentum, up steadily since spring 2020, but still cheap and less than its pre-Covid highs of $72 in 2015 compared to $31.34 yesterday. It is already a reopening play. Macy's earnings has a tail wind since, with the supply chain shortage, they can get by with less discounting this holiday season. Retail stocks usually go up the last two months of the year. 

Look at AMC, which had pre-covid highs of $38 and is now at $41 from lows around $2 and change. If $M acts like AMC, it could double from here.",2021-11-06 12:15:34

1097,"Expected Moves this Week, TSLA, DIS, AMC, COIN, NIO, PLTR and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.7% (or $7) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY about **$468**, that corresponds to just above **$473** on the upside and around **$463** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16.50, up slightly from the week before and up a bit to end the week from lows it saw under 15 mid week. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

Options are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **2.0%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $463 and $472 to see Max Gain:

### In the News

Elon Musk posted a Twitter poll over the weekend asking whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. He followed with a tweet saying he would abide by the poll. “Yes” won. It’s unclear what would happen next, as Twitter polls are generally not considered legally binding. Tesla options are pricing about a 6% move for the upcoming week and about 12% for the remainder of November:

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Last week Consumer Cyclical was the leading sector. The top 3 industries were Data Storage, Department Stores, and Rental & Leasing Services. Friday we saw some money flow into Airlines. Intraday trading action was ok but fairly choppy for the most part. Intraday trading becomes more difficult as the major indices get further and further away from moving averages without resting.  Just because a stock is gapping up, does not mean it has to go up. We trade these gaps in both directions, short and long. Many times when I see people struggling with trading, they are directional bias traders. It is fine to trade in only 1 direction but just know that your opportunities will be limited, especially on days where the market fades. BILL, NET and FROG had great opportunities to short Friday, but most people were probably looking at long setups and missed the shorts.

SPY and QQQ are neutral pre-market. IWM is higher after breaking the high of the year long base, which I mentioned a few weeks ago was most likely going to happen. Today there are hundreds of gap ups again. Usually when there are hundreds of stocks gapping pre-market, they tend to get faded off. Not sure what happens today as the IWM is still tryin to run. The SPY and QQQ could use a bit of a rest or pullback so the short term moving averages can catch back up. I'll be prepared for anything and my focus will be on earnings related plays. Good luck trading!

1103,"Could ""meme stocks"" like GME and AMC cause a market crash?","I should preface that I don't have a position in either company, nor any other ""meme stock."" However, I genuinely did not think the prices for GME and AMC would remain this high almost 10 months on. I'm confused as to how much of this is due to retail investors buying in, and how much is due to a genuine protracted short squeeze. I just got a very good job at a media company and I'm a little bummed at the thought that a new recession could take it from me. If it goes ""to the moon,"" great, I'm happy for the people who will profit, but I really don't want financial calamity as a result. Any thoughts?

Edit: yes I know that the HF that short these stocks and are forced to cover by selling off other stocks would be the ones that cause the market to crash. Thanks for correcting my language, seemed to have triggered some of you.",2021-11-08 20:08:13

1105,Sec under 25k day trade limits,"So I remember up to the 2008 crash under 25 accounts could day trade. Then big money fucks ups the market and retail is punished. Now the gme and amc squeze push a new day trade limit of only 1 reset per year. So how does any of this make sense. The rules imposed only further allow tue greed ajd manipulation to continue leaving any little guy with under 25k to have account data sold. Their buys databased and manipulated to the 2 fay settlement or risk of day trade marks andn3 strikes your out for a year. So basically sec rules say if you dont have money dont buy stock and yoy cant day trade to make money. We allow market makers and brokers to usenyour data to manipulate a stock based on large amounts of under 25k accounts to put lressure on sells since they cant trade tye same day forcing only only a larrge loss or or hold. Then they virw holders gmc and amc as the problem????. If they cant sell the same or even 2 days after and rebuc within 1 day, what the fuck do they expect. You rig a system tonthe rich and bitch and moan when retails holds. get he fuck out.

Romove the 25k day trade crap. Is corrupt and illegal.",2021-11-09 14:35:00

1109,Looking for whale hunters.,"I'm a standard programmer. I'm not a stock trader, but I am looking to automate something and I could use a nudge to the right location.   


I want to find a location online, publicly accessible (ok if behind paywall) to view the ""order book"" for stocks so I can track whale movements (think the purchase of AMC by Alliancebernstein reported 11-10).   


I have come across a few sites which appear to be somewhat close such as Ortex and whalewisdom.com, but I'm sure I'm not the first person to try to find this info.   


Again, I'm not a stock guy, just looking at something I may be able to build if I can find the needed pieces of the puzzle.",2021-11-11 16:10:27
1110,Covered calls and covered puts strike right on the money?,"What if I sold AMC 40c strike today and it’s right at 40? Will my shares be called away? I didn’t so I would know the outcome but I wonder what would happen? Likewise if I sold a cash secured put at 40 for today strike, what would happen? Thanks in advance for your replies",2021-11-12 16:29:49
1111,Can/should I sue my brokerage for missed profits of 15k during the GME/NOK/AMC/BB fiasco of January?,"I bought about $500 in AMC weekly calls through TD Ameritrade on January 26th, as well as about $4,000 in NOK stock, and about $300 in NOK calls. As everyone knows, most of the major brokerages went out simultaneously, and then stopped allowing buy orders which crashed the market.

I was on my computer at the time excited that my $4,000 of stocks and calls were now worth $15,000 and briefly over $20,000 when AMC and NOK skyrocketed. I tried to place a sell order, but TD Ameritrade's website wouldn't process it because it was presumably overwhelmed with traffic.

I tried calling but the phone lines were busy, and by the time I got my order through, my $15,000-$20,000 position was back down to $6,000, about the amount I started with.

All of the class action lawsuits seemed to focus on RobinHood specifically, and I'm unsure if I have any ability to sue since I can't prove I tried to place the sell order, since the website wasn't working.

Wondering if it's worth pursuing or if I'm out of luck?

Edit: I realize there's no reason to try now. Only wanted to ask because I'm constantly bombarded with ads to join class action lawsuits from that situation.",2021-11-12 16:52:54

1114,Understanding and Attacking Trader Anxiety: (A Long Read For Serious Traders who Have Issues with Trader Anxiety),"&#x200B;

[Mitigating Anxiety is Mitigating the Unknown, and Mitigating the Unknown is Mitigating Downside Risk](https://preview.redd.it/p7iethoi3fz71.jpg?width=3907&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e32a56b8889a330ea9e33d4d2da4dd728315bbda)

Note: Its a long post. Please don't forget to upvote if you like the content. I worked hard on it and I want folks who experience trader anxiety to benefit from my work. Over 5000 words, 15 minute read.

**Overview:** For those of you who consider yourself seasoned traders, ignore this... although I promise you that you will learn something. For those of you who have anxiety issues I think this will prove to be an invaluable resource. I'm going to put a lot of time into writing this and it is directed at those who have high amounts of anxiety while trading in the markets.

# Reddit is an Enabler of Trading Anxiety:

Back in the day I used to post a metric ton of highly detailed DD on Reddit. I posted my research on Reddit for a simple reason ... I wanted feedback ... I wanted to crowdsource my DD. One of the primary issues I continued to run into was few, if any, added any substantive value in the comment section. I would post DD and 2-4 weeks later I would get a flood of comments of folks who never commented on the thread before, but nevertheless tanked me for all the money they made as a result of reading and taking action on a ticker I wrote about. It was then I noticed that people on Reddit are frequently looking for justification to throw money at anything that may bring them a return. As it turned out the information I posted provided that justification. But this was not the reason I posted the research. Once again, I wanted to crowd source DD.

I stopped posting DD on Reddit altogether. It was a lot of work for too little feedback. I can do a complete deep dive & workup on a company in my head with a pad and pencil within an hour. Putting it all together and posting the information takes considerably more time. I realized that there is a large segment of people who wanted to be told what to invest in with a detailed summary as to why. They generally want to know  the risks, they want to know the possible rewards, and they wanted to know when to buy in, average down, and sell. I therefore opted instead to publish a daily newsletter instead of positing on Reddit.

People on Reddit are buying what they don't understand with information posted by people they ought not to trust. A great deal of DD on Reddit only comes about when some poor fella is bag holding deep and suddenly realizes that he/she wants to share the amazing value with the world under a misguided understanding that they may be able to generate undue interest in the stock. DD on Reddit is bag holders paradise. DD posts on Reddit nearly always means the author is losing money. Remember more recently when SNAP, WISH, or PTON dumped on very poor earnings? Did you happen to notice all the DD that was posted on those tickers days to weeks after? Those were bag holders folks. In part, their anxiety from their losses led them to the desperation of taking to Reddit to pitch trash.

Reddit is a trash heap of poorly written ""DD"" and bad advice. For every solid bit of analysis found on reddit there are thousands of poorly written items that are neither ""due"" nor ""diligent."" How much ""DD"" have you seen posted, for example, with absolutely no consideration for the risk factors? If they're missing a risk section can we honestly say they're being ""diligent"" ... or are they just trying to pump a stock? And there are plenty of new retail traders who have absolutely no clue what they're doing for these fellas to prey on.

There is a reasons so many new retail traders are taking to Reddit for answers. Reddit has received a lot of attention in the media as a result of the GME/AMC fiasco. So new retail traders see Reddit as a place to look for guidance, but instead of guidance, they end up looking for profit in a sea of bad advice. Many are new to the market, they do not know how to read the financials, they do not know how to assess economic conditions, and they do not know how to read/assess (or even find) 10-K's, 10-Q's, 8-K's, earnings calls, etc... They do not know how to value a company, how to identify entry and exit points, how to assess debt, how to conduct competitive analysis, and some even think technical analysis is all you need. They do not know how to assess trailing PE, forward PE, PB, BVPS, PEG, current ratios, PS, Enterprise Value, GAAP EPS, NON GAAP EPS, operating margin, and the list goes on & on & on. And even if they could somewhat do all of this, they don't have the time. So what's the result? ... Massive amounts of confusion, massive amounts of ignorance, and massive amounts of fear of the unknown.

# Fear of the Unknown is the Number One Reason for Trader Anxiety:

The reason that most of you  suffer from trading anxiety is a lack of confidence in your picks which leads to a great deal of fear of the unknown. And there is only one way to eliminate the fear of the unknown. ELEMINATE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THE UNKNOWN. And if you're are trying to eliminate the unknown through scrolling through insufficient DD posts on Reddit, then your anxiety will likely be amplified when you suddenly find out that most of your trades will fail.

# Eliminating the Unknown will Eliminate Anxiety:

Before I retired, I spent 8 years in the Marines as an Infantryman and 13 years in the Army as an intelligence analyst. I've been on the receiving end of information and the production end of information. I've seen the horrible results of bad information, and the absolutely amazing successes in good information. In my experience analysis should overwhelmingly be risk based. Assessing and mitigating risk in my former line of work meant an increased likelihood of mission success, friendly lives saved, and civilian lives saved. The less information you collect and process, the more you simply do not know. Having too many unknowns greatly increases risk and diminishes the chance of mission success. I approach trading in the same fashion. And I know from experience the largest risks come from the unknowns. Learning to identify and spot those unknowns comes largely from experience but you need to begin somewhere. There are 3 types of unknowns.

* **Known Unknows:** These are the items you know you do not know. The overwhelming amount of your effort when assessing an equity is dedicated to filling in the gaps of those items you know you do not know, but would like to know. And much of it is easy to find, but what if you can't? There are many cases in which you would like to know something but the information is not available. In those cases you look for indicators of the information requirements you need to make your case. Remember, you are both looking for indicators that justify your trade and indicators that do not justify your trade. For example, if you are invested in Ruger, Smith & Wesson, an ammunition manufacturer, or an outdoors sporting goods store, the [F](https://stocktipstips.substack.com/p/a-message-for-stocktips-subscribers)[BI's NICS Firearm Background Checks](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view) tracker is a damn find indicator. There are hundreds of government indicators and thousands of open source indicators available. You just need to know where to look.
* **Unknown Knowns:** These are things you know, but either forgot you knew, or failed to apply what you knew to your analysis. Perhaps you have solid information to go on, you just didn't thing to use that particular source. To remedy this you simply need to critically think about what you know and how it applies to your analysis. For example, we all know there are websites that check online traffic patterns. Did you ever think to apply this as an indicator for the online retailor you're invested in? I'm willing to bet no!
* **Unknown Unknowns:** This is perhaps the most dangerous, as it is ALMOST completely derived from ignorance. The more ignorant we are on a certain subject matter the more we run into unknown unknowns. Once you've started on your known knowns, identified your known unknowns (and their indicators), assessed your unknown knowns, you draw your attention to the unknown unknowns. Essentially this is asking ""what the hell am I missing and where can I go to find it,"" or ""where can I look to find the things I do not know I'm missing?""

# Eliminating the Unknown and Mitigating Anxiety:

Investing first and researching later is no way to go about business and it can greatly increase your anxiety! The more you know about your company and the current and future economic conditions, the less anxiety you will have. (Note: Much of the data referenced below can be found under the statics tab of [any given company on Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL). Bottom line is if you know the relative value and prospects of what you own, and the risks thereof, your confidence goes up, and your anxiety drops considerably!

* **Assessing the Known Knowns:** When you begin your analysis you will always start with assessing what you know. You know, that no matter what company you're looking at, you will generally want the following:
   * A forward PE (Price to Earnings) that is lower than the trailing PE, unless you think the market forward PE consensus is wrong.
   * A PE that is relatively lower than sector/industry peers unless you are expecting massive growth.
   * A BV (Book Value) and BVPS (Book Value Per Share) that is closer to the market cap/share price as possible as compared to industry peers.
   * A PS (Price to Sales) ratio of one or less (ideally less than industry/sector peers) of unless, once again, you're expecting massive future growth.
   * A PEG (Price to Earnings Growth) ratio of one or less unless you are pricing in massive growth (Few if any tech companies have a PEG ratio less than one).
   * An enterprise value that is near, or higher than, market cap. Unless, once again, you are expecting massive growth. Companies that have a enterprise value significantly lower than market cap can be possible buyout opportunities.
   * Manageable debt relatively lower than industry peers. (A current ratio above 1 but lower than 5)
   * The company can pay their dividend (see payout ratio)
   * A solid amount of cash on hand.
   * Moderate to high amounts of institutional investment.
   * A solid and growing operating cash flow and operating margin.
   * Increasing YoY Quarterly Revenue Growth and YoY Quarterly EPS Growth.
   * Trading at a value on a pullback of no negative consequence.
   * Solid forward guidance
   * A history of insider confidence through insider buying
   * Solid buy rating analyst coverage and upgrades (Take it with a grain of salt, there are more shitty analysts out there than stars in the sky).
   * Share buybacks are always nice
   * Did you read the most recent [10-K and 10-Q?](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)
   * Did you read the the Risk Factors on the most recent 10-K and 10-Q?
   * Did you read the latest [SEC filings?](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)
   * Did you review the last 4 earnings (Seeking Alpha collects them all to include the earnings transcripts under the news section under any given ticker)
   * How many analysts cover the stock, what rating did they give, and has it been recently been [upgraded or downgraded?](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/aapl/ratings)
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Company:** You can never eliminate all the unknowns about the company. But you can ask yourself the following:
   * Is the company at risk for an offering?
   * Can future revenues cover additional debt and reinvestment?
   * What are the chances the company does not preform as expected?
   * How critical will it be for my investment if the company misses EPS projections? Its an important question to ask. Companies underperform EPS all the time amid earnings. More often than not it means the company is still growing, just not at the rate analysts expected. For most profitable companies, missing EPS projections does NOT mean the company isn't profitable. Companies with a positive EPS should typically be better off this quarter on the books than the previous quarter.
   * Is the company's goals realistic and obtainable?
   * Is the company under or over shooting projected guidance?
   * Are analysts under or over shooting guidance?
   * Is the space the company competes in overcrowded?
   * Is the company losing or gaining market share as compared to competitors?
   * Does the company have a competitive advantage or disadvantage?
   * Is the leadership competent?
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Current and Future Economic Conditions:** This can be tough but at minimum you should study current and [upcoming economic datasets](https://tradingeconomics.com/) and ask how a positive or negative change in the various categories affects your company. You will also want to come up with your own short, medium, and long term projection of economic conditions and how they will affect your company. Always pay attention to the [economic calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsubyk/next_weeks_economic_calendar_1115202111222021/)!
   * Inflation Rate (Low is good for preventing dramatic shifts in personal spending, high is good for paying off long term debt. Remember if inflation ever gets to a point where people economize on needs and cut back on wants, it can mean bad news for the wants!)
   * Semiconductor Shortage
   * Worker Shortage (Can they meet demand with the workers they got? If not can they beat previous quarters EPS with the workers they got?)
   * Supply Chain Bottlenecks (Check their domestic inventories as a solid indicator of how affected they are by this)
   * Rising fuel and Energy Costs
   * Rising Shipping Costs
   * Government & Regulatory Environment
   * Federal Reserve Policy
   * Reliance on China and Chinese Economic/Regulatory Environment
   * Unemployment Rate and Labor Force Participation Rate (Too high less people are buying, too low and the cost of labor goes up)
   * Always Pay Close Attention to the [ECONOMIC CALANDER](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsubyk/next_weeks_economic_calendar_1115202111222021/) and the results reported!

# Perspective and Expectation Management Also Mitigates Anxiety:

It's gonna go to the moooooon!!!! No it isn't! Read my part on Big money below to find out why. It's important that you have reasonable expectations. It's important that you have a decent and realistic perspective on the outcome of your trade. Doing this will go leaps and bounds toward mitigating your anxiety.

* **There is NO Such thing as a Perfect Stock:**  If your anxiety is so through the roof that you're forgoing great trades on good companies, cut that shit out! There is no such thing as a perfect stock and you will always need to accept a certain degree of risk!
* **Do not Sweat Minor Misses in EPS:** You're company barely missed analysts EPS or Revenue Expectations? So what!!?? Are they profitable? Are they growing? If they had positive revenue and EPS, chances are they're still growing on the books. Sure their rate of growth may have changed but they're adding money to the balance sheet! It would be one thing if they lowered guidance, but short of that a small EPS miss isn't nothing to frown upon and might put you in the position to buy some more stock for a cheaper price on a really good company! If holding a little longer gives you anxiety then its because you're attempting to get money quick by swinging trades, which is fine, but can add an additional layer of anxiety. I love it when companies miss small but stand by their guidance. The street has a fit as the share price sells off, affording me the chance to enter in.
* **Expect the Unexpected and Have a Plan:** Black Swans happen. Major unexpected economic shifts happen. Your dry bulk carrier will catch fire or lose their cargo in the ocean. Oil companies will have spills. Companies get sued all the time. Adjusted economic numbers come out every day of the week. Your stock WILL NOT trade as everyone expects it to. Get used to this and you will mitigate your anxiety. Buy in slowly and have a plan, and you will mitigate it even more.
* **Analysts are Always Wrong:** Firstly it is important to understand that analyst price targets are where the analyst expects the stock to be in a year or so. Not right now. I see a lot of retail traders complaining about the company share price not being at the analyst price target. Its ridiculous expectation management! And unnecessary anxiety.
* **Understand how Big Money Operates and Expect their Antics!:**  When large institutions dealing in millions to billions of dollars decide to buy or sell a stock, they are well aware that they will inevitably move the share price. The volume they create can be massive. To mitigate this they will either sell calls or buy puts when they sell a considerable lot of shares, or buy calls or sell puts when they buy a considerable lot of shares. Therefore it is important to understand that institutions can often make money no matter which way the stock trades. Unlike most retail traders they even have the option to go both long & short on the same security at the same time. They can, & do, often go short to take advantage of the bearish sentiment they inevitably create while selling large blocks of shares while locking in their profit using a combination of options strategies. Always remember that retail does not own the market … big money does. This reality forces us to come to grips with the necessity not to fight them, but to ride their backs. This includes having the discipline & courage of our convictions to hold through the bearish sentiment institutions inevitably create, on perfectly good companies, when some big firm takes profit. Consider retail traders like ourselves the small Remora Fish attached to a large Great White Shark (The Institutions), waiting to ride their backs out of but a temporary rut of no true consequence.
* **Trading Psychology:** Psychology plays a large part of why stocks can continue to trade below street value (The value most traders believe fair). Once a stock sells off due to large institutional profit taking, the street wonders why. Does someone know something we don’t? Was there some economic data that cast bearish sentiment on this particular industry or sector? Does the street expect the company to act in a way that will lower its valuation? Such questions, & many more, aren’t just asked by us. They’re asked by everyone who holds a position in the company we do. And these questions cause anxiety. Even analysts may downgrade a stock for no other reason than to tailor their expectations a year out from now. Indeed they hate to be wrong, & they always are. So do not be surprised not only when a security we thought was already undervalued sells off further than expected, but also stays down as it may take time for traders to feel comfortable entering again. Corrections back to street value can often take a few weeks to a few months. Sometimes until next earnings to relive fears of both retail & large institutions.

# Processes Mitigate Anxiety:

Processes mitigate anxiety. The more efficient the process the less time you spend searching for places to put that money that's burning a hole in your pocket. Some traders feel as though they are in a rush to hurry up and strike while the iron is hot and put their money somewhere only to find out that  they rushed their trades and realized a loss. Below is my process and a few additional pointers for researching equities and it mitigates A LOT of my personal trader anxiety.

1. **Assess the Economic Conditions First!:** Assessing the economic conditions first grants you the opportunity to single out those sectors that stand to benefit the most from current and future economic conditions. If you do not know how to do this please see an earlier post I made on this very topic [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qrtkox/understanding_and_profiting_from_our_current/). Also investing in companies that stand to benefit the most from economic conditions gives you an extra layer of confidence to fight anxiety.
2. **Make a Price Based Assessment Watchlist and Set your Alerts:** A Price Based Assessment Watchlist is simply adding companies that you've 1. Assessed the Current or Future Economic Conditions as Favorable. 2. Did a Quick Review of the [Company Financials](https://stocktipstips.substack.com/p/stocktips-investment-research-series). 3. Set your alert at your desired reassessment price. ONLY when that alert hits is when you do the rest of your research and DD. That way you ONLY use your valuable time on the most promising of circumstances. That way you aren't frantically searching and scrolling for plays, but letting the plays come to you, which helps with anxiety!
3. **Buy on a Pullback of Little to No Negative Consequence:** I love a good dump. Perhaps it comes from a bad market day, perhaps it comes from the sector in general doing poorly that day, and perhaps it comes from a whale taking profit. I don't care. If the financials are great, I expect the company to grow, and the economic conditions are favorable, such a pullback will trigger my buy alerts letting me know its time for a starter position. But first I do a quick assessment to see if there is any recent negative news that is driving down the share price. If there is negative news, I ask myself to what degree is the news of legitimate financial substance to the growth prospects of the company. If very little, I'll be happy to buy that dip. Some would argue that they want to jump in on solid relative strength. Yeah ... they're chasing and I don't chase. I like it when its cold, not when its hot. Later, when my thesis becomes true, then it gets hot and I watch everyone else chase. But buying on a pullback of little to no consequence will give you that extra layer of value and security you may have been looking for. You wont be worried if the security is over pumped and about to fall, but rather patiently waiting for it to pump again. I think the latter of the two holds less anxiety. More profitable too!
4. **Keep Track of the News:** If you want to monitor your investments stop looking at the chart and read all the news that comes out on your company. Two good places to do this are seeking alpha (Put the ticker in and click the news tab) and, believe it or not, StockTwits! The bots and the news scroller on StockTwits are money! Ignore the people there, read the news scroller!
5. **Set Price Alerts on Current Positions:** Set price alerts at 5% above or below your starter position price. Its a lot more easy to go about your day that way, and waaay less anxiety when you can be rest assured that at minimum your investment has not pumped or lost 5%. If your stock does dump 5% and you get alerted, perhaps then you might want to check for bad news and average down as necessary. Otherwise leave it be!

# Anxiety Mitigating Rules to Live by:

Some added anxiety killing tips!

* **If you aren't willing to hold the stock long term, stay away from it!:** So you think you're going to swing it real quick and get out so you don't need to put too much effort into the trade? Think again. The technical analysis guru on YouTube may have a pretty technical set up, but he's going to throw your anxiety through the roof. And only IF you're lucky, you MAY make a profit.
* **Quit Checking your Phone, Set Alerts Instead:** Set share price points where you want to be alerted and quit checking your phone. I promise you that your anxiety is really going to increase when you're fired from work because you spend too much time checking your investments and too little time getting anything done.
* **Stay Away from Risky Options Strategies:** So you wanted to get rich quick so you bough a bunch of naked calls or puts? All or nothing baby!! Well there goes your anxiety. The more professional you are with options the less anxiety you'll have.
* **Be a Net Options Seller:** Covered calls while you're waiting for your position to turn over long periods of time is a great idea. Its like getting a free dividend and it lowers your cost basis. I've been selling POWW calls for the last three months and in addition to profiting from the increase in share price, I've cashed in $0.56 in premium per share, a 9% gain on the overall position on options premium alone. At this point I don't care how the stock trades. Talk about low anxiety huh? I'll sell calls till the cows come home and if the shareprice on the last day before expiry is slightly over the strike on the calls I sold, pending I want to hold on to the shares I'll just roll the options to another month for additional premium. Furthermore when I can't get a stock for the price I want I often just sell an in the money cash secured put if the options premium is worth it. Lets say a stock is trading for $6.00 but the $7.50 strike put is trading for $2.70. That means the real price to me if assigned is $4.80 per share. Talk about a steal! I'll sell that contract all day every day! And with practically no anxiety on a solid company!
* **Don't buy in all at once, do NOT chase!:** Don't just throw in a full allocation all at once on a stock. Rather establish a starter position and buy in slowly in the red. This will greatly lower your cost average and increase your profitability. For example, if you established a starter position but now you find yourself down 5%, you can just buy an equally sized position and now you only need the stock to increase 2.5% to recover from your loss. Does this help with your anxiety? You bet it does! Finally, if the stock skyrockets don't chase it. Enjoy the profit and move on. Chasing has been the windowmaker of plenty of traders ... particularly in the penny stock world.
* **Keep 25-50% Cash to the Side:** Sure it limits your profit, but it can also enhance your profit too. Especially amid uncertain times. The market will never react the way you think it will and it is important to keep some cash to the side in the event the market turns sour. And imagine the amount of anxiety you save by knowing in the long run you can not only double down on a good company, but you can profit more as well. Lets say the stock you're in dipped 25% on a market panic. Well if you bought a reliably profitable company you will eventually recover. But if you used that cash to the side to double down you'll only need to wait until the stock rebounds 12.5%. By the time the stock recovers 25% you'll have made 12.5% profit.
* **Margin is for Emergencies:** Margin for small retail traders should strictly be used for emergencies. One such emergency for me was the big COVID dump. Sure I made some decent money shorting DIS but that alone did not make up my losses. I also had some cash to the side. And I bought the dip. Much to my surprise however the market kept dipping. I took out 25% leverage on my marginable positions. Because I had cash to the side and I saved margin only for emergencies, I was able to profit big from the rebound.
* **Stay away from unprofitable companies and Penny Stocks:** This speaks for itself. I have analyzed a the risk on a bunch of penstocks. And unprofitable companies can often disappoint. Indeed the volatility is there, and there is profit to be made amid volatility. However trust me when I tell you that if you are reading this, it means you likely need help in your trading habits, and you should just stay away from penny stocks and unprofitable companies.
* **If You go Short, Consider Buying a Call:** If you're short, you can lose a lot of money if the trade turns against you. But by buying an at the money call when yo go short on 100 shares, you have the same effect of buying a put when you're long. The max you can lose if you're short and you bought an at the money call, is the price of the call and perhaps just a little bit more in some circumstances. The price of a stock can literally go from $10 to $1000, but still, if you bought a call, your losses are capped at the strike of the call plus premium. You wont even need to cover. When the call is assigned it will automatically cover the play for you. And if the price dips low enough to the point you received enough profit to cover the cost of the call and a little more, you can cover the stock and if you so choose to hold on to the call option, it's paid for! Its a free call. You can sell it if you wish, or hold it as a lotto. But either way you're anxiety is reduced because you can only lose so much on your short position! This is why I laugh when people say ""shorts are scared."" Big money ALWAYS hedges their short position. They cant stand the anxiety of a naked short and neither should you!
* **So You're Down 5%? Who Cares?:** 5% is nothing but a great place to average down. You did your DD, you've assessed the economic conditions, plenty of institutions are satisfied with the stock, what have you got to worry about? Expect this and let it in to your way of life. It's going to happen. Just average down with the money you have to the side and hold. They will continue to make money quarter after quarter which will increase their book value which will eventually get realized by upward price momentum.
* **BUY RELIABLY RPOFITABLE COMPANIES PRIMED FOR GROWTH, TRADING AT A SECTOR RELATIVE VALUE, ON A PULLBACK OF NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE, WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT, UNDER FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS!:** Swing for grand slams and you'll strike out, or ground out nearly every time. Swing for base hits and you'll hit base hits, home runs, and grand slams on a very regular basis!

# You will NEVER Get Rid of All of your Anxiety:

Its got to be said! You will never get rid of all of your anxiety. You just put a significant amount of cash you worked hard for into shares of a company subject to both positive and negative market forces. There will always be unknowns. Therefore, there will always be anxiety.

**TL;DR:** First, I HIGHLY suggest you read this if you feel that you are the target audience. The thesis above speaks to the fact that anxiety in trading largely comes from the unknown, & the more you mitigate the unknown the less anxiety you will experience. Above there are plenty of steps you can do to mitigate the unknown, thereby developing your confidence, and become a more profitable trader. I also argue that you can mitigate a large portion of your anxiety simply by understanding what you're buying in an equity, understand the markets, understanding trading techniques, developing a sense of perspective, and buying ""*reliably profitable companies, primed for growth, trading a sector relative value, on pullback of little to no negative consequence, with a decent amount of institutional investment, under favorable economic conditions.*"" This post is for people serious about mitigating their anxiety and learning how to trade in a manner that will benefit both their mental health and their wallets. In summary, if traders respect their own money and do what they're supposed to do, it will go a long way to mitigating anxiety.",2021-11-13 16:31:55
1115,$CANO's Clash: Hedge Funds shorting vs CEO buying ATM shares on margin,"For those of you that don't know what the company does, here are a few DD's explaining: \[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1j8q6/cano_an_undervalued_stock_and_a_way_to_profit_off/)\] \[[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pfzoda/cano_big_way_to_play_boomers_aging_execs_recently/)\] \[[3](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1399560672237830145)\] \[[In-detail video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYhx6tdolMM)\] - $CANO is an ex-SPAC who's PIPE has already dumped for those worried.

Timeline:

**August 12**: CANO crushes and beats Q2 earnings & rev, raises FY21 & FY22 guidance - stock dumps by \~15%

**August 13**: Short interest sits at 7.5%

**August 18th**: CEO of $CANO, Marlow ""Max Bid"" Hernandez calls bullshit on the stock price and begins to aggressively buy up **at-the-market** shares and warrants for the following 2 week period, ended up totaling to: $26.9M worth of shares/$1.5m worth of warrants (Figure displayed below later in the post)

**September 21st**: Citi initiates $CANO with a 'Buy', price target of $20 - I highlight this because Citi underwrote the CEO's margin loan. Citi also scaled in by buying 17M CANO shares in Q3.

**September 27th**: Marlow files a [13D](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001800682/000119312521284160/d232831dsc13d.htm) disclosing his holdings, we learn that Marlow margined his 22M share position to fund the August purchases of 1.65M shares and 428k warrants

**October 15:** Short interest doubles to 14.1%

**October 19:** Piper Sandler initiates coverage on $CANO with a 'neutral' rating, price target of $11 - Piper Sandler is however bullish on $CANO's 1:1 competitor $OSH, with a price target of $69

[$CANO analyst coverage. Piper Sandler = only non-bullish analyst on $CANO. ](https://preview.redd.it/5a03oxq0bqz71.png?width=1732&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=551a43eb1e02790605c504ce38d2de1e97d43148)

[$OSH coverage. Every single analyst is bullish on $OSH and its sector. Note: Some of these initiations are a few quarters old and have been upgraded since. Piper Sandler has since upgraded their PT to $69](https://preview.redd.it/9zmu720abqz71.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7453647e437608537dcd6ce3eb2a8ad3819bf21a)

Note: CANO also happens to be asleep at the wheel due to lack of analyst coverage as can be seen above (1/4th the coverage its peers has). This is a prime example of what Peter Lynch meant when he stated that he firmly believed that individual investors had an inherent advantage over large institutions: large institutions either wouldn't or couldn't invest in smaller-cap companies that have yet to receive big attention from analysts or mutual funds. On that note, let's compare CANO to its peers:

CANO valuation comparison vs OSH and AGL:

[$CANO trades at a 40&#37; discount to their peers at a 2.4x rev multiple. Note: CANO has since raised their FY22 guidance to $2.65B rev, up from the $2.55B that the chart above displays \(raised last week upon reporting Q3 earnings\) - Highlighted in green is what CANO should be trading at if it is to trade at rev multiples in line with their peers.](https://preview.redd.it/ogryqubtcqz71.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d1fb82729bbcd65501aac5842382f03b8600cc32)

[CANO holds several advantages over OSH. Most notable perhaps is CANO being EBITDA positive as opposed to OSH. ](https://preview.redd.it/ntxcb260eqz71.png?width=1764&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aef29b2e144681a5f96cf40ed8ad5806a8fa8f39)

Side by side MLR comparison:

Let's compare insider trading:

[$CANO. Insiders have not sold a single share since going public. As previously mentioned, CEO Marlow & CCO began scooping up ATM shares beginning August 18, with the price paid per share ranging from $9.82 to $11.99.  The stock still trades at $11.72 as of the date of this post.](https://preview.redd.it/85joz8y2fqz71.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=62ce5e6d60f23dcae51b2b31b01636f8df842fbe)

[$OSH. Relentless selling from the CEO, COO, CFO, CLO, CMO. The page goes further and doubles in size, I couldn't fit them all in 1 screenshot.](https://preview.redd.it/p48txbeqfqz71.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f878a430fd835b82c4d69f6d35e313b2b7d4f193)

So, why is Piper Sandler, being the odd one out, bullish on OSH but not CANO?

Judd Arnold, CIO of Lake Cornelia Research Management, who holds over 10M+ shares of CANO believes this was driven and funded by pod shop shorts ([source](https://twitter.com/CorneliaLake/status/1450797528371367941)). Note that Judd has previously worked at several pod shops, notably Citadel, etc.

Piper Sandler flat out lies about CANO missing on their guidance call of 15-20 de novos for FY21 by claiming that CANO has opened no more than 6 de novos. Piper note (CANO coverage initiation):

https://preview.redd.it/qrmyswe2kqz71.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4de6762bf68b889c3c0233377072be7dab3774ba

This is what CANO's CFO had to say about Piper's 6 de novo claim in a call with Lake Cornelia ([source](https://twitter.com/CorneliaLake/status/1450471193967013889)):

https://preview.redd.it/59qhsh6ckqz71.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e860696b217aa4badac1806dee1ff937fcddc9cf

As for why the short interest is so high, former finance bro Anpanman (@spacanpanman on Twitter or u/apan-man), who holds $1.6m+ worth of CANO shares and warrants, believes these pod shops have to run factor neutral: they are long a VBC name ($OSH), so they need to short the others. CANO appears to have been a popular shorting target due to it being a SPAC.

Back to the timeline:

**November 9**: CANO reports a wonderful quarter (Q3), misses earnings but beats rev with an increase of 100% YOY, with adjusted EBITDA at $35.2 million increasing 53% YOY. Membership stands at 210,663 including 120,086 Medicare capitated members, a YOY increase of 105% and 65% respectively. Buoyed by the performance, guidance is yet again raised for FY2021 and FY2022.

$CANO sees a +12% day post-earnings

OSH misses earnings but beats rev. They too have a strong quarter and raise FY21 and 22 guidance, but they disclose that they received a DOJ CID. All the relentless OSH insider selling suddenly begins to make sense (granted, they could have sold for a number of different reasons, I'm making assumptions here) - CANO on the other hand has stated on their Q3 call that they have *not* received a DOJ CID and that they never use third party marketers to bring in members. They specifically said that is a bright line they will never cross.

$OSH sees a -21% day post-earnings.

Piper Sandler defends OSH post-Q3 earnings, but lowers their Price Target from $69 to $55 (still sees +69% upside). Piper believes that OSH should be trading at 5.5x rev multiple. If a 5.5x rev multiple were to be applied to CANO, it'd put CANO at \~$26 a share. [Here](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1458399877449359360) is a twitter thread that further breaks down Piper Sandlers fuckery.

**November 12:** Short interest sits at 19.48%. This is an abnormally high amount for a flourishing company like CANO. It's currently the 30th most shorted NYSE-listed company. Right up there with companies like AMC, SPCE, and HYLN lol.

[Most shorted NYSE listed stocks. CANO sits at #30.](https://preview.redd.it/b32lzw68pqz71.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=37fde11a77f7da273d583c2162bca21eec8c3c16)

Remember folks:

""Insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise."" - Peter Lynch

But when they're buying them on *margin*? You best believe they think they're going to the moon 🚀

Note that Marlow's position becomes a billion-dollar position at $40 a share, which will inevitably happen within the next year two, provided they keep executing as good as they have been - and you know they will if the CEO puts his money where his mouth is with margined ATM shares. He's in it to win it.

**TL;DR**: CANO is a criminally undervalued stock that trades at a 40% discount to its peers. Despite CANO successfully executing and raising guidance for several consecutive quarters, it is victim to a high short interest. CANO is also asleep at the wheel due to lack of analyst coverage. CEO Marlow Hernandez realizes all of this and has put his money where his mouth is by buying at-the-market shares on margin, while shorts have stubbornly doubled down on their position for seemingly no good reason.

**Edit 1, November 16**: SI has now dropped to 14.16% from 19.48% during the period of November 1 - November 15. It's no longer the #30th most shorted NYSE-listed stock, and is now the #81st. Perhaps a few shorts have covered after CANO's solid Q3 earnings report! (CANO Q3 earnings reported on Nov 9)

**Edit 2, November 25**: CEO Marlow Hernandez buys more ATM shares and warrants (worth   
$151,300) for the first time since August 31 (8k shares @ $9.65, 30k warrants @ $2.47).

**Edit 3, December 8:** So sorry to anybody that played this :(. Growth stocks took a dump and CANO took a huge dive, breaking new ATLs. Marlow has bought $400k+ worth of stocks and warrants for the period of Nov 25-Dec 8 so far; I take it that Q4 is going well. There may be more purchases coming but this will be my final update. I've incurred huge losses myself, off reddit for a while. Thanks to everybody that read this post, and sorry once again :(",2021-11-15 07:57:10

1122,Industry incumbents influence on the Social Media Community and Stock Price Movement for the leaders in the industry," I recently started investing in the market and started observing certain trends that are prevalent in the market. What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the brand names in the industry and the investor community for that industry in the market. For example, Apple, it has a strong following in the social media channels and usually positive sentiments on the social media channels about the stock results in a price increase. Today's chart - 

[Sentiment increase --\> Price Increase ](https://preview.redd.it/99wn6n3ipg081.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=68271307ef505f4377b59bd7f056479904c287e9)

What you would notice in this chart is that at around 9 AM today the bullish sentiments for APPL started growing on the social channel and this was followed by a price increase a couple of hours later. I also noticed the news about them accelerating their autonomous car, so that contributed to the social chatter on these channels as well. I saw this trend usually in industries where there are established brand names, such as Automotive (TSLA, RIVN), Entertainment (AMC, GME) and TMT (Microsoft, FB etc.) 

But at the same time, industries such as Marijuana, Psychedelics etc. do not really follow this trend. As I try to understand why? one reason that I could think of is that these industries do not have a strong established incumbent and hence do not really have a strong social following. Which further leads me to think that these industries are just scratching the surface of their potential market cap. Another reason that comes to mind is the percentage of the shares that are held by institutions vs individuals. So, for companies and industries where we do not see a price movement following an uptick on social media, would it be safe to assume that most investors are institutions and not individuals. 

How do you all perceive the social media sentiments and their relation to the stock market for growing industry vs an establish industry? Sorry if the conclusions that I have drawn are very basic and not thorough, but I would appreciate a perspective or some direction to learn more.",2021-11-18 21:20:36

1125,Merrill Edge Level 4 (write option credit spread) requirements,"Hi, **Due to the nature of my day job, I cannot use certain brokers.** Therefore, I use Merrill Edge for my self directed margin account trading (options). **My current account is restricted from ""risky"" options strategies.** I currently have the ability to

\-buy calls

\-buy puts

\-buy strangles (treated like one security)

\-buy calls/puts with an intent to roll them automatically

\-sell covered calls after the underlying settles

\-sell cash secured puts

The criteria to get this far was ""apply for margin with 2k in your account"", or something similar.

**I recently got off a phone call with their customer support asking for the ability to sell credit spreads.** (I think it should be treated like a cash secured put that has minimal assignment risk). **The phone representative could not say the criteria** and said ""more money in your account could increase your likelihood after you apply"".

**Optional Backstory:**

I have blown up my account 3 times (600$ starting, 2k starting, 3k starting), and I now have about 600$ in my real ML account. Losses include

\- believing that i ""Just need to be bolder with my 0DTE SPY options to get the WSB returns""

\- selling covered calls on AMC at 9$ per share when i got in at 13

\- buying leaps and shares on a ""long term sure bet"" that is currently down \~ 70% and I am waiting for my leaps to expire in \~13 more months.

I looked into trying to get 0.5% return per day from the option wheel (theta gang) but due to the nature of my job, a number of blue chip stocks are restricted, and the ones that are small are traded in increments of $0.05 so I must be all in one stock and cannot diversify or have any kind of risk management, so I have stayed away from this until my account is closer to 30k or more.

I have been using Tradingvue to papertrade a small swing trade account (2k), and I have been learning the ways to have a goal of 1% growth per day or \~5% per week and I have grown that account by about 50% across a month due to a couple homeruns and strict risk management.

I have recently backtested a options strategy that should have a return of \~10% daily of the amount at risk. I looked at the kelly bet size calculator adjusted for simple returns and see that based on these inputs I should put \~80% of my account at risk. I intend to keep it at less than 30% (so daily expected returns are \~3%) until I have a lot more risk management data and experience with this strategy.

**My question for reddit:**

Do we have anyone in this subreddit who has Merrill Edge Margin accounts who can say characteristics of their account when they applied and were given the right to open credit spreads?

**What are the requirements to be given the right to open credit spreads with my broker?**

**What I think my broker wants:**

Merrill Edge Bank of America does not want to have me blow up an account like selling Naked calls on GME then not paying them. I think they want me to have a lot of assets that they could seize if I screwed them over with poor margin account management.

Sadly I will be subject to assignment risk in a credit spread, so I think that I need to watch it carefully.

**In a credit spread, is there any risk that due to an assignment, my amount-at-risk could increase?** Example: I sell a call at 100 strike for .9, and I buy a call at 101 strike for .8, so my amount at risk is 100 - (90-80) = 90. In the case of assignment, My .9 call becomes shares that I must cover from my .8 call or the market (whatever is cheaper). Therefore **is there no ""assignment risk"" associated with a credit spread?**",2021-11-20 19:29:26
1126,"With the current market condition, do i sell my beloved AMC to fund other stocks?! Or do I just diamond hand this like the ape that I am and just buy stocks later?",,2021-11-21 00:47:49
1127,Is this a Bubble?,"Red flags: 

Valuations for EV companies like Rivian, Tesla and others seem far above their true value. Example: how can a company that delivers 0 vehicles have the same marketcap as Ford? How is that not just hype?

Are stock prices inflated by low interest rates? 

Are these public offerings all way overvalued? Stocks like Robinhood and Coinbase seem to be valued far above what they’re worth upon initial IPO.

All the capital seems to be flowing to tech stocks, EVs and AI that haven’t really delivered anything yet. 

Also, is Pelosi driving Roblox up by virtue of having bought so many shares?

This “recovery” of the stock market doesn’t seem in sync with an economy that clearly hasn’t recovered.

Companies like Zillow** no longer buying homes. Dead stop on ibuying. Losing money. 

Meme stocks like GME, AMC, DWAC, I mean come on. I understand what Apes are doing and I think it’s awesome and cool, but how long can this really go on for? I mean really?

Help me understand.",2021-11-21 01:05:12
1128,Implied volatility & open interest?,"Looking to start off small $50-100 into options

What is a good open interest and implied volatility area to work with? I been playing spy, riot, lucid and amc last week. Mostly losing all money i put in almost.

I do have a put for MU on monday. People said it was a dumb move but the daily has a gap to the downside that needs filled and its a toss up with how the market will be on open. So we'll see i guess.

Been trying to dig around and find youtubers that do small account challenges and show the reason why they are picking certain stocks for options but theyre hard to find.",2021-11-21 02:30:00

1135,"Giant U.S. Pension Bought AMC, Snowflake, and Tilray Stock","The second-largest public pension by assets in the U.S. increased its stake in one of the year’s most-volatile stocks, initiated a position in a marijuana grower, and trimmed its exposure to Warren Buffett.

The California State Teachers’ Retirement System bought more shares of movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (ticker: AMC) and analytics-software firm Snowflake ( SNOW ), acquired shares of the cannabis producer Tilray (TLRY), and reduced its holdings in Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKb ), Buffett’s investment juggernaut. Calstrs, as the pension is known, disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Calstrs said it doesn’t comment on its holdings or on individual investment managers. The pension managed $321.9 billion in assets as of Oct. 31​.

Calstrs bought 133,512 more shares of AMC to end the third quarter with 689,917 shares. AMC’s stock price rocketed nearly 19-fold in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter shares are down 1%. For comparison, the S&P 500 index rose 15% in the first nine months, and has gained 6.7% so far in the fourth quarter.

AMC stock caught fire during the meme-stock frenzy early in the year, when small investors communicating via social media bought shares of beaten-down companies in hopes of triggering gains that would force people who had bet against those stocks to buy in order to close their bets. The trend led to a surge in volatility that prompted the Federal Reserve to warn this month that meme-stock related market swings could be a risk to the financial system. AMC’s third-quarter results were better than expected, and the chain is now accepting cryptocurrencies for online payments.

The pension bought 347,900 Tilray shares in the third quarter; at the end of the second, it hadn’t owned any. Tilray stock rose 37% in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter shares are down 6.4%. In early October, Tilray reported a wider-than-expected loss for the fiscal first quarter. Recent legislative proposals, including one that would decriminalize pot at the federal level have lifted Tilray and its peers. The legal-pot sector, however, saw layoffs during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Snowflake stock rose 7.5% in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter shares have gained 20%. The gain could have been bigger, but Snowflake and other cloud-software peers slipped after President Joe Biden nominated Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell to another four-year term. Interest rates rose in the wake of the nomination, tempering enthusiasm for richly valued, high-growth stocks. The company reported a mixed second quarter in August, and Snowflake will report its third quarter after the market close on Dec. 1. Calstrs bought 119,934 additional Snowflake shares to end the third quarter with 328,801 shares.

The pension sold 511,630 class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway to end the third quarter with 2.9 million shares of Buffett’s firm. Shares rose 18% in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter they have gained 3.7%. Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had a record $149 billion in cash at the end of September. Buffett and John Malone—two billionaires skilled in tax-efficient transactions—recently did a stock swap. During the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway itself sold Big Pharma stock.

Now I know what you may be thinking. What is this guy on? This account was from early COVID with money I had lying around figured I’d give stocks a go and somewhere along the way I messed with it less and less until I stopped completely. Would it be best to just flat out sell it all and work my way back up? Or go stock by stock and try to predict the outlook for each? Any and all unofficial advice would be appreciated. First thing I’d like to do is condense my stock picks as I’m spread across the world with this many. Not quite sure if the majority of the market is down this past month or if it is just the general stocks I have majority of money in atm. Thanks for reading this far, lmk.",2021-12-02 00:35:43

1141,(12/2) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to a new day, frrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-

*****

# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.
*****
> The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration’s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.
*****
> Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.
*****
> Dow component Boeing’s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.
*****
> “We remain cautious on S&P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,” said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity & quantitative strategy.
*****
> Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.
*****
> “Another risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell’s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word ‘transitory’ indicate that the Fed’s focus is now inflation rather than employment.
*****
> During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.
*****

**Overview:**

Arizona Metals (AMC) is a little known copper-gold mining and exploration company trading at extremely discounted levels. The metal content is predominantly copper but the byproduct of gold, zinc and silver position AMC to be among the lowest cost producers. Based in Arizona, ranked #2 by Fraser Institute for investment attractiveness, AMC owns 100% (royalty free) of the prospective Kay Mine asset, Sugarloaf Peak and two very promising West and Central target properties. AMC’s Flagship asset, the Kay Mine, is a past producer from a high-grade VMS deposit. Located in a top mining jurisdiction, near existing infrastructure, highway and water rights, and within short trucking distance to 4 operating copper smelters owned by Majors that are actively looking for high grade feed (eg Freeport, Grupo Mexico). AMC is on track to be a 10 bagger as they are a well-funded company, trading at a deep discount, a REAL M&A candidate ideal for any major/midtier producer, expected to shoot up on all upcoming monthly drill results as they expand and identify new resources.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kude8f3aa5381.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d92a186e3fd89e38bf6e061b24902458046e5bcb

The stock has the potential for **1000% future upside**. For anyone willing to understand the story and dig into the results, it is clear that this stock should at the **very least be trading at $16+ USD (267% upside)**. This valuation is backstopped by the historic asset that was recently expanded via drill results. At current prices, the true upside comes from the optionality from any potential resource hits at the West/Central targets. In sum, you are buying an historic resource at Kay Mine at a deep discount, plus a FREE option on Sugarloaf, West and Central- if there are any positive resource hits at these locations the stock will go parabolic. The risk/reward profile indicates far more upside.

**Side note of confidence:** Dr. Mark Hannington, the worlds foremost expert on VMS deposits, was brought on as a consultant to AMC (strictly for academic purposed, NO PAY) recently mentioned that the Western target is the real prize. He anticipates the West to dwarf the Kay Deposit. Having reviewed every piece of available information from the company, Dr. Hannington believes that all things equal, assuming no original drill work, that the **West would have appeared to be 5 times more likely to hit than the Kay deposit.** Anticipating high probability of a large discovery at West and Central as well.

Hypothetically, if they hit a resource at the Central and West targets (together with existing Kay Mine) this could be one of the worlds most coveted VMS deposits- a jewel in the portfolio of every Major miner and investor. AMC likely gets acquired by a major well before the stock approaches higher price scenarios.

**Macro:**

Stagnating copper mine supply (due to less projects, already fatigued and depressed cutoff grades), colliding with strong demand (for EV and new electrical infrastructure), will push copper prices far higher than anyone expects.

Robert Friedland says ""You will need a telescope to see the price of copper"". Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs said that ""copper could reach $15,000 by 2025 as the world transitions to clean energy"". Professional resource investors, Goehring & Rozencwajg, claim that copper prices could ""potentially peak near $15 per pound"" this decade. The bull market in copper is only just beginning and there is plenty of room for prices to run higher in the underlying commodity. The progressive and environmental movement continues to gain traction, governments and corporations globally are continuing a push to reduce carbon emissions. This will require a tremendous amount of investment in developing new electrical infrastructure across the globe and also a continued shift among consumers towards more Electric Vehicles (EV)/alternatives. Qualitatively speaking, this will require a massive amount of copper for which we simply do not have enough supply coming online to satisfy.

The most important consideration in the copper market relates to the lack of meaningful copper projects expected to come to market and the magnitude of depletion at current, existing mines- a subject that many investors fail to pay attention to, let alone understand. Please read 2021.Q1 commentary from Goehring & Rozencwajg for their in depth study around copper supply depletion and lack of large scale projects coming online. Copper supply mine growth is expected to grind to a halt this decade. The number of new world-class discoveries coming online will decline substantially and depletion problems at mines will accelerate. Also, geological constraints surrounding copper deposits will also contribute to major problems. Until the mid-2000s, a 0.4% copper cut-off grade was typical when determining what was mineable ore versus waste rock at large mines. By 2014, the average cutoff starts to get reduced from 0.4% to 0.25%. Lowering the grade cutoff, adds hypothetical tonnage but pulling more material out of the ground requires much more capital thus it become smuch costlier to produce the same amount of copper. Keep in mind as you read this thesis that Arizona Metals currently uses an unusually high 2.5% copper grade cutoff (more detail below).

Another factor to consider is that much of the worlds current copper supply comes from South America. Recent social unrest in Latin American nations has been creating a wave of anti-mining protests and fear of government nationalisation. Peru is starting to see this first hand as mine workers continue violent protests. The Chilean Escondida mine recently experienced a 44 day strike causing $740 million in losses- with the fear of new strikes always present and around the corner. History has shown that political unrest tends to spill over into neighbouring countries. As the price of commodities increases, governments will be more likely to try and take control of their domestic resources. Making the investment landscape unfavorable and thus risking the supply of future copper as miners seek more business-friendly jurisdictions such as Arizona. Political risk exists everywhere, Arizona Metals mgmt has been actively engaging local politicians, communities and indigenous populations for initial social license and approvals.

Political and economic tension between the US and China are pushing these nations in a race to secure steady resource supplies. High profile examples include Zijin Mining (among others) have already started scooping copper assets such as Nevsun and initiated partnerships with Ivanhoe Mines in Congo. A Chinese consortium recently acquired Las Bambas from Glencore. And the 2016 acquisition of the Tenke Fungurume mine from Freeport by China Moly. We will likely see more pressure to secure good assets going forward.

**Historical Asset:**

Within 200km of Arizona Metals' land, there are multiple mines that go over 2km in depth and that have yielded billions of pounds of copper over the years- many of which have been producing assets for years, requiring eventual replacement of new nearby ore. The flagship Kay Mine VMS project was previously owned by Exxon in the 1980s who reported an historic resource of 5.8Mt at 2.8g/t Au, 2.2% Cu, 3.03% Zn, 55 g/t Ag. The grade cut-off currently being used is 2.5% eqCu (determined back when copper was only 60 cents!). As we have seen above, most industry grade cutoff's being used are significantly LOWER. Moving the cutoff to 1% (as management has indicated during recent interviews) would still be conservative relative to peers but would add significant tonnage to any professional valuation model. The Sugarloaf Peak project is also 100% owned, no future payments, with a historic estimate of 100MMt containing 1.5M oz Au @ 0.5 g/t is a heap-leach, open-pit target that starts at surface.

Historic results known from prior Exxon ownership are shown below. We see two clear legs of mineralization. Back when Exxon owned this asset, Zinc was not valuable and so the company did not explore these zones further. Fast forward 40 years and Zinc has appreciated greatly. Following the recent June 30th drill results, from their ongoing 75,000 m drill program,

the market was surprised to see wider, and continuous, high-grade gold/zinc hits filling the area between the two original legs (an area that was thought to have minimal or non-existent mineralization) adding significant tonnage.

&#x200B;

AMC currently has 4 drill rigs on site as of Q4. The company is aiming to continue their 75,000m drilling program, in which they originally expected to target a 15-18Mt resource by year end but following recent results Mgmt feels they are already at around 15-20Mt, now targeting closer to 40Mt by year end. The market can expect to be provided with monthly press releases

outlining about 4-6 hole results. With 4 rigs, the company is well-funded for at least 2 years, no risk of financing in short term.

**Meaningful Growth Catalysts:**

The real torque upside lies in further discovery at Central and West. VMS deposits occur in clusters, there are now close to 60 other historic VMS mines in this general area, together with the initial surveying, mgmt and existing investors are confident of resource expansion. Both of these targets are expected to be tested this fall.

Though continued drilling and expansion of the Kay Mine is low hanging fruit that will contribute to an already deeply discounted valuation, the size of Kay is only a fraction of the story. VMS deposits typically occur in clusters, with AMC having nearly 20 VTEM/Geophysical survey anomalies to test- that have yet to ever be tried. The Central and West targets are two significant upside options being offered for free to current stock investors.

To emphasize the potential of the Central and West targets, ive included two screenshots from AMCs website (below). The first image shows the current 320m Kay mine footprint on the right, in red. The latest depth was 750m, complete depth is uncertain at this time as we expect further deeper drill results. Keep in mind that this region is known for multiple copper rich deposits. The 600m Central target is the purple VTEM area in the middle and the 1km Western target can be seen by the purple VTEM area on the left.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nbirf1na5381.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=512a2f4483ea30475befd36ea95ee7fac5372a90

The second image is to show rock and soil anomalies. As copper (polymetallic metals) sit in the ground for hundreds of millions of years, they oxidize, and those gases rise to the surface. They alter the composition of what is sitting on surface and these “gossans” can be tested, and are a strong indicator there is mineralization below. As you can see, it was true at the Kay Deposit. Significant upside can be unlocked if it holds true at the untested Central and West targets. Permits to build roads and drill pads for the Central and West are expected to be acquired within weeks.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1osbvdnla5381.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9433541ec2a1d3cfe602bf414f97d0c16b01037f

The stock is already deeply undervalued; at current prices you get to own Kay Mine at a discount and a free option on Sugarloaf, Central and West targets. The recent raise of capital

will no doubt be used to accelerate testing of these targets. Upcoming drill results from this area will completely shock the rest of the market. Only the few investors following will be rewarded.

**Funding/shareholder base:**

The company is well funded, with about $60M CAD on hand now with another $10 Million coming from warrant exercises over the next year. There is no risk of a dilutive equity raise in the next two years at least. However, if BHP/FCX/JOGMEC/etc wanted 10-20% of the company this type of dilution would receive a warm welcome. Having most recently raised $32M CAD in an upsized bought-deal financing on October 22 (NO warrant Component), $21M CAD on 04/06/2021 (@ $2.10 + ½ warrant) and an earlier raise of $10M on 01/04/2021 (@ $0.95)). The recent raise appears to have been driven by eager strategic investors looking to get meaningful positions via deal before the company starts drilling West and Central. Keep an eye on upcoming holder filings, we could see some new names appear. Proceeds are going to be used to expand current assets and start drilling of West and Central- something the market has zero knowledge/expectation of at the moment.

The shareholder base is still light but existing holders are sophisticated investors known for their ability to spot the best opportunities in the space. Their intent is to hold homeruns for long-term multi-bag upside potential, not quick trades. Recent filings indicate the following holders:

1)Michael Gentile- 5 million shares- 5.5% (ran one of the most successful mkt neutral funds in Canada. Focuses on mining and resource investments)  
2)Chairman Paul Reid top holder 3%

3) President/CEO- Marc Pais- 3%

4))ASA Gold and Precious Metals Fund- 2.64% (but only 1.7% of their fund, small relative to other positions)

5)Invesco Gold & Special Minerals Fund- 2.5% (but only 0.33% of their net assets, very small position size relative to average sizing in fund- room for growth)

6)1832 Asset Mgmt -1.64% (another dedicated resource investor adding a new position to portfolio but a tiny weight. For now...)

7)RBC AM Global Precious Metals Fund- 0.9% (HUGE fund, new position, room to grow)  
8) US Global Investors- 0.7% (savvy, well respected investors, new position)

The stock has drifted lower due to recent profit taking and lack of marginal buying in the short term. The few investors that have been involved in this name (plus a few hedge funds) have not had much marginal demand bidding the stock higher. Also, there is an overhang of warrants that expire in a few months. Since the last deal, 5M warrants were issued at an exercise price of $3 with April 2022 expiration. With the recent uptick in volumes, I’m confident that some investors from the recent deals have already started exercising warrants funded by selling deal stock, given they are in the money. Meanwhile, most investors are likely using cash to exercise the warrants and hold long term. The recent trading volumes and block action indicate that the warrant overhang, if any, may have been cleaned up. Easy supply will be difficult to come by.

Institutions and retail investors will need to accumulate stock in the open market. Early volumes were light, it didn't take much trading to get this stock up above $3.50 USD. The fundamentals of the story are unchanged and continue to point to a growing resource, with current pricing offering free upside option on any discovery at the nearby targets.

Now that the story is proving itself and attracting credible investors, attention and awareness of this story will only attract more investment. The only negative comments I hear from investors as to why they don't want to buy the stock now is because of the one year price rally from $0.80 to $3.50 USD (on low volume). Countless investors have been left in the dust, hoping a stock would dip lower before entering. Check out the copper stock charts below that kept going UP,\] to become billion+ dollar market cap companies. Just because the stock has already run up a bit doesn't mean it shouldn't be a core holding if there is still significant upside. The earliest and riskiest stage is behind us, consider this an opportunity for up to 1000% upside now that the story is de-risked. Below are the valuation scenarios that will show the clear upside of this stock.

&#x200B;

[SLS, EMO, CS, ERO, IVN, TECK\/b](https://preview.redd.it/4x64ugdpa5381.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1ff4702453445139f0e5fc4663e0e46117c9001)

**VALUE IS BACKSTOPPED BY FUNDAMENTALS**

To emphasise the deep value, the following valuation scenarios assume the same grades as the historic resource, with the following recoveries and commodity prices (chart below). Management has openly indicated that they are confident in a current 15-20Mt resource and are now targeting 40Mt by year end, with a consistent amount of drill results expected to be released monthly (expect 6-7 holes released monthly). For scale- If the anticipated drill holes in the next press release are as wide and similar grade as the recent release, it’s not unreasonable to see millions of tonnes added.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ycu2mhmta5381.png?width=255&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=41c9d9f5c1f9988b5dde7d3447736406b5f81c6f

The Worst case scenario uses SOLELY the historic resource identified by Exxon in the 1980s to show the clear valuation backstop. The Base Case focuses only on the current Kay Mine asset, using the same cutoff grades and recoveries- which havent been changed since copper was 60 cents. Consider how quickly the valuation will change as the model adds new resource tonnage

either by discovery or by simply lowering the cutoff grade to something more inline with the rest of the market peers. These are low hanging fruit that are not being modelled by the street analysts. To show how conservative the 2.5% CuEq grade is at AMC consider this: Eagle Mountain Mining, a nearby copper exploration play in Arizona is using 1.5% cutoff relative to AMC at 2.5%...A conservative lowering of the cutoff is an easy way to almost double the resource. Also, keep in mind my model below uses two discount rates to determine the NPV: 5 and 10% to be completely conservative.

1143,Need for a new PLAYBOOK on stock market analysis," A New Metric to analyze and predict the future price of stocks is here, whether we like it or not. I am talking about quantified social media sentiments. The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.

**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.

Over the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else’s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?

As a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:

1\] Technical Analysis 

2\] Fundamental Analysis 

3\] Social Signals 

and then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. 

Currently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",2021-12-02 14:26:38

1147,Super-Bearish Catalysts of Market Losses!,"**I've received messages this week from friends of mine who saw their portfolios fall sharply. Others who were on the sidelines with large cash positions saw a number of the world's most promising companies drop by 20%, 30%, and as much as 50% in just a couple of weeks.**  


By looking at the major indices that are heavily influenced by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Netflix, Nvidia, and Tesla, you're not seeing the true scope of the situation.  


**Most retail investors and Wall Street funds don't hold most of their wealth in the S&P 500. They own high-growth stocks, such as the ones that Cathie Wood has in her ETFs.**  


In 2020 and 2021, an entire generation of millennials and Generation Z demographics bought stocks for the first time. AMC, GME, and other meme stocks attracted tens of millions of people to the markets, and fundamentals didn't matter (on the upside). It now seems valuations don’t matter (on the downside).  


**Look at the price drops in these well-loved names:**  


Lemonade (insurance disruptor): -76% since February, currently at an all-time low.  
The Honest Company (founded by actress Jessica Alba): -66% since May, currently at an all-time low.  
DocuSign (dominant e-signature platform): -56% since July, currently dropped 44% in ONE DAY following reports.  
Affirm Holdings (FinTech disruptor): -36% this month.  
Invitae (Cathie Wood darling pick): -73% since February, currently at 3-year lows.  
Teladoc (telehealth disruptor): -68% since February, currently near 3-year lows.  


**All of the major Chinese stocks have been obliterated off the map as well!**  


A year like this proves, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the importance of investing in the indices alongside any stock-picking one does.  


**If you were looking for an opportunity to enter the markets after the insane bubble of 2020, know that the retail mania is dead.**  


It's absolutely true that millennials love stocks as a pastime, but they now understand that 2020 was a fluke and not the norm.  


Buying the dip always feels like a sucker's game when in the middle of a correction, but timing the market is not as important as time in the market.  


**Fundamentally, what's happening in the markets is the notion that in the next year (2022), inflation will still be high, but that the trend is weakening, so 2023 and beyond will be deflationary.**  


Because of this, tech growth stocks that aren't profitable yet are being sold off. Inflation is the enemy of growth since it means that paying for future profits must discount the depreciation in fiat currency.  


**On the flip side, value stocks that distribute a dividend are highly praised.**  


If you're buying disruption stocks, prices now are very cheap, but they might stay like that for a whole year, so be strategic about it.  


**Markets are certain that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in June 2022, and we think that this won't be a surprise. Gold is already pushing forward, and I think we might be nearing an important bottom.**  


If we get one last sell-off, I'll be there buying my favorite mining stocks and going into what I think is going to be a wild 2022 for miners.

One on the top of my list is **Callinex Mines (TSX-V:CNX, OTC:CLLXF)** which have caught the attention of smart-money investors.

&#x200B;

This is a miner with multiple high-conviction properties, including Manitoba’s Flin Flon District with Callinex’s high-grade copper, gold, silver, and zinc-rich Rainbow Deposit that is being rapidly expanded right now.

&#x200B;

Additionally, the company is advancing two near-surface silver discoveries in close proximity to its Nash Creek deposit in the Bathurst Mining District of New Brunswick. A 2018 PEA on its Bathurst Project portfolio outlined a mine plan that generates a strong economic return with a pre-tax IRR of 34.1% and NPV8% of $230 million.

&#x200B;

This is a small miner with huge potential: A $52 million market cap and no debt whatsoever are features that enhance the excellent reward-to-risk profile of Callinex Mines today.

&#x200B;

Clearly, Callinex Mines should be at the top of any resource investors’ watch list – and with inflation set to ramp up much higher, this is a company to ride coming wave of interest in inflation-resistant hard assets.

1152,Psycho Market Recap for Thur Dec 9 2021,"**Summary**

The three day rally in the stock market took a pause, with stocks finishing mostly lower. Market participants continue to digest new data about the Omicron variant, the Weekly Unemployment Report, and look forward to new inflation data being released tomorrow. Weekly unemployment claims showed lowest level since 1969 with 184k claims vs 220k expected.

Investors continue to assess the risks of Omicron infections, with mixed news about the severity of illness and its response to vaccines. Bloomberg reported that the Omicron variant was found to be 4.2 times more transmissible in its early form compared to the Delta variant. However, reports continue to suggest the severity of the disease is less than originally feared and new early lab results from Pfizer (PFE) showed a third booster shot “neutralizes” the variant.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/health/pfizer-booster-omicron.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/health/pfizer-booster-omicron.html)

Bank of America Senior US Equity Strategist Jill Carey said, “The Omicron variant has obviously been a key variable that contributed to the sell-off that we saw, and a lot of uncertainty remains around that, but our colleagues are so far thinking that while much is yet to be known, so far signs point to it not affecting the course of the pandemic dramatically, but obviously there is still a lot we need to hear there.

With virus concerns diminishing, investors are pivoting their attention back to economic data, awaiting Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures on Friday to assess the extent inflationary pressures will persist.

""If the Omicron variant was to lead to a resurgence in goods spending at the expense of services or to further complicate supply disruptions, there could be a clear inflationary impact, too,” wrote HSBC economist James Pomeroy earlier this week in a research note to clients. “The inflation news in the past few weeks has been decidedly mixed — with upside surprises in both the U.S. and eurozone being offset by the possibility of some of the supply chain issues starting to alleviate, while energy prices have fallen sharply in recent days.

**Highlights**

* Lucid Motors (LCID) cratered more than 15% after the company announced it was offering $1.75 billion of convertible senior notes expected to be sold to institutional buyers in a private offering. The decline marks the second nosedive this week for shares of Lucid, which hovered around bear market territory Monday following disclosure of an investigation by the SEC.
* Shares of Nu Holdings, a Warren Buffet backed Brazilian fin-tech company, IPOd today, closing the day roughly 15% higher. 
* Latest figures from the Commerce Department released Thursday showed wholesale inventories rose 2.3%, slightly more than the 2.2% estimated last month and 14.4% up from a year earlier, as companies stock up for the holiday season.
* Bad day for meme stocks. Gamestop (GME) stock declined roughly 10% after the company reported earnings. AMC was down roughly 8% in sympathy as well. 
* The chief executives of major U.S. retailers including Target Home Depot, Kroger, CVS Health, Autozone and Best Buy urged Congress to take action to address the online sale of stolen, counterfeit and dangerous consumer products.
* Newly released films from Universal Studios will stream exclusively on Peacock streaming service
* Snap (SNAP) launched a new program on Tuesday named “523,” a new content accelerator program for smaller, minority-owned content companies. This new program will award 20 minority-owned media upstarts $10,000 per month for six months to help them create content.

1155,(12/10) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"#Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the final trading day of this week. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-

*****

#[Stock futures are positive ahead of key inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Friday as investors braced for an inflation report that is expected to show prices at their highest level in nearly 40 years.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 85 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
> Markets expect a high inflation reading, which could lead the Federal Reserve to hasten the taper of its $120-billion monthly bond-buying program. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.7% gain for the month of November, which would translate to a year-over-year growth rate of 6.7%. If that is the case, it will mark the biggest move since June 1982.
*****
> Oracle shares soared, gaining more than 11% premarket, a day after beating earnings on the top and bottom lines.
*****
> Southwest Airlines dropped 2.5% in premarket trading following another downgrade on Wall Street, this time from Goldman Sachs. The industry has been deemed susceptible to inflation risk, and Alaska Air Group also was off Friday, falling 2.7%.
*****
> Interactive fitness company Peloton added to its woes, dropping 2.7% premarket after tumbling 11.3% on Thursday. Credit Suisse cut its view on the company, saying a return to gyms and shifts in consumer spending will weigh on profitability.
*****
> The moves came after the major averages ended the regular trading session lower, each snapping a three-day win streak. The Dow, moved less than a point lower, finishing at the flatline. The S&P 500 fell 0.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7%. Nevertheless, all are on track to finish the week higher.
*****
> Jobless claims data released on Thursday showed the labor market recovery remains strong. The Labor Department reported initial claims for unemployment insurance totaled 184,000, below the 211,000 estimated by economists surveyed by Dow Jones and the lowest reading since 1969.
*****
> Trading was largely muted as investors await more data from the Labor Department, which will release the November consumer price index on Friday. It was the market’s second day of pause, following the two-day market rally earlier this week as they turned their attention to the economic data instead.
*****
> The University of Michigan is also set to release consumer sentiment data on Friday, which AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk said he’s also following closely as it appears at odds with inflation levels.
*****
> “Sentiment seems to be really at lows, yet consumer shopping and retail strength seems to be quite strong, so there’s a mismatch there,” he said. “We think the proof is really at the cash register. As long as we’re seeing strong consumer shopping, employers continuing to bring people back to work, bigger picture we remain much more bullish moving toward the end of the year.”

#[Stock futures are positive ahead of key inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Friday as investors braced for an inflation report that is expected to show prices at their highest level in nearly 40 years.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 85 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
> Markets expect a high inflation reading, which could lead the Federal Reserve to hasten the taper of its $120-billion monthly bond-buying program. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.7% gain for the month of November, which would translate to a year-over-year growth rate of 6.7%. If that is the case, it will mark the biggest move since June 1982.
*****
> Oracle shares soared, gaining more than 11% premarket, a day after beating earnings on the top and bottom lines.
*****
> Southwest Airlines dropped 2.5% in premarket trading following another downgrade on Wall Street, this time from Goldman Sachs. The industry has been deemed susceptible to inflation risk, and Alaska Air Group also was off Friday, falling 2.7%.
*****
> Interactive fitness company Peloton added to its woes, dropping 2.7% premarket after tumbling 11.3% on Thursday. Credit Suisse cut its view on the company, saying a return to gyms and shifts in consumer spending will weigh on profitability.
*****
> The moves came after the major averages ended the regular trading session lower, each snapping a three-day win streak. The Dow, moved less than a point lower, finishing at the flatline. The S&P 500 fell 0.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7%. Nevertheless, all are on track to finish the week higher.
*****
> Jobless claims data released on Thursday showed the labor market recovery remains strong. The Labor Department reported initial claims for unemployment insurance totaled 184,000, below the 211,000 estimated by economists surveyed by Dow Jones and the lowest reading since 1969.
*****
> Trading was largely muted as investors await more data from the Labor Department, which will release the November consumer price index on Friday. It was the market’s second day of pause, following the two-day market rally earlier this week as they turned their attention to the economic data instead.
*****
> The University of Michigan is also set to release consumer sentiment data on Friday, which AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk said he’s also following closely as it appears at odds with inflation levels.
*****
> “Sentiment seems to be really at lows, yet consumer shopping and retail strength seems to be quite strong, so there’s a mismatch there,” he said. “We think the proof is really at the cash register. As long as we’re seeing strong consumer shopping, employers continuing to bring people back to work, bigger picture we remain much more bullish moving toward the end of the year.”

1160,Why did 2021 turn out to be a bad year for new investors,"I know GME$ AMC$ meme stocks kicked off 2021 in high gear and then came to a halt around March. 

But overall individual stocks did horrible in 2021. 

Was this becuase of delta? 
Was it evergrande?
Was it tech stocks going down?
Was it inflation?
Was it Americans not wanting to return to work?
Was it COVID payments stopping on September 4, 2021?
Was it people taking their money out of stocks and investing it into digital coins?

I’m sure I’m missing a bunch of things but genuinely curious to know why 2021 was bad year for newbie’s like me.l?

Seasoned vets seemed to do fine, hell my neighbor said it was his best year investing since he can remember. Props to the veterans out there.

I’m carrying multiple bags that I’ll doubt I’ll ever go positive on before these companies declare bankruptcy",2021-12-13 09:53:16

Super undervalued story as is. Reposting a link to someone elses original DD:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Miningstocks/comments/r79jxr/amcv\_azmcf\_us\_arizona\_metals\_will\_make\_me\_a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miningstocks/comments/r79jxr/amcv_azmcf_us_arizona_metals_will_make_me_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  


The original story does not change, this stock is extremely undervalued but now GDXJ will be plowing into this stock soon as they will require shares equivalent to 0.42% weight of their $4.4 billion USD index. Equates to about 4.5-4.6 million shares of demand assuming current prices. That is equivalent to 14 days worth of volume!!!

1165,(12/14) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, December 14th, 2021-

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
> Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
> Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
> Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
> The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
> Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
> “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
> Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
> “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
> The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
> During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
> Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
> While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
> Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
> Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
> “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

1167,The Meme Stock Boom is Over,"Shares of GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) plummeted on Monday, signaling a potential end to the meme stock trade that dominated 2021.

Numbers: Both GameStop and AMC, the two darlings of the meme stock trade, posted multi-month lows as part of a larger market selloff on Monday. GameStop fell 13.96% and AMC dropped 15.31%.

Catalyst: Most of the meme stocks have been fading in recent weeks. The short squeezes that played a role in the rise of meme stocks are no longer as prominent. Additionally, investors have become less interested in these meme names.

Glass Half Full: AMC and GameStop have produced slightly better-than-expected earnings this quarter. There is still some optimism that both companies can bounce back.

Final Thoughts: Despite recent losses, both AMC and GameStop are still up by a lot this year.

1171,Thoughts on AMC? (NOT as a m3me),"Would love to hear opinions on AMC as a real investment, not as a m3me stock.

I bought into AMC because of two reasons:

1. I believe (and still do) that movie theaters will continue to recover in attendance over time as we normalize into whatever COVID is going to normalize into. The recent dip in the stock tells me it’s not baked into the price anymore at least. Still, I am optimistic about movie magic combined with the antsy-ness of a population stuck at home for further gains on attendance. Here’s a quick graph showing why I believe this so strongly: [https://www.the-numbers.com/market/](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/). Even if it never recovers to pre-pandemic levels, which I feel it will, there's still plenty of growth left.
2. I really loved the A-List program. Many people I know have started to adopt it, observed over the last several years. When I had free time, I’d go see multiple movies per month and felt it was a great deal. Now that I don’t, I still keep the sub around because I feel that I might. Classic subscription benefit for the company. Also being able to book for my friends without having to do the Venmo runaround is great, esp for sell out MCU premieres.
3. I see AMC as a medium term play. Is it a sustainable business over the long term and will movie going see long term growth over the next 5-10 years? Maybe, but I'm not willing to bet on that. I am willing to bet that there will be a stock bump from an attendance resurgence as we recover from COVID, so something more like a bet of 1-3 years.

I wanted to share my opinion and see who agreed or disagreed with me and why.",2021-12-15 15:15:33

1174,News: Why Betting Against AMC Stock Is Still a Bad Idea,,2021-12-17 14:52:32
1175,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, December 17, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5.",2021-12-17 17:08:57

1177,Hedging Stock Scalping with Options,"I typically scalp via futures for efficiency, however for smaller scalps, I’ve started experimenting with using stocks (since commissions are now gone). Today I was scalping AMC (I maintain volume and momentum scanners for meme stocks), first when it was up around 4.8%. 

I’ve found that using short calls to hedge deltas against long stock to work really well. Today I was buying 500-1,000 share tranches and built up to a 70% hedge via 31Dec 35C (these ranged from .20 to .40 delta throughout the day.  

I flattened the stock position by the end of the day and parsed down the short calls to a 10 lot and spread it off. The trade is on for free and if AMC ramps volume early next week, my thought is I can use the existing free hedge to begin building a intraday trade. 

Has anyone else tried a similar strategy? What expirations do you tend to use for the short call hedge?",2021-12-18 01:12:29

Omicron and Mr. Manchin’s rejection of Biden’s “Build Back Better” sent the market spiraling down for one of its worst days in the already Bearish December. The crude oil tumbled as well losing 6% midday and closing at 3% in the red. 

WSB’s favorite meme stocks were all in red for most of the day continuing the worsening December trend for the meme/growth stocks. GME was up by almost one percent at the close picking up some momentum at the end though well short on the average volume. AMC, despite opening in green following the bumper opening of Spider Man: No way home, reversed mid-morning and finally closed at 2% on the up. Another favorite of the memes, Palantir, plunged by more than 5% to close almost at its 52 week low.

Pandemic favorites Zoom was in green for most of the day and Chegg finished up at less than one percent, as stay at home and lockdowns were being announced in Europe and seems to be increasingly possible in this side of the Atlantic as well. 

Carnival Cruise Line (CCL) rose today by 3% after the Company said it expects to be profitable in the second half of 2022 despite rising Omicron cases worldwide.

Moderna shares were briefly up as the Pharma company’s booster shots provide better protection against Omicron by increasing the antibodies 37-fold. But along with the rest of the market the company’s shares went down in red and closed 6% down.

Shares of Rocket Companies (Rocket Mortgage’s parent) plunged more than 6% following the acquisition of Finance App TrueBill for $1.28 Bn. This acquisition will help the company to improve upon its image as a FinTech player and not just a mortgage company. Truebill is a finance management application that analyses spending habits, identifies inefficiencies and offers methods to improve financial health. It has 2.5 million members and is expected to add $100 million in annual recurring revenue to Rocket’s $1.3 Billion of annualized servicing fee income.",2021-12-20 16:52:05

Pfizer’s antiviral COVID-19 pill for at-risk people aged 12 and above was authorized by the FDA , making it the first oral treatment which can be taken at home, providing a potentially important tool in the fight against the fast-spreading Omicron variant.

The pill, called Paxlovid, was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to data from the company's clinical trial. Recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against Omicron, Pfizer said.

Omicron has overtaken other coronavirus variants to become the dominant strain in the U.S., and now accounts for about three-quarters of new infections, according to the CDC. To fight this, the Biden administration announced it was buying 500 million at-home rapid coronavirus tests that Amercians will be able to order online for free starting in January.

In the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was revised higher. Analysts now expect GDP to show a 2.3% annualized increase in economic activity in Q3, up from the 2.1% rise previously estimated.

The Conference Board’s highly anticipated Consumer Confidence Index report showed a greater than expected increase in December. The institution's headline index crept higher to 115.8 in December, based on the latest release. This was above the 111.0 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.

Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said “Consumer confidence improved further in December, following a very modest gain in November. Expectations about short-term growth prospects improved, setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, major appliances, and vacations over the next six months all increased.”

She continued, “Meanwhile, concerns about inflation declined after hitting a 13-year high last month as did concerns about COVID-19, despite reports of continued price increases and the emergence of the Omicron variant,"" Franco added. Looking ahead to 2022, both confidence and consumer spending will continue to face headwinds from rising prices and an expected winter surge of the pandemic.”

**Highlights**

**Dow:**  **35,950.56 (+196.67) (+0.55%)**

**Nasdaq: 15,653.37 (+131.48) (+0.85%)**

In time for the Holiday, the US markets cheered up with the S&P closing at a new record and shrugging off the worries that troubled in the beginning of the week. Fueled by optimism on the impeding Santa Claus rally next week the indices posted back-to-back sessions gains with most of the stocks in the green. The VIX continued to dip reflecting the market sentiment and closed at the lowest levels since the Thanksgiving weekend.

Tesla built upon the momentum of Musk’s closure of share sales and further buoyed by positive estimates of various analysts on the Q4 Tesla delivery numbers, jumped another 5% today to close at $1,067. The One Trillion Dollar EV maker promised to disable in-car videogame after US Highway safety regulator launched an investigation into the same.

Crocs shares plunged by more than 11% after the company said it has agreed to purchase casual-shoe brand Heydude for $2.5 Billion ($2.05 Bn in cash and $450 Mn in Crocs shares). Heydude makes ultra-light casual shoes that has seen digital sales increase 14x since 2018.

Shares of Micron Technology jumped another 4.5% today marking an impressive 15% gains since their stellar earnings report and positive management commentary. The stock closed at above $94 closely approaching its 52-week high price.  

Airlines and Cruise stocks had an impressive week despite the Omicron variant raging across the US and the world. In the last 5 trading days Carnival Cruise was up by more than 20% and AAL, DAL and UAL were all up around 10% with domestic travel remaining strong in the holiday season.

Electric semitruck maker Nikola’s shares surged by 18% on the news of their first customer delivery. The company’s shares closed at $11.09 still at a far-lower level than its mid-2020 levels.

Short-Squeeze Argument

&#x200B;

1. SI is above >20% again making it a squeeze case      again. All that needed is retail volume. 
2. Highly oversold currently and historical January effect      always pushes the stocks throughout the month
3. Cathie Wood and Ark Investment have started to keep an      eye on Prog. The moment they take a position, it will definitely shoot the      stock price up.
4. Anytime the news/PR of Preecludia will drop that will definitely      be giving a boost to price since this development captures market worth      billions of dollars (3B+ market)
5. Prog just crossing the accumulation phase of Wyckoff      (2.13-2.16 range) is where October Wyckoff started and then went to $6.20.      As per Charts, if volume comes in, it will go above $7.80-$8.30 this time      without news

Buyout Argument

&#x200B;

1. Management is dead silent and isn't defending stock      price at all. Usually the case when BO is an option and management doesn't      care about current market price or feels the need to defend (Look at other      companies defending stock prices, Tesla, AMC,GME, ATER and many more.)
2. Management is loading off the assets to focus on core      business- another sign for a clean BO.
3. Company cleared debts in form of shares instead of cash      payments- another sign that debt is being reduced and creditors are ok      accepting shares
4. Executives accepting their compensation at higher prices      (CEO has shares at $3.11) while market prices keeps being hammered down
5. Their largest shareholder accumulating shares after      days of  dips- Athyrium accumulated      millions of shares from November to December - wants the largest piece of      pie by shaking retail holders.
6. Prog appointed a director who worked for Pfizer before      and has Merger & Acquisition expertise soon after Prog signed its 3rd      partnership with a big pharma
7. Pfizer was in news multiple times seeking acquisitions in      the industry (arna being the first one)

**Catalysts:**

&#x200B;

1. 3 Confirmed signed partnerships with big pharma. PR was      supposed to be out in days as per CEO words but we can clearly see someone      is pulling the strings (Athyrium )
2. My best guess is Pfizer, JnJ, and AbbVie are the partners      , however , Moderna, Merck could also be in the game.
3. Preeecludia PR is expected to be out in coming week.      Expected Topline PK/PD data in last Quarter of 2021 (tomorrow starts the      last week).

**Athyrium** actions to control the price

   
 

&#x200B;

1. If you look at Prog documentation, it’s clear that      Athyrium can do shorting whenever they want which is happening      aggressively since last run.
2. Barcoding and stop loss hunt happening all over again.
3. Sudden ATM offer when retail pushed Prog higher is      another proof that Athyrium attempted to take control back.
4. 3-5 cents move on the daily again with lower volume      which is again the perfect strategy Athyrium was using before.

P.S: you can review my previous posts  to see that I was 100% right on barcoding and stop loss hunt and its shares accumulation strategy. It is just becoming more aggressive which means some big news will be out soon and retail will be left out",2021-12-26 16:54:19

1191,"New to trading, but i had a great first experience with AMC last week.","So like i said, im new to this. But last week I saw some ppl tweeting about AMC, and i seen that it was at the bottom of a dip. And it was simple enough to me by looking at the 3month chart to see that it would go back up soon. Especially because i was hella excited for Spider-Man, and everyone else i knew was too. So I put in $200, and a couple days later i sold it at around $260 when i saw it starting to plateau. 

That was easy! I was like damn, I’ll take a 30% win every few days lol, for sure. 

But my question is, is there a redditor, certain news account, or twitter, which gathers relevant info (like the Spider-Man premier) for stuff relevant to stocks — and suggests which stocks to buy and when?

Just some practical little 20% gains over a few days. Or was that just blind luck and it’s not a regular occurrence? 

Also please, share any and all resources you believe a new trader should get familiar with",2021-12-28 00:27:42

I paper traded for one month and started live trading in June 2020 with a $1500 account. As someone using TradeZero International (non-US based) there are no PDT rule restrictions for under $25k accounts. After reloading several times (total deposits under $10k) I became profitable from January 2021.

* Started 01/01/2021 with $1800 account equity
* 160 green days
* 91 red days

# Trading Style

## Market

Primarily daytrading US equities both long and short. Recently started expanding to short term swing trading and simple option strategies (long call, long put).

## Stock Selection

I trade most stocks that have volume and volatility, from small cap low float gappers to large caps. When I started off with a small account I primarily traded sub $10 stocks. Now I have moved onto midcaps and higher priced stocks since I don't want to pay as much short locate fees.

Every stock trades differently, some trade cleaner than others than others. For example, tickers like AMC and TSLA have plenty of volume and liquidity, respects technical levels often, leading to frequent opportunities on a daily basis.

## Style

I believe there are many different profitable ways to trade, from scalping to swing trading, shorting parabolics to buying dips. You can find edge in any strategy. I would describe my style as:

* Rooted in technical analysis
* Price action based
* Discretionary systematic

General types of trade setups:

* Breakouts, breakdowns (from ranges)
* Mean reversion on ""extension"" (reversals, short and long)
* Trend following

## Indicators

Chart

* Standard candlestick chart - using various time intervals
* VWAP - session, anchored
* Moving averages - simple, exponential
* Volume
* Volume profile with point of control (PoC)

Market sentiment

* SPY - relevant for large caps and market names
* IWM - relevant for small caps
* VIX - volatility index
* BTCUSD - when trading crypto stocks

## Level 2, Time & Sales/Tape

My entries are 100% based off the chart. I always have Level 2 (market depth) and Time & Sales (tape) on screen with the order windows and look at them but they are not crucial for me. I can read tape but would not say I'm good at it.

## Fundamentals

Fundamentals can be important: when trading small caps many are not ""great"" companies and often dilute shares to the public market which can affect the price of the stock. In large caps, news events and earnings can drive volatility, so understanding these earnings reports can help. I only have a basic understanding of SEC filings, offerings and other dilution, as there are many tools out there that help with this. Fundamental knowledge can help with understanding why a stock is moving/gapping but technical analysis is still key in timing entries and exits. In trading, being early is the same as being wrong.

## Risk

My risk and scaling strategy is pretty basic compounding: max risk per trade is 2% of my current equity, which I adjust at the beginning of each trading day.

* At $1,500 account my risk per trade was $30.
* At $25,000 it was $500.
* At $50,000 it was $1000 etc.

Since there is a discretionary aspect to my trading I don't take the same risk every single trade. For example I may risk 1% on okay setups, 2% risk on great setups, and on rare occassions 3% on A+ setups. Look up Kelly criterion to understand why 2% is often used by many systems.

## R/R & winrate

There are lots of threads out there on this topic. The default consensus when people talk about RR is to only take trades with a RR higher than 2:1 as it allows you to be profitable with any winrate over 33%. As your RR decreases your winrate must be higher.

I sometimes take profit before 2R. I sometimes don't take any profit until after 2R. Obviously I try to aim for at least 2R+ targets in order to have a positive expectancy overall, but mostly I base my decisions off the chart and potential support/resistance zones, how price action is forming when inside the trade, so I do not rigidly take profit at fixed multiples of the risk amount.

## Review & Journalling

The process of reviewing is crucial to a trader's progression. People do it different ways; some people track large amounts of quantitive data in excel, others are more qualitative in their analysis of executions and charts.

I use TraderVue to import my trades daily and tag them with labels based on setups and characteristics. Every weekend I review my trades of the week, biggest winners, biggest losers and missed opportunities, annotating and screenshotting charts which are saved to a OneNote notebook.

* Twitter - news, other traders

* TradingView - scanner
* Finviz - scanner
* TradeZero - broker
* Discord - community
* Tradervue - journal
* OneNote - journal
* Excel - risk calculator
* DilutionTracker - fundamentals
* BamSEC - fundamentals

# Some advice to newer traders

* Find a mentor

Mentors have been through all the mistakes a beginner trader will encounter, and can offer invaluable advice to speed up the learning curve. Even so, nothing can replace real world experience and most traders will still go on to experience the same mistakes themselves before learning

* Join a community

Trading can be a solitary job. It can be beneficial to talk ideas with other traders. Communities/chatrooms are also good for idea generation, and acting as scanners. Essentially you have many other traders looking at similar stocks and talking about tradeable charts. You should not join chatrooms to chase alerts as the end goal is to become independent in your trading

* Put in the effort, accumulate screen time

For most trading days I have watched the charts for the majority of market hours (9:30 to 4:00). I say this to show the amount of screen time I have personally accumulated. On top of that the time spent on weekends reviewing and journalling trades, charting potential setups for the week ahead (even though a lot can change on Monday).

* Practice

Watching the markets is good, but nothing will beat real trading experience. I missed 2 trading days this year out of 252 days, with a total 8136 trades (granted, the first half of the year I was overtrading massively in learning stages)

* Start with very small capital while having a stable income

Growing 10k to 50k should be the same as growing 50k to 250k (for the most part, unless your strategy runs into liquidity issues). Prove you can do it with a smaller account first. Then you must conquer emotion and discipline once you are trading bigger dollar amounts.

It's easier to learn while having another source of income rather than trying to become profitable while living paycheck to paycheck on trading income.

## End

The best part about trading is that the only limit to your success is yourself. Compared to many other traders I am still only a beginner and have so much yet to learn. The potentials of trading are huge and my journey has only just begun. My goal next year is to cross $1M profits and keep scaling up.

Hope this helps those starting out just like I did in the beginning. Feel free to ask any questions! I also post trades & charts daily on my twitter [Valckrie](https://twitter.com/Valckrie)",2022-01-02 08:19:42
1194,ESSC: What is a gamma squeeze?,"[https://forums.ascendedtrading.com/](https://forums.ascendedtrading.com/)

Hello r/spacs. It has been a fine day in the stock market, and I've noticed across reddit, stocktwits, and twitter, that there seems to be a bit of confusion surrounding what a gamma squeeze is.

Let's clear that up right now.

To understand a gamma squeeze, a bit of options trading knowledge is required. A call option is the right to buy 100 shares of stock at a given price, called the strike price, within a given amount of time.

When an options trader or investor buys a call option, someone needs to be on the other side of the transaction and be willing to sell them the 100 shares. This other party is usually a market maker – traders who work for an exchange, bank or company and are mainly looking for small steady profits rather than accumulating a massive speculative bet (although they may do this as well).

When many people buy call options from a market maker, the market maker is effectively taking on a large short position in the stock. If the price of the stock rises, they face large losses. To mitigate this, they start buying the stock to hedge their short options position. This ironically has the effect of pushing the stock price up – the very thing they don’t want.

This is where gamma comes in, and to understand gamma, we need to understand delta. These terms are both known as ‘Greeks’, and they tell options traders how the option acts relative to the underlying stock.

**Delta** is how much the option price will move relative to a move in the underlying stock. For example, a delta of 0.3 means for each US dollar the stock price moves, the option premium will change by 0.3. Delta fluctuates from 0 to 1.

When a stock is trading well below a call option’s strike price, then the delta is near 0. The option premium doesn’t move much. When a stock is trading well above a call option’s strike price then the delta is near 1. For each US dollar the price moves, so will the option.

**Gamma** is the change in delta for each dollar the stock price moves.

Delta tells the market maker how much they need to hedge. Assume a market maker is short by issuing and selling 1,000 call contracts (100,000 shares) at a strike price of $10 and the stock is currently trading at $8. There is no danger to the market maker because the stock is below the strike price, and not even near it.

The delta may be 0 or 0.1 on a position like this, meaning the market doesn’t need to hedge at all, or they buy 10,000 shares as a partial hedge (delta of 0.1 x 100,000 shares). But if the stock price rises, delta approaches 0.5 at the strike price. Gamma measures this change.

The chart below shows a sample graph of what an options delta chart would look like for a long call option on a stock. A long call option gives its holder the right to buy 100 shares of stock at a given price, while the seller of the option will hold the reciprocal obligation to sell those shares at the exercise price. Looking to the chart, option delta is a nearly flat line around zero when a stock's price is well below the option's exercise price. It is also a nearly flat line around 1 when that stock's price is well above the option's exercise price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gk78djixvk981.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6869345871d98c4daece5b3c296c18825227e091

As the stock price rises the market maker must keep buying more stock, further fueling the rally, to adequately hedge. Delta can also be seen as the probability of an option expiring in the money, so for example, an option with a delta of 0.7 will have a 70% chance of expiring in the money. When the stock is at the strike price the market maker will usually have at least 0.5 of the position hedged, or 50,000 shares in order to cover off the 50% probability that the call will expire above the strike price and their exposure to potentially needing to deliver the shares to the call buyer. As the price keeps rising, so does delta, eventually reaching 1, which means the whole options position must be hedged. That means buying 100,000 shares.AMC Entertainment and GameStop are two examples of US stocks that experienced significant gamma squeezes.

In the case of AMC Entertainment and GameStop, both stocks were already being accumulated and hyped by WallStreetBets, a large group of retail traders in the popular discussion forum Reddit. Along with stock buying, hundreds of thousands of call options were purchased by retail investors, with the market makers on the other side of the trade.

As the prices of each stock rose, it created a gamma squeeze where the market makers were forced to buy the stocks and push both stocks prices up even more. It formed a vicious feedback loop, which resulted in GameStop jumping more than 2,000% in a couple weeks, and AMC Entertainment rallying close to 800%. The rally was also fuelled by hype, and not the gamma squeeze alone. The gamma squeeze helped to push the price up.

These examples can also be classified as a short squeeze​​ because there were large short positions in the stocks themselves.

Robinhood’s stock also experienced a gamma squeeze. Like the run-up in AMC Entertainment and GameStop, Robinhood became a ‘meme stock​’ with a lot of retail interest around it. Once again, this buying interest in the stock, coupled with large call option purchases, meant market makers were also forced to buy into an already escalating rally.

At the time in early August 2021, Robinhood had recently completed its IPO. Options on Robinhood commenced trading the day before a 50% stock price jump and gamma squeeze, resulting from the mass number of options that were purchased in the first two days of options trading.

One of the biggest examples of a gamma squeeze was when SoftBank, a Japanese technology investment company, earned the moniker “Nasdaq whale” after it bought billions of dollars’ worth of US equity derivatives in the technology sector in 2020. It had been buying massive amounts of call options on indices and ETFs as well as individual stocks like Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft, which stoked a feverish rally in tech stocks.

Are gamma squeezes a double-edged sword?

Gamma squeezes are sometimes referred to as a “double-edged sword” as they can propel prices in either direction. If the market maker has a short options position, then the price of the stock is pushed higher.

If the market maker has a net long options position, then they sell the stock to hedge, and the stock price is pushed lower. Trying to capitalise on this scenario is far less popular than where the stock price is squeezed higher.

Whether the gamma squeeze pushes a stock price up or down, the hedge does not need to last forever. As the options expire, or the hedge is no longer needed (or reduced) because delta changes, the stock price typically has a hard move back in the other direction. What goes up, comes back down.

How can I take advantage of gamma squeezes?

As the stock price rises, the gamma squeeze could help exacerbate the rally, which could lead to bigger profits on a long position.

A swift exit is a vital component to successfully capitalising on a gamma squeeze as the rally may not last long. Consider using a trailing stop loss or some other exit method that protects you from downside volatility and locks in some profit, so the profits are not all given back when the reversal move occurs. Managing your risk and guarding against downside volatility can also be a vital component to successfully trading a gamma squeeze.

Stocks are affected by multiple factors, not just gamma squeezes. That means a gamma squeeze won’t always result in a big move higher in stock prices, and big moves higher can occur without a gamma squeeze.

How this ties in with ESSC:

Today, ESSC experienced a runup that put a significant number of call options in the money, which in turn places pressure on market makers to hedge their positions by accumulating shares. This feedback loop will in turn raise the stock to even higher prices, with pressure increasing as more and more of the chain comes ITM.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vdygj6nzvk981.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce6156a96194b803f6ea95817e35e5198884b646

Currently, 214% of the float is accounted for by ITM options. Market makers will have to hedge for these calls, so long as they are held to expiration. Through hedging, buying pressure will increase, putting more strikes in the money, until every available strike is ITM.

When this happens, the market makers will open up new strikes on the options chain. We saw this happen in December, though the run was killed prematurely due to certain ""influencers"" dumping their positions and tweeting about it. This time, however, there is more powder. This setup is much more bullish than the previous runup in December, with most of the options being taken prior to the stock breaking $11.

After opening up new strikes, you can expect to see a lot of hedging during After hours and premarket, to get retail frothing at the mouth to enter new strikes. This is the day that ESSC will likely hit it's peak. However, if this were to occur significantly before options expiration, there is a chance depending on how retail responds to the chain extension, that the run can continue. That's really going to depend on how many options holders choose to take profit and/or roll up to higher strikes.

For this gamma squeeze to play out, market makers must be enticed to hedge. The entire chain should go ITM. There should be a significant options chain extension, and a huge rally in after hours the day before/of.

1197,Best Investments per Account?,"I've been trying to research this but haven't really found what I'm looking for. Are there certain types of investments that are most beneficial based on the account they're in?

FYI: I'm 22, have a Roth IRA, 401k, and taxable account, and eventually will have a HYSA/529 later in life. I have very minimal risk aversion.

My current portfolios:

Roth IRA: 100% VTSAX

401k: 45% VFIAX, 10% VSMAX, 10% VIMAX, 35% VTIAX

Taxable: a few shares of each BB, GME, AMC, MSFT, O, SCHD

My assumption is I want to just invest in the highest gaining potential stocks regardless of account. Is one kind of account better to invest in dividends vs etfs vs individual stocks vs bonds vs options though?

1198,How can I milk AMC shares/options with its current action? New (bag) holder here,"I'm looking to drop some of my amc but trying to break even or even profit if possible. I have 100 @ $29, 100 @ $40, 600 @ $50-55 (OUCH). I'm not in a rush to sell the 600 high cost shares and will just use them to sell OTM covered calls. I'm want to try high risk moves with the $29 and $40 shares I have. I'm fine if they get called away since I would at least break even. I was going to try to sell weekly $31 calls, but then of course the price tanked so the premiums dropped like a rock. IMO, AMC will tank to $19-20 before Jan 21 to keep most options OTM. But I don't know how to use this to my advantage. Yes I can buy puts, but it's honestly kinda late for that as they're too expensive now since stock is already at $22. It's pointless to sell covered calls (@ $30) now cause the premium is so little. I'm still new to this and at a loss on what to do with this until Jan 21. My prediction is $19-20 for Jan 21, then 25-30 for Jan 28th, then sit at 30-34 for most of feb.

GME: with no one talking about meme stocks anymore, this will undoubtedly fall under $100. 


AMC: See GME.  I expect this one to fall under $15. 


WISH: let's face it, in an era where flexing money on social media is all the rage, discount brands are in a really bad spot.  I could see this one falling under $2.


SDC: Goldman is massively shorting this and making sure it falls under $2, so under $2 is basically guaranteed.  In addition, SDC is in massive debt, so I expect it to fall under $1.50. 


HOOD: Robinhood lost the respect of the retail trader community when they screwed over WSB last year.  This one's falling under $10.  


ARKK:  Let's face it, Cathie Wood's no Warren Buffet.  In fact, she's a moron who just happened to get into momentum trading before retail trading really blew up; pretty much just a glorified Gary Vee.  I expect this one to fall below $75.",2022-01-06 10:56:58
1200,Best stocks to buy for my kid,"My wife and I recently had our first child and my family has given us money to invest for her ($1500). I've already opened up a custodial account with etrade and am waiting for the money to become available. The idea is to hold onto the account until a big life event happens (or at least as long as possible); buy first property, get engaged, etc.

I've been doing some research and it seems all the ""OMG YOU HAVE TO BUY THESE STOCKS FOR YOUR KID!!!!"" are toy companies or fast food, which I'm not so keen on. I do think DIS would be a good choice, but I'm not sure what beyond that. I personally have:

AAPL, AMC, AMD, AXP, GME, HD, LOW, MSFT, NIO, and TSLA.

The thought of mirroring my purchases has occurred to me, but I'm not sure if that's the best move I could make.

Any advice would be appreciated!",2022-01-06 16:06:14
1201,Has the season started early this year. Both AMC and GME soared in the after hours and other so called “meme stocks” also gained a little momentum. It would be interesting to see how tomorrow goes to get the sense of things but things are surely spicing up.,,2022-01-06 17:25:24
1202,GameStop's Crypto And NFT Plans,"Shares of GameStop (NYSE: GME) jumped 22.68% in after-hours trading due to a report that said the company is building a hub for nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and will establish partnerships with cryptocurrency organizations.

Details: GameStop has hired over 20 people for its new business where users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs, as well as video game goods, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Definition: An NFT is a unique digital asset owned by a user and stored on a blockchain. In the past year, NFTs have become a more popular digital asset for traders.

Big Picture: GameStop’s plan into NFTs and crypto is part of the company’s strategy to turn around its business, which has been struggling.

Meme Fame: After last year’s short squeeze, GameStop emerged as one of the top meme stocks. Shares are up 624% in the past year.

Final Thoughts: Thursday’s announcement seems to have a ripple effect that also helped the other meme stocks. For example, shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) went up 7% in after-hours trading.

1204,"Morning Update for Friday, 1/7/22","Good morning everyone, hope you have a nice Friday. Take it easy this weekend, try to get away from the screens. 

*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* BABA: Potential support level at 130, will be watching for more upside if it holds up. Relevant resistance levels at 135 and 140. 
* JD: Potential support level at 68, with potential resistance at \~70.
* GME: Will be watching 150 and 148 as potential support levels. Significant resistance at 160, room for more upside if it breaks through. 
* NVAX: Will be watching for upside if it can hold over 122 support. Potential resistance levels at 125 and 130. 
* NTES: Potential resistance at 100. 
* TTD: Potential support/resistance level at 80, will see what things look like closer to open. 
* AMC: Potential resistance level at 24. 

Gapping DOWN:

* KSS: Potential resistance level at \~47, will watch for shorting opportunities if it can't get back over resistance. 
* SBUX: Potential resistance level at 110. Potential support at 108, will watch for shorting opportunities on a breakdown. 
* V: Potential resistance at 217. Will watch for shorting opportunities if it rejects resistance. Next resistance at 220 if it's able to break through.
* NVO: Potential support level at 100. 
* DWAC: Potential support level at \~55. Saw some movement yesterday, will be keeping an eye on it today. 

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* ABSI: Potential resistance level around \~10. I'd like to see it find support above 9, won't be too interested in trading if it breaks down and cannot recover. 
* HGSH: I'll be watching to see if it can find support above 2.50, won't be too interested in trading if it breaks down. 
* MRIN: Will be watching 4 as a potential support level, won't be too interested if it breaks down. 
* BPT: Daily chart appears to be setting up nicely, but I'll want to see volume increase. Potential resistance level at 5. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open after we had another choppy session yesterday. After a wonderful year for the market in 2021, things are looking a bit uncertain for 2022. The Federal Reserve could raise rates as soon as March, and it will be interesting to see how the market reacts. Some analysts believe this is already priced in, while others think companies with lofty valuations are still in for some corrections. Tech stocks could see continued weakness in this environment, after the nice period of strength.

S&P and Dow Futures are down \~10 basis points, while Nasdaq Futures are down \~20 basis points. Gold and silver are trading flat this morning after they each saw some choppiness in yesterday's trading. Crude oil is up a bit as well, currently trading right around that $80 level. Meme stocks saw a spike in after-hours trading, and they'll be worth keeping an eye on today. GME should see a high-volume trading day. Energy stocks are set to continue their recent strength, and are still worth monitoring into next week. Chinese stocks are up in premarket trading and will look to continue the momentum after a strong day yesterday. Airlines and cruise stocks saw some choppiness yesterday, they could test resistance levels in today's trading. The crypto market is seeing more weakness this morning. Bitcoin is currently trading around 41,500. We could be in for some more choppiness, I'll be watching around 41,000 as potential support. Crypto-related stocks are down in premarket trading as a result. 

Remember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2022-01-07 09:21:18

I decided to look into AMCX since its ratios seemed very good.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**  
AMC Networks gets most of its revenue from cable networks. It is however focusing on expanding its targeted streaming segments which can be their competitive advantage compared to Netflix and Amazon. They've grown their streaming subscribers by rougly 150% in the period of Q2 2020 - Q4 2021. Assuming they grow their total streaming subscribers from (an estimated) 8.5 million as of Q4 2021 to 17.5 million in 2025 and, in this time period, earnings from cable networks decline by 5% per year, they would have total earnings in 2025 of $410 million. Given a 10x earnings multiple and a required rate of return of 17.5% per year, the fair value is $44.9 per share vs the current price of $42.2.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Business overview**  
Because AMC Networks doesn't disclose these numbers I could only make rough estimates. I did still feel like it was important to do so, to get a better understanding of where their revenue comes from.

&#x200B;

* Cable networks: 50% of revenue

Their major source of revenue (and earnings) is cable networks, mostly spread around North America. These include AMC, IFC, WE tv and Sundance TV. AMC had 84 million subscribers in the US as of December 31st 2020.

&#x200B;

* Original content: 20% of revenue

This segment goes hand in hand with both other segments that AMC Networks operates in. AMC Networks has created some major hits such as Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead franchise. Currently shows such as Better Call Saul and Kevin Can F\*\*k Himself are some of the big names. This content is available through their cable networks and streaming services, as well as through other parties who own licenses.

&#x200B;

* Streaming services: 15% of revenue

Streaming services account for roughly 15% of revenue. Their goal for the end of 2021 was to hit 9 million subscribers and in their latest 10Q, published on November 5th, they mentioned being 'on track' to hitting that goal. 

&#x200B;

* Others (mostly international): 15% of revenue

This mainly includes the previously mentioned segments being marketed internationally. Again, because of the way they report their financials it's hard to tell how much revenue is made per segment, but this leftover 15% of revenue can pretty much be distributed to the previously named segments.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Strategy**

In their strategy there are three main focus points:

&#x200B;

* Focusing on targeted streaming segments

AMC Networks has made it very clear that they don't try to compete with say Netflix or Amazon Prime, who are focused on the broad streaming market. AMC Networks simply does not have the resources to battle these parties. Since streaming has become so popular during the pandemic, they believe that customers will look for more specific segments of streaming, rather than a service like Netflix who does not have a specific focus. AMC Networks own streaming services that are targeted at specific segments such as British mystery, Horror and content dedicated to Black audiences. Their recent acquisition of Sentai Holdings, who also owns anime streaming service HIDIVE, is a great addition to this strategy. Albeit a relatively small one, with the company having an estimated revenue of $20 million.

&#x200B;

* Streaming as a bigger portion of revenue

With their focus on streaming segments also comes the goal of making streaming services a bigger portion of their revenue. As mentioned before, they said to be on track to hit 9 million subscribers by the end of 2021. They have also said that their goal (and expectation) is to hit 20 - 25 million subscribers on all streaming services combined. Again, finding exact numbers is hard, but in their Q2 2020 earnings call they mentioned 'being very comfortable' in that they would hit 3.5 - 4 million streaming subscribers by the end of 2020. Assuming they grew streaming subscribers by roughly 100% or 4 - 5 million subscribers in that time period, the goal to have 20 - 25 million streaming subsribers by 2025 seems reasonable. It is important to remember that the pandemic accelerated this growth and will possibly slow down as time goes on. However, on their Q3 2021 earnings call they did mention having a lower churn rate than competitors such as Netflix.

&#x200B;

* Producing more IP/original content and keeping this content exclusive

AMC Networks has mentioned having a lot of original content in the making, stating that ""2022 will be the biggest year for content in the Company's history"". Additionally, they mentioned in their 2021 10K that they want to keep the rights to this content more so than in the post. They also said that they will not extent certain licensing deals with other parties, thus making the content more exclusive to their own platforms.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **Fair value**

Before going into this I want to mention that I'm a complete novice at investing and, especially in the case of coming up with a fair value, I want to repeat that this is just my thesis, which probably contains a lot of errors.

&#x200B;

If AMC Networks manages to reach 17.5 million subscribers on all streaming services combined by 2025 (which would be short of their goal of 20 - 25 million) and realizes a 9% net margin, this would roughly equate to ( 17 500 000 x $55 x 9% =) $86 million in earnings. If we expect earnings from their cable networks of roughly $420 million to decline by 5% a year it would equate to $324 million by 2025. This would make for total earnings of $410 million. Considering they have a substantial amount of long-term debt ($2.9 billion) I decided to apply a 10x earnings multiple and a required rate of return of 17.5%, which I believe to be pretty conservative. This would equate to a current fair value of $44.9 per share for a return of 17.5% per year. It's currently trading at $42.2 per share after it has recently gone up almost 30%.

&#x200B;

I'm looking to open a small position in this stock and add more if the stock price declines. As mentioned they have unfortunately seen a big rise in stock price whilst I was researching the stock, but it wouldn't be a bad thing either to wait it out for a bit and read their 2021 10K before opening a big position.

&#x200B;

I enjoyed the proces of researching a stock a lot and hope that you can give me some feedback! Thanks a lot",2022-01-15 06:10:05

1213,AMC CEO UNLOADS SHARES; BUT THAT’S NOT ALWAYS A BEARISH SIGNAL — RULE 10B5-1," 

#### Key points:

* AMC CEO Adam Aron sells 312,000 shares, amongst other executive selling
* Investors shouldn't necessarily worry as the stock sale was a part of Rule 10b5-1
* The rule facilitates a predetermined time and sale amount, hence shouldn't be treated as a bearish signal

Yesterday, stock in AMC (NYSE: AMC) closed with a pullback of 9%; following news that the company CEO, Adam Aron, sold a large number of his personal shares – a total of 312,500 at a price of $22.85. In the past, and throughout publicly traded companies, insider selling is generally seen as a bearish signal.

However, many investors fail to scrutinize the relevant details of insider selling; in particular, Rule 10b5-1 – a trading plan that facilitates certain selling with pre-arranged circumstances; not relevant to company performance or non-public information. 

Yesterday’s SEC filing sparked a wider sell-off than necessary, and it appears bears are still active, with AMC stock down a further 1.5% in Friday’s premarket trading. The company’s CEO isn’t the first insider to start selling, in fact, numerous executives have made similar sales previously following AMC’s rising valuation over the last 52 weeks. 

So what is the rule? Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 was passed in 2000 by the SEC to reduce accusations of insider trading, and it provides CEOs or other executives at public companies a pre-approved method of selling stock they own – without the sale illustrating some sort of shortcoming within the company. The rule sets up a predetermined amount of shares at an arranged time – meaning there can be no tangible link to changes or news within the company. 

AMC saw a dramatic rise as retail traders pushed the stock up despite hedgefund sentiment arguing the opposite. The use of Rule 10b5-1 should restore some faith in the market, with Adam Aron specifically tweeting the use of the rule to reassure investors that the sale was prearranged, and not a bearish move. ",2022-01-16 04:52:08
1214,Personal thoughts on what it means to be diversified,"This is for anyone who hears ""You should be diversified"", but not exactly sure what that really means.

Diversification - WHY?  
We diversify not because we want to pick the best companies. We diversify because we know things won't always go right. In fact many bets will go wrong, so worst case happens, how can I protect myself? I'll put it this way, you are **giving up your** 300% potential portfolio return for 2022 to **avoid potential 60%** loss in 2022. The reasoning to do this is simple. It's great if I can get that 300%, we can dream about all the things we can do. Can you really afford a more than half of all you saved up? If you can afford the risk, then shoot the moon. If you can't then protect yourself.   
This is very important. Professional manager spend just as much time researching on how to avoid catastrophes than researching the next big winner.   


What is diversification:   
The ideal diversification starts at ASSET CLASS which means getting some bonds and other assets that doesn't move the in the same direction as stocks in general. If you don't care about anything other than stocks, that's OK! We'll look at only with in equity space. 

I see postings like ""I am holding NFLX AMZN FB AMC NVDA GOOG AAPL TSLA PYPL"". That's NOT diversification. These are just a list of Tech stocks. The concept of Correlation comes in here, and what it means is does it gain and lose at the same time as everything else? if I have 2 stocks that will gain and lose at the same for the same amount, there is no reason to own both. So we want correlation to be **LOW** when comparing. Below is a simple example of correlation between the stocks and S&P Tech ETF and S&P ETF: XLK is the highest against all other sectors (I didn't show here), and generally higher than SPY as a whole. So this means on a given day, your gain/loss is really determined by 1 sector - TECH. 

Ticker	XLK	SPY  
NFLX	 0.47 	 0.35   
AMZN	 0.68 	 0.62   
FB	 0.68 	 0.65   
AMC	 0.07 	 0.09   
NVDA	 0.59 	 0.44   
GOOG	 0.71 	 0.71   
AAPL	 0.84 	 0.64   
TSLA	 0.49 	 0.43   
PYPL	 0.60 	 0.59 

If you want to be diversified, you have to look for stocks that are low in correlation or negative in correlation. 

Diversification IDEAS:

* One way to gain diversification is through ETFs because you can go international (most of us have no access to international desks, so funds and ETFs are the only way to get that exposure). Diversification among countries (US/CA,EURO, Asia, South America,AU) and markets (EM vs DM)
* If you want to stay with just stocks you can own then look to SECTORS. 
   * You can pick 1 stock from each sector and buy the same dollar amount. This way you are exposed to different industries
* If you want to go even further on the Sectors, you can incorporate ""Weights""
   * Not all industry are weighted the same, so show that difference in what you're adding:
   * Since our benchmark is S&P500, let's use that weights for each sectors
   * Within selections, you want to pick the ""best"" rather than the biggest, so now you add something like P/E to make your decision on which ""one"" you buy and you buy 11 of them...or 22 or 33. 

All said and done: sample is something like this  
LH - HEALTH - $130  
MPC - EN - $30  
CAG - ConsStaple - $60  
PNW - Util - $20  
COF - FI - $110  
LYB - Material - $30  
WY - RE - $30  
VIAC - Comm - $110  
EBAY - ConsDescr - $130  
HPE - Tech - $290  
NLSN - Ind - $80  
Total - - $1000  


*important note: This is NOT what I own, and this is not my process. I simply took the stock that has a lower P/E than their industry average. It's just an example of picking A stock from each IndustrySector.*",2022-01-16 15:01:57
1215,[D] Sentiment Analysis on wallstreetbets,"Hey everyone,

I made code to automate some sentiment analysis on last weekend’s main thread. Essentially it gives ratings on stocks based on people's opinions in the comments.


Using 21k comments, I filtered based on if they contained a stock ticker listed on any of the NYSE, Nasdaq, or TSX and if they appeared in more than 2 comments. Here are the results. The 'compound' is the score, with 1 meaning really positive feelings and -1 meaning really negative feelings. Also, don't be a dick, I realize there are bugs and this is just a very early version I've made. Ideas on any other stats you'd like to see are very welcome

1217,Advice - feeling stuck,"Hello reddit,

After getting into the market during the crash I bought alot of good blue chip canadian companies at the low and made some gains. After selling them almost a year later because I fell in the trap of the GME and AMC hype (didn’t take profits at all) I am now a big negative on my portfolio.

Looking now almost 2 years post the pandemic my original portfolio would have 2x… what I am trying to say is since I don’t see those stocks dropping to that low again what should I do? Is it to late to slowly get into the dividend stocks (such as TD, Enbridge, Suncor) and just buy every time i get paid? 

Its not the worse situation but I just feel sick and stuck

Advice would be great!

And what do you guys think about Ford stock? It seems that they have alot of catalyst coming due to their new electric F150 (being the cheapest in the market for an EV truck) whats their price target do you see it hitting $100 by 2025?",2022-01-17 22:37:22
1218,AMC is a $10 stock. Tell me why it's worth more?,,2022-01-18 07:04:42
1219,Meme stocks are shorts,"Here's the real, non-echo chamber take from someone who actually knows what they're talking about. So many echo chamber-deluded apes spit out all of these qualitative factors to claim that these meme stocks are a buy, e.g. ""NFTS!"" or ""they restructured their leases!"" or ""they have a lot of cash now so they're not going bankrupt!"" This is nonsense - a company doesn't have to go bankrupt for you to lose a massive amount of money.

**Intrinsic Value: about $5 per share:** A company's intrinsic value is the present value of its future cash flows. While the market valuation of a public company can gyrate wildly around this intrinsic value in the short term, history shows us that companies' share prices will always ultimately return to this true fair price. The problem with this ""present value of future cash flows"" calculation is it's too theoretical and subjective to be meaningful, and putting forth projections here would leave me susceptible to all kinds of uneducated retorts. However, earnings multiples are a useful shorthand tool for rough valuation analysis when used in the context of other public companies' similar metrics. 

Let's say hypothetically that AMC stock drops about 50%, to $10 per share. This would give AMC a market cap of about $5B, which would put its enterprise value at roughly $14B. Wall street believes that AMC will generate about $435M (consensus) of EBITDA next year. This means that at this hypothetical $10 per share, or $14B of enterprise value, AMC would be trading at 32 times next year's EBITDA. Turns out, that is exactly the same EV/EBITDA multiple that Enphase (ENPH) currently trades at - and Enphase is a phenomenal business with solid IP, a wide moat, market share leadership, and phenomenal earnings power in a super high-growth, underpenetrated market (resi/commercial solar) - all of which are extremely attractive investment features (none of which are encompassed by AMC). I promise you, even at $10 per share (32X EBITDA), AMC would still be far overvalued. AMC's closest publicly traded peer, Cineplex, trades at about 8x 2022 EBITDA (imperfect, I know). 

In reality, AMC is probably worth closer to $5 per share. I say this because just prior to COVID hitting, AMC was hanging out in the $7ish range, and it's a reasonably conservative to assume that the equity is worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID. Why do I say it's worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID? Because I'm assuming the massive shift towards at-home streaming (see NFLX, Disney+, etc. subscriber growth surge) permanently impaired AMC's future attendance by 25% (probably conservative). The $2.5B permanent impairment charge they took against goodwill and intangibles in 2020 provides support for this assumption: that impairment chargewas about 25% of their pre-impairment total asset balance. This is the company secretly admitting the future of their business is 25% more bleak than it was before COVID.

It's totally fine to be an ape and buy the stock in solidarity with your ape brethren and because you believe there will be a short squeeze, but don't fool yourself into believing you hold the stock based on fundamentals.

On the topic of that short squeeze - it's not gonna happen, and there is no mass hedgie conspiracy against the apes. I work as an investment analyst at a long/short equity hedge fund and I promise you that the short interest you see on yahoo finance is in fact pretty close to the real number. I have confirmed with multiple major wall street brokers (think Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc.) that there are plenty of shares available to borrow, and the interest rate is about what i would expect for a stock with roughly 20% short interest.

Another way to think about the viability of a conspiracy theory like this is to think about what would motivate the alleged conspirers to engage in this type of scheme. In the hedge fund world, everyone is motivated by getting a fat year-end bonus. As an industry, we get paid our year-end bonus when the fund as a whole outperforms its benchmark (for example, benchmark might be the S&P 500). Typically the bonus payment is 20% of excess return... e.g. if if my fund had $1B of assets under management, and we returned 30% last year vs. the S&P's 20% return, our bonus payment would be (30%-20%) x $1B x our 20% take = $20m of bonus pool to be split amongst the investment professionals, back office people, etc. $1B of assets at a single-portfolio manager hedge fund can easily be handled by 5 to 10 total staff, so you can see how the economics on a per-person basis can be quite motivating.

Now, this is a double edged sword, and this is where AMC/GME come into play. There is something called a high water mark. If a hedge fund underperforms their benchmark, they would not get a bonus payment for the year, and they will never get another bonus payment until they recoup that underperformance (and tack on additional outperformance). If it seems hopeless for a fund to ever make up that shortfall, the fund will usually shut down - brain drain is inevitable at this point, as talented investment professionals will jump to another fund where the possibility of a fat bonus is on the table. Now, imagine what being short AMC last year and not exiting prior to year end would do to a fund - the stock rose roughly 13x from beginning to end of the year. Even if that was a hypothetical small 3% of the portfolio, that 3% position losing 1300% would create about a ~40% loss for the fund as a whole. That fund would shut down, guaranteed (e.g. Melvin capital) - no one sticks around at a fund that's down that much - the likelihood of ever getting a year-end bonus again is too slim. The majority of people I know at other funds who were shorting the stock for fundamental reasons prior to the WSB meme stock movement got out long before the big price spike in May - prior to that surge, the stock was already up roughly 5x from the beginning of the year, which is far too large of a loss to stomach for a hedge fund already.

**TLDR:** AMC is ""fundamentally"" worth <$5 per share, and no squeeze is coming.",2022-01-18 16:05:55
1220,Meme Stock AMC Gives Up Past Gains,"Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) fell 8.41% on Tuesday, erasing all the gains that the popular meme stock made last spring.

Catalyst: One potential reason for AMC’s recent downfall is CEO Adam Aron selling another $7 million in shares last week. That’s $40 million in shares that Aron sold in the last three months. Aron says that he is done selling shares for now.

Bigger Picture: AMC wasn’t the only meme stock to drop on Tuesday, as shares of GameStop (NYSE: GME) fell 6.6% as well.

Trending: The hashtag #AMCSqueeze trended on Twitter yesterday as people pleaded for investors to stay long in the hopes that there would be another short squeeze.

Final Thoughts: It is possible that AMC will continue to tumble. However, some investors might think another run is possible and decide to buy the dip.

1222,DCRD warrants – I believe this serial SPAC sponsor will announce a deal soon - DD #7,"**SOME KNOW THE HORSE THEY’RE BETTING ON WELL BEFORE THE RACE IS RUN**

Most horse trainers will go their entire career without ever having one of their horses run in the Kentucky Derby. Win or lose, just having the opportunity & the experience to compete in the most famous race on earth would be a dream come true for most trainers.  If you’re not a fan of thoroughbred horse racing, you probably don’t know who Todd Pletcher is, but if you are a fan of the sport, there’s no chance you don’t.  Pletcher’s entered horses in 18 straight Kentucky Derbies since 2004.[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn1) Given the preposterously low odds of a given horse making it to Churchill Downs for the biggest race on the planet, how is such a streak possible? It’s possible because Pletcher is well-trusted in this niche world, has attained prior success, and the owners of some of the best horses thus seek him out.

Before the Derby is run each year, Pletcher already has multiple impressive candidates to choose from.  I believe the Decarbonization Plus Acquisition team is similar in the SPAC world. History demonstrates they always have a host of impressive ESG entities to choose from for each SPAC. I do not believe anything is ever left to chance, and I do not believe they approach an IPO without knowing the “horse” they intend to run.  I contend that some Investment Banking teams on Wall Street specifically seek the Decarb team out for their clients, and while most of the literally hundreds of other SPAC teams file an IPO & then start the arduous process of searching for a target from scratch on Day 1, **I believe the Decarb guys already have a very good idea precisely who they’ll target from the moment they close an IPO, and that DCRD will likely announce a target soon.** That probably sounds like a rather bold claim, so I will do my best to explain it in this DD effort by tying together various bits of data gathered from numerous SEC filings & other pieces of evidence, which are now publicly available information.

&#x200B;

**WOW, THESE GUYS SURE WORK FAST.**  **EVERY SINGLE TIME.**

Before the recent froth & craziness in the SPAC market the average time for a SPAC to find a target was well over a year. But that dropped significantly during the 2020 – 2021 heyday to roughly 5 - 7 months depending upon specifically when you start & stop your analysis. Still, all three of Decarb’s prior SPACs crushed even that historically low figure, finding all their targets between 2.66 months & 3.58 months (SEE: Figure 1), an absolutely blistering pace from IPO to Definitive Agreement (DA).

**Figure #1 – The three previous Decarbonization Plus Acquisition targets**

^((sourced from SEC 8K and 425 filings))

Others have made the connection that this team works quickly, and some are long DCRD warrants for this sole reason, but for me that reason alone is not enough. Past performance does not necessarily predict future results, and while I admit the above speediness is clearly a significant positive (especially for warrant holders), by itself it is no guarantee their fourth Decarb SPAC (DCRD) will find a target as rapidly as their first three SPACs did, especially in this SPAC market downturn. The reason I am so optimistic is due to my belief that this team already has a target, and likely has since the IPO. In the next section I’ll review the three prior Decarbonization Plus deal timelines to demonstrate why I believe this is the case. I’ll do so in the chronological order of de-SPAC, as I think that’s important (more on that later), which is HYZN, SLDP, DCFC.

**HYZON MOTORS – DCRB IPO 10/22/20, Letter Of Intent (LOI) 01/08/21, =** 77 days

The IPO for DCRB closed on October 22, 2020 [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn1) a Friday, and this is the SPAC which would soon become Hyzon Motors (HYZN). Just a week later, on October 30, 2020 (***a*** ***Saturday***), representatives from Goldman Sachs (GS) video conferenced with members of Decarb’s board as well as with the CEO to discuss a potential transaction with Hyzon Motors.[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn2) Again, this is on a Saturday, so clearly GS had been in talks with the Decarb team earlier in the week, literally mere hours after the IPO!  Only three days later, on November 2, 2020, a non-disclosure agreement is signed between Decarb & Hyzon, Decarb is granted access to HYZN’s electronic data room, and DCRB retains legal counsel to discuss a deal.[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn3) The rest is history. It turns out Hyzon was previously dealing with GS for investment banking purposes, and GS (if you believe this story), delivered HYZN into Decarb’s lap immediately after the DCRB IPO closed. How convenient. Keep in mind, by late October 2020, there were more than 200 other SPACs already vigorously searching for targets[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn4), and GS could have contacted any one of many dozens of other SPACs at any time prior.  And perhaps they did, but we do know they contacted Decarb immediately post IPO.

**SOLID POWER – DCRC IPO 03/26/21, Letter Of Intent (LOI) 04/13/21, = 18 days**

The IPO for DCRC closed on **March 26**, 2021[\[6\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn5) a Friday, and this is the SPAC which would soon become Solid Power (SLDP). **The very next business day**, on **March 29**th, representatives from Stifel Financial (SF) video conference with members of Decarb’s board as well as with the CEO to discuss a potential transaction with Solid Power.[\[7\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn6) Sound familiar? The very next day, **March 30**th, Solid Power granted access to its electronic data room for DD purposes.[\[8\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn7) But it gets better, as it turns out, Solid Power had actually signed an NDA with Riverstone Investment Group back in late 2020. If you’re not aware, Riverstone IG is an affiliate of the Decarbonization team, so they were literally deep into a potential Solid Power transaction for **over** **3 months prior to the DCRC IPO**,[\[9\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn8) such that they already had an NDA agreement in place. By late March of 2021, there were nearly 400 SPACs actively searching for targets. Stifel could have contacted any one of literally hundreds of other SPACs instead, at any time prior.  Perhaps they did, but we do know they contacted Decarb immediately post IPO. **DCRC had its target the next business day post IPO**, and officially signed an LOI in a mere 18 days.

&#x200B;

**TRITIUM CHARGING – DCRN IPO 02/08/21, Letter Of Intent (LOI) 03/05/21, = 25 days**

The IPO for DCRB closed on February 8, 2021[\[10\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn9), a Monday, and this is the SPAC which would soon become Tritium Charging (DCFC).  In December 2020, the chairman of Decarb’s board met with Credit Suisse (CS) & executives from Tritium about a merger[\[11\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn10). The sleuths among you will instantly recognize that **December 2020 is in no way a date which comes after February 2021.** So how is this possible? It's possible because while Decarb was deep in negotiations with Hyzon via DCRB, it was also talking with Tritium via DCRB. Gotta’ have multiple horses to run all those Triple Crown IPO races!  Decarb actually delivered a non-binding indication of interest to Tritium on February 4, 2021, a full **four days** **BEFORE** **the DCRN IPO**, replete with a complete preliminary valuation for Tritium, and $275 million in PIPE Financing \[12\] Yes, that's right, the Tritium Charging valuation was actually completed before the DCRN IPO.  Then, on February 8, 2021, **literally just a few hours after the DCRN IPO closed**, Decarb, CS, and Tritium executives all met via video conference to discuss taking Tritium public via a SPAC.  I might add, their SEC filing is very careful to specifically note the video conference only took place, *“Following the closing of the DCRN IPO”,* lest anyone might get the idea it occurred before \[13\] The next day, February 9, 2021, **one day post IPO, DCRN was granted access to Tritium’s electronic data room**. In late December 2020, there were \~200 SPACs actively searching for targets. Credit Suisse could have contacted any one of dozens of other SPACs instead and likely did, but we do know, they contacted Decarb even before this IPO, and ultimately stuck with Decarb.

&#x200B;

**MORE TIME’S PASSED SINCE THE DCRD IPO THAN ANY PREVIOUS DECARB SPAC TOOK TO FIND A DA**

And (in Martha Stewart voice) that’s a good thing. In every previous SPAC in Decarbonization’s portfolio, they had an ESG target picked out virtually simultaneous to, or very soon after the IPO closed, and a DA within about 4 months or less. As of this writing, it’s been 5.1 months since the DCRD IPO, so although 5.1 months would historically be an extremely quick time to DA in the SPAC world, it’s already a month longer than it’s ever taken Decarb to produce a DA. So why is that? Well, the bear case would be that due to market conditions, perhaps they lost their target. This is certainly a possibility given the SPAC market downturn, but even this wouldn’t bother me as this team has a large stable of horses to take public. Reading through the SLDP, HYZN, and DCFC SEC filings, it is made clear that the Decarb team had multiple attractive targets to recently choose from, and if they “lost” one, my suspicion is the delay would only be a few months as they go with a backup. The bull case, and the one I think quite likely, is they were waiting until DCFC successfully navigated the de-SPAC process & went public before dropping the next DA.  Although the Decarbonization team has a wealth of prior SPAC experience dating back years, this was the first time they ever undertook an international SPAC (Tritium is an Australian company), and the reality is it's well-known in the SPAC community that international SPAC deals come with significant additional complications than domestic SPAC deals & the red-tape, layered regulations, international tax policies, etcetera, routinely take longer to move from LOI to DA to de-SPAC trading.  But this process is now complete as DCFC began trading just 5 days ago.

**IF THE GREATEST RISK TO DCRD WARRANTS IS LIKELY ALREADY “REMOVED”, WHAT RISK REMAINS?**

By far, the greatest risk to holding any SPAC warrant is that the SPAC fails to find a target, liquidates the trust, returns $10 + interest pro rata to shareholders, and leaves the warrant holders with bupkis; but if you’ve read this far you’re probably already well aware of that fact. This is why it’s crucial to understand that **the executives of the team at the reigns of DCRD have taken exactly 6 SPACs public to date, and they have closed on targets with, and successfully taken public all 6 of those prior SPACs.**[\[14\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn1) I do not expect DCRD, to go any differently, as this team was doing SPACs many years before SPACs were hip & literally **this team has never failed to acquire a target.** If that is the correct thesis, then by far the greatest risk to a DCRD warrant investment is removed.  So what risk remains? In my belief, the greatest current risk is the general malaise in the overall SPAC market.  But while inflation may not be transitory, market conditions usually are. The SPAC market, like all markets, goes through ups & downs, and we’re currently in a down cycle. That down cycle I speculate is making it more difficult for SPAC sponsors to nail down targets, as companies likely fear they may experience a high level of redemptions which might deplete part of the financial projection they were counting on from the SPAC. That is not a trivial thing. But conversely, we’ve also recently seen a reasonably valued SPAC deal close with almost no redemptions. That deal? This Decarbonization team’s DA with Solid Power (SLDP). Nevertheless, warrant prices have been punished so severely recently, I personally believe there are attractive entry points in many of the top sponsor’s warrants. The warrants of the myriad other sponsors without either a significant track record of past success taking companies public via SPAC, or those which do not have a well-known and respected M&A professional or team at the helm? Personally, I’d avoid them right now due to risk of deal incompletion, but YOMV.

&#x200B;

**WHAT KING OF HORSE ARE WE BUYING HERE, THOROUGHBRED, CLYDESDALE, APPALOOSA, ARABIAN, MORGAN, OLD MARE?**

As the Decarbonization names implies, they focus on ESG names which have a beneficial impact on Climate Change & Global Warming, specifically mentioning, as the name overtly implies, *""decarbonization""*. Some possibilities I've thought of: Carbon capture, CO2 Direct air capture, Energy storage, EV, Hydrogen power, Lithium battery manufacturing, Lithium brine mining, Recycling, Solar power, Spodumene mining, Water sustainability, Wind power. Personally, I ‘d love to see a target having something to do with lithium as I believe it has a bright and long runway ahead.  That said, EV tech does tend to deliver big stock gains.

&#x200B;

**WHAT SORT OF RETURN CAN I REASONABLY EXPECT HERE, WE TALKIN’ LAMBO OR TREK?**

While it’s difficult to predict the future, especially without knowing the target, we do know that warrants tend to rip higher once they have a DA, greatly due to the aforementioned risk of failing to find a target being removed, but also sometimes due to finding an excellent target.  And again, while past results do not guarantee future results, every one of the Decarb team’s recent warrant investments turned out to be extremely lucrative. In fact, **the “worst” of their three prior SPAC warrants had an all-time low post-DA price of 99¢** (SEE: Figure #2), which is well-above DCRD’s current 82.8¢, representing an attractive worst-case 20% gain (SEE: Figure #3) if a DCRD target's found & the warrant valuation curve stays relatively within the bounds of prior results.  I think this is a fairly safe bet. Conversely, the best performer was SLPD warrants, which nearly touched $7 per warrant, good for a  massive > 740% gain from where DCRD warrants are currently priced. But if it just gets to $1.25 sometime after the DA, which is a rather modest return especially for an ESG target, that’s over a 50% return from where DCRD currently trades. Hell, the DCRD warrant high price during better SPAC times was $1.40 even without a target, simply due to, IMO, the strength of this sponsor’s reputation & prior results. So with a decent target it certainly wouldn’t shock me if DCRD warrants trade to $1.40 or higher again.

**I’VE GOT A FEVER; AND THE ONLY PRESCRIPTION IS MORE HOPIUM.**  **CAN YOU HELP ME?**

Every publicly traded company has a CIK number[\[15\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn1). It stands for Central Index Key, which is completely useless information you should probably forget 38 seconds from now. When you search EDGAR, you’re actually searching by CIK number even though you probably don’t know it.  For instance, when you search for “Clover” or “Microvast”, the system has a numeric tied to each of those names, but those names are only recognized because someone at the SEC has manually entered that company name after the CIK number is previously generated (contrary to popular belief, MVST’s CIK number is not in Chinese characters). The egg (number) came first, not the chicken (company name). This is why you’ve perhaps noticed that after a SPAC begins trading under the new de-SPAC ticker symbol, you may still have to search by the old SPAC ticker, because the (probably) lazy government employee hasn’t gotten around to the manual entry of the new company name yet. For the SPAC teams that I keep a close eye on, I look for newly generated CIK numbers, because they must generate that number with the SEC before they can register any filings, including those for a new SPAC IPO. I noticed that the CIK number for **the draft registration of Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation V was generated back in early September**.[\[16\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn2) This entity will eventually become DCRE when the future IPO closes. Given my knowledge of how fast the Decarb team works, that definitely caught my attention, but a draft registration can simply be a placeholder, and it can sit idle for months. In other words, it’s not a smoking gun.  However, about a month later the S-1 for IPO hit EDGAR.[\[17\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn3) Again, interesting as it’s one big step closer to another Decarb IPO, but at that time they still had two companies, SLDP and DCFC to navigate through NASDAQ listing, but nevertheless I was further intrigued. But here’s where it gets interesting; **on December 27th, 2021, just 22 days ago, Decarb filed an amendment to the S-1**[\[18\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn4). The specific change in the IPO S-1 amendment increased the future DCRE NAV kicker by 5¢, which makes me strongly suspect this IPO’s going to drop in the next few weeks. Why? Because why would you make that change now if you weren’t going to IPO for several more months. It’s a change specifically predicated by current market conditions as SPAC IPOs have typically been juicing the trust to increase surety that arbitrage hedge funds will line up for a plate of units. You likely don’t make that very specific monetary change unless you know you’re close to listing the IPO. And what else did the Decarb team file with the SEC on that same day, December 27th? A 425 entry reminding voters to please vote for the upcoming Tritium merger.[\[19\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn5) In fact, just 6 days prior to that the 424B3 for Tritium was completed.[\[20\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/submit#_edn6) That filing is a bear of an undertaking & signals the bulk of the SPAC’s work is essentially over. Given as I’ve demonstrated in this piece that the Decarb team has always had a target for DA somewhat soon after an IPO (or even before), I believe the DCRE S-1 amendment to IPO filing happening right around the same time this serial sponsor’s work on DCFC was completed, likely signals that the Decarb team already has a target for DCRD. So as this section of my post says, “Hopium” for sure, but it is well-educated, investigational Pepe Silvia hopium nonetheless, and based on real-world IB procedure/process & what I believe are logical business timelines.

**CONCLUSION / DISCLOSURE:**

I am long 100,000 DCRD warrants on my belief the SPAC will announce a target fairly soon for all the reasons I’ve covered above, on my belief that the target will be something in the very hot ESG field / climate change field, and on my belief that opportunity will exist to sell these warrants significantly higher at some point post-DA, just as there was with HYZN, SLDP, and DCFC.  I realize this piece was very pedantic & wonky, so if you made it this far I appreciate it.

Q1 of 2021 the EPS barely made it in the positive mark and the Revenue missed by over 5%.

1225,"Devastated and depressed, any advice?","So my portfolio is down from 1.2m to 350k this year. I was devastated and have been depressed for quite some time now. I make a humble income and this portfolio is most of my networth, so this has been incredibly difficult for me. 

That being said, I would like some advice from here. Some may think I trade high-risk options with that kind of money. Actually not really, my holdings include Nio, Tesla, Eyes, Joby, Sofi, Aht, Btx, Mp, Cpe, Arkg, Arkk, Spce, Dkng, Fubo, Amc, Clov, Rlx, etc. I used 10-20% margin at some point that looked like buying opportunities which I shouldn’t have of course. 

Most of the time I just buy and hold (I didn’t even buy at the highest price). When stocks keep going down, I buy more. I don’t know how it happened but many of these stocks have gone down 70%+?? I don’t have any cash now and my portfolio is down 70%. I even sold some covered calls to hedge. 

What’s incredibly scary is that many experts keep saying a crash/recession coming soon. I don’t know what I’m supposed to think or do. Cutting losses now??? My stocks have crashed so hard already except Tesla, Mp, Cpe. I really don’t know what a crash means for those ultra growth stocks which have gone down 80% already?..and it’s been very difficult for me to cut losses at this deep (and I don’t know if there’s still a point in doing so)

Luckily I’m no longer on margin and I didn’t invest all my savings. So I’m not desperately in need of the 350k right now and can wait maybe 3-5 years. But what to do now? should I sell everything or keep my holdings or revise my portfolio? I can’t really afford to lose the money in the long run. And all this in the past year has been hurting my mental health. Anyone has any advice?

EDIT: thanks guys for all the advice. I feel better and calmer now about the situation. I know I was gambling and was not looking for sympathy. Thank you for everyone who’s concerned. 

The reason I picked those stocks was that I followed some popular financial analysts bloggers and joined their discords. They recommended some of these stocks and think my holdings are relatively safe and suggested me to hold whenever I was attempted to sell (they say some of these are to be held for 3-5 years like Sofi, Joby, Nio). I followed their advice because I reached 1.2m from low six figures in 2020 using margin buying SPACs and penny stocks I found online (risky behavior paid off…) I sold most of them and got into the stocks I mentioned above. I also had INTC, QQQ, Netflix, AMD, NVDA, CCL, JWN, Microsoft, etc, however, I sold them at some point to average down the “bad stocks.” Apparently, I didn’t anticipate things could go this wrong. 

Anyway, that’s my story and lesson. Don’t fully trust those “experts” who’re so sure about some small-cap opportunity…

Edit 2: lots of folks are saying about I should have sold stocks and changed my portfolio at 1.2m. I was considering it but the taxes I would have to pay for selling those winners deterred me (like half of my gains come on, but if I wait it out till a year, it would save me a lot)…and then March hit and then May hit and then things went to hell…

Edit 3: Since many asked, I started small in 2018 and only deposit a lot more into my account around august 2020 I think? The portfolio was worth 250k then. Yea what a crazy year…THANK YOU again for all the great suggestions.

Edit 4: peeps keep saying why I didn’t realize the stocks I were holding were high risks. I DID. I only said I didn’t buy “high-risk options” (I didn’t buy any options at all). And I thought only AMC and clove are meme/wsb stocks?? Correct me if I’m wrong. I was hoping for a quick gain and then failed to cut losses.",2022-01-22 02:20:10

1227,$28k between two kids,"My kids grandmother passed and left all her insurance split between the grand kids.  My two girls, ages 8 and 10, will get $13,XXX each.  I have a custodial brokerage account that we started for each of them last year and they have only about $2000 each in there account.

my original plan would be to put $10k each into the ETF and then sprinkle the other $3k around on individual stocks with a dividend or good long term grown potential.  the money will be their when they turn 21 so there's not a lot of time for it to grow so some riskier plays would be ok with a smaller percentage of the money.

1230,"My first year trading and my amateur insight , NFA","I got into stocks after the GME and AMC craze. Unfortunately I jumped on that train, of buying hype stocks and penny stocks and it didn’t make  much, in fact I probably lost a few hundred. So I started to do some research and although boring , it is the blue stocks and dividends , then when bought consistently for many years , will have a nice bit of coin waiting for you when you take in out in a decade or two. I don’t have time to day trade, nor do I have the knowledge , so I buy 90% blue chips with dividends and reinvest, and even after only about 8 months of doing that, I’ve seen some nice returns.  

What I’ve learned :

Don’t FOMO , rarely does buying a penny stock because it’s shot up to 28% make you money, especially if you buy it ATH, you’ll more than likely be disappointed , because you missed the ride and it will probably end up costing money, unless you want to hold onto a cheap stock for possible years.

Sell at a loss , sometimes. I was really into penny stocks at first, because if those 2000 shares I bought went from 19 cents to 4.00 I’d be well off. Unfortunately this rarely happens and picking the correct stock largely comes down too luck(especially if you do minimal research’s. The stock crashed to about a 20% loss and just stayed there for months , it wasn’t an insane portion of my portfolio and the money was not giving me any return. This is when I got wise. I sold it , took the loss and stated looking for less exciting but better options on how to make money. 

I took a look at what the great investors do , and aside from the huge amounts of money they have, it’s largely very boring but in the long term, incredibly effective for generating money over a decade or two, especially for blue collar investors like myself. You buy the same couple stocks with dividends over and over and over again, for years. Drip the dividend. 

My current strategy I hope to use until I’m a few years past retirement

Portfolio consists of 90% blue chip dividend stocks and 10% ventures and riskier stocks, then when they (hopefully ) go up I sell and reinvest in either my blue chips or buy some more riskyish stocks. I consistently buy 4 different stocks every month and yeah it’s boring but again, already seeing how over 20 years, money won’t be too much of an issue.

TFSA 

If you’re like me and couldn’t afford any meaning nodules contributions to TFSAs until a couple years ago , you’ll have a lot of room to add stocks to one without going over the limit(mine was almost 80k when I first started). The only drawback being is stocks are not eligible for capital losses in a TFSA , so pick wisely.

In conclusion, if you are a long term, middle class person and want to make money, don’t FOMO and focus the vast majority of your investments on blue chips and drop your damn dividend .

Forgive me if I rambled , I hope this was helpful.

1232,How to find best priced LEAPS?,"I am predominately a long-term investor and use fundamental analysis to find companies that are trading at a significant discount to their FCF and which, I believe, have a lot of growth potential but which are trading at a fair price. I have been using the Wheels Option strategy to acquire stocks at a cheaper price through cash-secured puts and then sell them once I believe they are selling for a premium using a covered call. 

Lately, I have been interested in incorporating LEAPS. My main question is what are some key insights for finding the best-priced leaps with the highest amount of probability and profit potential? 

For example, if I were to want to buy LEAPS in FB or BABA just as some examples.

Should I buy the deepest ITM stock price that I find? Should I look for the lowest implied volatility? I have heard that we should stick to delta that is anywhere from 75 to 100 for LEAPS? Should I stick to stocks that have been trading sideways (low volatility?) (going down and selling long Call LEAPS?

Would this process be similar for selling Put Leaps? Say I believe a particular stock market is overvalued and I want to profit from the decline in the stock price instead of outright shorting shares. For example, I think with the rise in interest rates and continuous rise in inflation some stocks or at least some sectors will be greatly hit i.e., tech, retail, and companies with bad financial statements (AMC).",2022-02-05 01:43:06

from my understanding, if the price goes to 27 or above on or till 25 of Februrary, I have the right to turn those 22 call options into 22 x 100 stock, where each stock instead of $27 would then only cost me $0.42 (<-- not sure here, since it's so little), which would make it a total cost of $924  instead of $59,400? that sounds insane to me, but I guess my price calculation could be right, because in the end its a bet, right and I could lose it all?

GME FEB 18, $150 CALL (3 pc) | 3.30 DAY

here, if the price goes to 150 or above on or till 18 of Februrary, I have the right to turn those 3 call options into 3 x 100 stock, where each stock instead of $150 would then only cost me $3.30, which would make it a total cost of $990  instead of $45,000

1240,"[TA] AMC is aiming for 32$ (Cup & Handle, 1H)","&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/avUz5zBq\/](https://preview.redd.it/04rxraxtodi81.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d78cbaac770071ec367141400314c6737f94f35c)

&#x200B;

We're looking at the 1 hour chart for the AMC stock price and things look quite good after the recent drop in the whole stock market.The previous downtrend was very intense and got extended by fear about inflation & the planned interest rate hikes throughout 2022. We saw the market bottoming out about 3 weeks ago. While the whole market is retracing, we see different patterns emerging among the many stocks we can trade. The AMC stock price is currently printing a Cup & Handle on the intraday chart.

We could've spotted the trendchange for the stock price with a ""change of market structure"", a very basic but powerful pattern (covered that in one of my videos extensively). The price is moving from lower highs to lower lows within a downtrend. As soon as we see a change of structure, the price will aim for higher highs and higher lows. The circumstance is underlined by a rounding bottom, which forms the cup.What we want to see is decreasing volume during the downtrend & increasing volume during the uptrend. This translates to the sellers being exhausted and the buyers being back in control.

The price is sitting right below a key level at 20$, which has been relevant for the past 5 years. We saw many support/resistance flips at this price level and the chances for breaking this level within the current upwards trend are pretty high. This price is the break-out level we're looking for.

During the past trading-days, we can observe the price being rejected at the 20$ mark multiple times. Still, buyers manage to push the price further in this direction - which increases the probability for the breakout. I'm also expecting this price level to be an important support during 2022.

When we're looking for a target projection for the Cup & Handle pattern, we measure the decrease in price from the breakout level to the bottom of the Cup (53.18%). We use the same size to project a target from the breakout level, which brings us to 32$. Coincidentally this price is also our previous high from December 2021 and the starting point for the downfall. We can expect some sell pressure there (traders breaking even or taking profit).

I'm expecting the price to aggressively move towards the 32$ level within the next 3 weeks. Those 3 weeks are leading to the earnings, which are expected to be better than the forecast. I don't think that this is priced in yet and especially short-term traders will join the train for short-term gains. This additional momentum, combined with the option market/ shorts being liquidated, will fuel the upcoming breakout.

Looking forward to it! I'll keep you guys updated.

# Company Description

Groupon operates an online marketplace for deals on local goods, services, travel, and attractions. Revenue is driven by commissions from sellers, with 60% of gross sales coming from North America. The company also has substantial holdings in equity investments, with their SumUp (fintech) assets estimated at approx $500m alone (current GRPN mkt cap \~$640m). The company brought on the former Zappos CEO as a permanent CEO in 4Q21, replacing the interim CEO.

# Thesis

GRPN shares are severely undervalued, especially when accounting for equity investments in Sum-Up (valued at approx $18/GRPN). Ex-investments, GRPN's operating business is currently valued at a Fwd P/E 1.55, Fwd PEG of 0.038, and Fwd P/S of 0.12; in its entirety (inc. investments), GRPN is valued at Fwd P/E 10.9, Fwd PEG 0.267, and Fwd P/S of 0.68, still insanely good. For comparison, Peabody Energy (ticker BTU, a US coal company) currently trades at a Fwd P/E of 6.36 and Fwd P/S of 0.54. Fundamentally, this company screens extremely well.

Like many companies, GRPN initiated a strategy shift and cost restructuring starting in 2020 (with related impairments occurring through 4Q21) that is finally nearing an inflection point for their business rebound. Despite impairments ending in 2021, the company is expected to continue realizing an additional $225m in cost savings in 2022. Coincidentally, this is also occurring as covid restrictions are easing. Both the restructuring and the ""post-covid normalization"" are intersecting at the perfect moment to supercharge the company's profitability as Americans return to activities outside the home and merchants return to the platform.

Additionally, they revised their accounting methods in 2020 to better account for their goods strategy which has been a drag on revenue comps in 2021, but will normalize in 2022 as it laps quarters since the change was implemented.

In Q3, the company also entered new partnerships with Google Pay and Square for distribution of inventory, a major win in increasing their audience that will help drive increasing volume.

The company just brought on a new CEO, Kedar Deshpande (former CEO of Zappos), and it's possible that he resets financials. However, I'd assign a low probability to this given that financials have already been reset over the restructuring period.

It's also worth noting that GRPN has a strong record of surpassing analyst estimates over the covid period, and as long as analysts stay cautiously optimistic, they're likely set up to continue leaping over the low bar. Given how depressed estimates are, this may allow them to overcome a key risk that earnings may be volatile following the Omicron surge in Dec-Jan in the US, though this may be neutralized by guidance commentary as the surge is a month behind us and there is likely more clarity on the road ahead.

There is also a high short interest on GRPN stock (\~19% of float) that has lazily remained in the stock as a short momentum play. Given this type of inflection point for the underlying business combined with the current market environment leading HFs to crowd into shorts, a strong rally on GRPN fundamentals from here would likely lead to an acceleration of short covering, driving the stock closer to fair value in a relatively short amount of time.

Tldr: GRPN severely undervalued, has a ton of hidden value from investments, and is at a key inflection point exiting a restructuring at the same time that demand should flow back to the platform. Sentiment is still cautious enough to create a phenomenal entry point, while short interest is extremely high, creating a potential short cover as lazy momentum shorts unwind.

# Current Valuation & Financials

Fwd P/S ’22: 0.67

Revenue Growth Est: 0% '22, 7% '23

* Revenue is expected to stabilize in 2022, though I suspect this is a great setup for continued upside surprises, boosted by the Things to Do and Beauty Goods verticals that are leveraged to easing covid restrictions.

Fwd P/E 10.9

EPS Growth Est: +41% '22

* EPS expected to inflect higher as cost restructuring gains take hold and revenue stabilizes & accelerates as the world reopens post-covid and merchants return to the platform.

Fwd EV/EBITDA: 3.05

EBITDA Growth Est: 27% '22, 13% '23

* Strong EBITDA growth a direct result of cost restructuring and continued cost improvements. GRPN has used the pandemic crisis to shift strategies and drastically improve efficiency of operations and profitability.

Free Cash Flow Generation: +140% YoY '22

* FCF is expected to turn positive in '22 for the first time since 2019. GRPN currently trades at a 12% Fwd FCF Yield, very high for a growth stock inflecting to reaccelerate revenues. 4Q21 FCF is expected to grow at 290% YoY, with 1Q22 expected to be the first decisively positive FCF Q1 ever.

Equity Investments

* Equity investments are the 1000lb elephant in the room. The latest earnings report revalued LT investments at $123m on the balance sheet, though in Jan 2022, it was reported that SumUp (of which GRPN own's 2.4%) was preparing to raise an funding round at a $22bil valuation. If successful at this valuation, their equity position in Sumup would equate to approx 528m, increasing their investments by over 4x. In turn, their balance sheet equity would actually equate to a higher total value than their current market cap.

Analyst Price Target: $37, +67.6% upside

* Analysts have gone stale, with 60% of PTs updated prior to 2022. By leaving GRPN in the cold on updates to institutional investors, this has created opportunities once the company reports on Feb 28 for models to be revised higher and sell-side sentiment to suddenly become more optimistic given the current inflection point.
   * Barclays stated valuation is currently ""rock bottom"" and expects the marketing strategy to generate growth near term, though is waiting for confirmation of continued momentum before upgrading the stock from underweight.
   * JPMorgan is also cautiously optimistic that the 2020-21 restructuring efforts are about to pay off through higher growth and a more profitable business.
   * A recent report by Prescience Point Capital Mgmt established a longer-term fair value range of $69-100+ when accounting for the operating business and investments.

# How to Play

All positions provide the highest aggregate returns at the lowest strike price in their tenor. Returns presented as profit (i.e. 2x = 200% profit, 300% original cost). Recent highs of $31 on 2/1/22; 2H21 high of $45.

* Stock! No brainer. Big returns to be had for the swing trade.
* Quasi-Risk Averse: Jul '22 C22. On a run to 35, these return 2x; continued momentum above 40 returns at least 3x.
* Pump It Up!: Apr '22 C25. Offers profit of 1.8x-7.5x on a run to $30 or a break toward $40.
* WSB Delight: Mar '22 C25. Offers profit of 3x-7x on run to $30 or a break toward $35.",2022-02-24 15:05:47

1244,Great news!!! SEC proposes new rule requiring short-sellers to disclose their positions monthly,"Gary Gensler has been circling short-sellers for months, and now the Securities and Exchange Commission chief is looking to make a big move. Under a new rule proposed by the SEC Friday morning, some investors would be required to report their short sale-related activity to the SEC on a monthly basis, allowing the commission to make detailed short-selling data available to the public for the first time.

“Today, the Commission unanimously voted to propose rules and amendments to broaden the scope of short sale-related data available to the investing public and to regulators,” Gensler said in a statement. “If adopted, it would strengthen transparency of an important area of our markets that would benefit from greater visibility and oversight.”

Since taking the reins at SEC, Gensler has made market transparency a key goal, and short-selling has been a major area of discussion, including after the wild short squeeze that took hold in January 2021 on meme stocks like GameStop GME, -5.80% and AMC Entertainment AMC, -3.90%. The fallout from the short squeeze resulted in a Congressional hearing and an SEC investigation. While the probe did not find any actual malfeasance, Gensler has been hinting that he still was monitoring short-sellers. In February, Bloomberg News reported on a sweeping Department of Justice probe of at least 30 short-selling firms and allies.

Retail investors have complained that more shares are being shorted than are available to trade, while keeping alive online discussions claiming market manipulation, potential fraud by short-sellers and the lack of data publicly available around short-seller trading activity. Under current rules, firms are required to report short interest data to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority twice a month. Critics have said the quality and frequency of that data isn’t highly useful. The SEC’s proposed new rule will look to bridge that gap.

While the changes to previously proposed SEC rules have been common, as written Rule 13f-2, would only apply to institutional investment managers that hold “a short position of at least $10 million or the equivalent of 2.5 percent or more of the total shares outstanding” in an individual security, meaning that the SEC would be able to see and share the biggest short sales of individual stocks and aggregate them, providing investors with granular data on those shorts. Firms also would have two weeks into every month to disclose, giving essentially a detailed 6-week lookback at big short moves and give a much clearer, if month-old, picture of short interest on stocks.

The rule, as designed, would increase disclosure of what is known as “buy-to-cover,” essentially when a trader initiates a buy trade to close their short position on borrowed shares, something that short-selling critics likely will welcome as it would aim to further curb so-called “naked shorting,” a practice the SEC mostly outlawed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis for traders using non-existent shares to short stock of public companies. Overall, the new transparency rule is yet another push by Gensler to bring more market data out of the dark corners and into the light.

As he told MarketWatch in an exclusive interview last week, “Finance is ultimately about trust, and the official sector has a role to help instill that trust through a set of rules on disclosure, anti-fraud and anti-manipulation.”

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 28th, 2022.

# **With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
> Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.
*****
> “Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
> Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.
*****
> “I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”
*****
> # Market reversal
> The S&P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.
*****
> “Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”
*****
> Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.
*****
> “The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”
*****
> Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.
*****
> “In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.
*****
> # Fed rate hikes
> Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.
*****
> “We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”
*****
> Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.
*****
> “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.
*****
> However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.
*****
> “It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.
*****
> Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.
*****
> He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.
*****
> # Jobs, jobs, jobs
> In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.
*****
> Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.
*****
> “We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.
*****
> # Boiling oil
> Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.
*****
> “That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.
*****
> # Bullish bet?
> Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.
*****
> But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.
*****
> “We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.
*****
> Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.
*****
> The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.
*****
> The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.
*****
> Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.
*****
> “It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&P futures.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/feb25bd4cdbe0ffd38abe3b85d7ef57c/ec436ef0b8793cc1-b0/s500x750/1a889a3555ac7f2bd39bd75e8f97cd37e16a7d3c.jpg))**

> In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.

> It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.

> However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.

> Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.

> # Stocks Move Into A Correction

> For the first time since March 2020, the S&P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?

> “Let’s remember the S&P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png))**

> What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-2.png))**

> With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.

> # March Almanac: Stronger in Midterm Years

> As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 & 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.

> Normally a solid performing market month, March improves in midterm-election years. In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best. DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been up for five of the last six midterm Marchs.

> # 11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine

> Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”

> Here we list 11 things you need to know.
> * While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
> * Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> * Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.
> * Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

> * We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.
> * As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

> * Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.
> * European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.
> * There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.
> * Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**

> * From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.

> This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.

> # What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?

> Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.

> “The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”

> The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

> As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.

> Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

> The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

> After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",2022-02-26 08:02:23
1246,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 28th, 2022","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 28th, 2022.

# **With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
> Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.
*****
> “Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
> Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.
*****
> “I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”
*****
> # Market reversal
> The S&P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.
*****
> “Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”
*****
> Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.
*****
> “The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”
*****
> Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.
*****
> “In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.
*****
> # Fed rate hikes
> Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.
*****
> “We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”
*****
> Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.
*****
> “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.
*****
> However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.
*****
> “It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.
*****
> Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.
*****
> He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.
*****
> # Jobs, jobs, jobs
> In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.
*****
> Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.
*****
> “We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.
*****
> # Boiling oil
> Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.
*****
> “That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.
*****
> # Bullish bet?
> Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.
*****
> But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.
*****
> “We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.
*****
> Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.
*****
> The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.
*****
> The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.
*****
> Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.
*****
> “It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&P futures.

> # Cold War 2.0 – Midterm Bottom Nears

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/feb25bd4cdbe0ffd38abe3b85d7ef57c/ec436ef0b8793cc1-b0/s500x750/1a889a3555ac7f2bd39bd75e8f97cd37e16a7d3c.jpg))**

> In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.

> It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.

> However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.

> Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.

> # Stocks Move Into A Correction

> For the first time since March 2020, the S&P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?

> “Let’s remember the S&P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png))**

> What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-2.png))**

> With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.

> As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 & 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.

> Normally a solid performing market month, March improves in midterm-election years. In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best. DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been up for five of the last six midterm Marchs.

> # 11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine

> Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”

> Here we list 11 things you need to know.
> * While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
> * Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> * Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.
> * Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

> * We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.
> * As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

> * Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.
> * European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.
> * There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.
> * Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**

> * From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.

> This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.

> # What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?

> Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.

> “The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”

> The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

> As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.

> Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

> The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

> After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",2022-02-26 08:48:28
1247,"Options expected moves this week. SPY, TSLA, CRM, ZM and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** closed higher in a volatile week by about 0.5%, inside the 2.4% options were pricing. However, it was lower by almost 5% mid-week before a rally into Friday.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 2.2% move this week (about $10 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** – The VIX closed last week just above 27, similar to where it started the week, but was 37 mid-week. As mentioned the past few weeks, traders should be aware of the implied volatility backdrop as it has been changing fairly significantly day to day (and even intra-day).

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.2%** (about $10)
* QQQ **2.8%** (about $10)
* IWM **2.9%** (about $6)
* DIA **2%** (about $7)

### In the News

Tesla (TSLA) stock’s breakout in the Fall of ’21 took it from under $800 to over $1200 in the span of a few weeks. After a late year pullback to under $900 it made another run to $1200 to start 2022. During the market lows of last week it traded as low as $700 before finishing the week back above $800. In other words, it’s been volatile. Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves. Looking ahead, options are pricing about a $45 move in either direction for this week and about a $105 move for the month of March, even though the stock has seen those types of moves in a single day recently.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/sbvkum525gk81.gif

Out of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls.

Bottom line, Tesla options have been underpricing most of the stock’s moves since last Fall and and continue to price moves of only about $100 month to month. Options implied volatility doesn’t always reflect realized volatility because market makers don’t want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops. But in this case TSLA stock has been moving wildly since its big breakout and hasn’t stopped making large percentage moves, both higher and lower, since.

1248,More Wash Sale Confusion....,"New trader here, I got in last year with the meme stock trades and although I was up quite a bit in June I find myself upside down AF right now with a huge tax bill on the way. But that's really besides the point. 

What I'm really trying to do is figure out how to make the best of a bad situation. So I'll try to keep this brief.

Basically I took losses last year but bought back in before 30 days so I have wash sales on several lots of share. 

One of those lots was a large purchase I bought of AMC @ 20. The stock has been trading up and I'm getting to the point where I need my money. Can someone please explain to me how this wash sale sitting on my trade price works. For reference, with the wash sale my adjusted price is just about doubled, so average price on those shares is 39. 

At what point would that wash sale become a tax benefit? Above 39? or above 20? Or is it just tax recording??? Is there any real reason for me not to sell at 20 and get my cash?

I'm so fucking confused right now and I need to buy a car people!!! 

Any help is appreciated and if you want to tear me a new \* please feel free.

Thanks",2022-02-28 14:18:36

1250,Spider-Man Saves AMC,"Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) fell 0.05% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the movie theater chain posted what it calls its “strongest quarterly results in two full years.”

Financials: AMC posted a loss of 11 cents per share and revenue of $1.17 billion; both were better than expected.

Yes, a Way Home: Revenue and movie theatre attendance shot up in the quarter, thanks in large part to the movie Spider-Man: No Way Home, which was the third-highest grossing movie of all time.

Accomplishments: Chairman and CEO Adam Aron touted AMC’s new non-fungible token (NFT) programs, its acceptance of cryptocurrency, and its entry into the retail popcorn industry.

Final Thoughts: Despite Aron’s bullish outlook for 2022, there are still concerns. The company is still not profitable and the stock is down 58% in the past 6 months.

I think this is a great sign to get into a trade, when Retail gets destroyed. I bet there were signals during GME or DWAC or AMC or any of the meme stocks.

Does anyone know of a data source for Retail traffic or any approximation of it other than word of mouth?

Or is that literally the PFOF that Citadel was paying Robinhood and other discount brokers for and if I wanted it, it would cost the same amount?

Maybe a Twitter scraper of some sort?",2022-03-08 23:57:33

1258,"Bloomberg: ""AMC teams up with Eric Sprott on mining investment (really)""","AMC Entertainment Holdings Corp., which got swept up in last year's meme stock rally, is teaming up with one of Canada's best known mining experts on an investment.

AMC announced Tuesday morning that it's joining with Eric Sprott on investments in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. Each of them will plow US$27.9 million into Hycroft in exchange for a 21.8 per cent stake in the miner.

""To state the obvious, one would not normally think that a movie theatre company’s core competency includes gold or silver mining,"" said AMC CEO Adam Aron in the release.

He went on to state that AMC's ""demonstrated expertise"" in navigating liquidity challenges will be beneficial to Hycroft, as the miner seeks to develop a 71,000-acre mine in Nevada.

The investments will see AMC and Sprott acquire 23,408,240 units in Hycroft, with each unit consisting of a common share and a warrant to purchase another common share for US$1.068. Hycroft shares closed at US$1.39 on the Nasdaq Monday.

After peaking at US$62.55 last May, AMC shares lost 78 per cent of their value through the close of trading Monday.

1259,Reddit is eyeing a $15 billion IPO. Here’s how it became the giant cultural force it is today.,"[https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-15-billion-ipo-cultural-force/](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-15-billion-ipo-cultural-force/)

Reddit is many things: the people’s forum, a repository of the dankest memes, the not-so-secret weapon against Wall Street, and “the front page of the internet”. It might also soon be known as a publicly traded company valued at [$15 billion](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/reddit-files-us-ipo-2021-12-16/). The famed social media platform plans to take itself public sometime this year (possibly as soon as [this month](https://www.barrons.com/articles/reddit-initial-public-offering-ipo-news-51639645252)). Reddit has already filed preliminary IPO registration statements with the SEC and has [engaged Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/reddit-is-said-to-tap-morgan-stanley-goldman-sachs-for-ipo?sref=qMIA4tzu) to guide it. 

This potential IPO represents a big moment for a company that has undeniably earned itself a prominent place in the internet zeitgeist. Internet dwellers have long turned to Reddit’s online communities for loosely moderated bonding over shared passions ranging from [tripping acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/) to [admiring the CCP](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZedong/). Over years of playing host to strange worlds of bronies and NSFW video enthusiasts, the platform has contributed much slang to the [pop culture lexicon](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-wallstreetbets-glossary-a-field-guide-to-apes-stonks-tendies-AMC-GME-reddit/)*.* But the platform really showed its reach in 2021, when posters on r/WallStreetBets [orchestrated a short squeeze](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-vs-wall-street-by-the-numbers-one-year-later-wallstreetbets-gamestop-amc-cloverhealth-tesla-blackberry/) of multiple stocks including GameStop and AMC. Until Reddit goes public, the term ""Reddit stock"" refers to securities hyped by retail investors on the platform. The successful effort to stick it to institutional investors sent shockwaves through Wall Street and may have inspired a [DOJ inquiry](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-big-short-seller-probe-who-are-the-investors-on-the-dojs-list/) into a number of prominent short sellers. 

A company with a big role in internet history, Reddit has quite a history of its own. Its story embodies the spirit of Web2 entrepreneurship, with its college-nerd beginnings, minor trickery, and a corporate acquisition that left its founders feeling short-changed. ",2022-03-15 15:26:30
1260,Can We Talk About How Greasy This Whole AMC Deal Is? It's Comical,"Alright, retard, all opinions on memestocks and AMC squeeze shenanigans out the window for this post and comment section.🤝

We will focus on this AMC gold miner deformed dumpster baby that literally gets sketchier the deeper you really look.

But first, how greasy is this deal? [Greasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7FsAgPuVwU)

Let us dive in:

1st: Let me take this layup real quick, movie theatre executives don't know dick on how to fucking mine for natural precious metals. Coincidentally, this is about as close as a YOLO a corporate executive/board can go.

2nd: HYMC coincidentally drops an ATM stock offering this morning of up to 500 million unloading on apes as the stocks price launches. For those who don't understand, they are essentially able to soak up this 500% share price increase in taking a shitload of cash while massively diluting their shares. Isn't it odd that this was left out of the AMC press release and not spoken about at all on MSM today? Personally, I read an article in Barrons and NYT that completely failed to even mention it once. Side note: in a total dipshit move that makes Cramer look normal aaron [canceled](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1503763167473713155?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) his appearance on CNBC with a dumbass reply, what a fucking dweeb. Everyone knows in the era of Elon Musk, laws and court orders don't matter on Twitter and TV.

3rd: Goldminers largest shareholder is Mudrick Capital \~40% of stock outstanding. For you true autists, this is the same Mudrick Capital who bought 8.1 million shares of AMC stock in a closed offering and then sold the very same day. Wow, ain't that fucking weird. 

4th: The movements of this stock before this announcement are fucking sketch as hell. Take a look at 2.50 strike [call](https://imgur.com/a/62YCIqU) open interest. So you telling me that some entity just decided to yolo massive amounts of money on massive OTM calls days till expiry on some shit profitless mining company right before a fucking movie theatre buys a massive stake? Call me sherlock holmes cause that's suspicious. 

\-Granted, most of the volume for these options came in Friday at prices between .15 and .60 and the options barely got above .30. Nonetheless, sketch as hell. But the general movements of the stock before the announcement is undeniable.

4.5: This one isn't of any substance but I think it's worth something. This fucker took a picture with a sign in the middle of the desert as a showing of quality, no gold production or busty facilities. This is essentially if Elon Musk came out to woo his retarded investors with a new car model and instead of showing an actual car he shows a drawing.

Like fuck me, put me in charge of Wendys and I'll invest in Diane Fosseys Gorilla fund so apes can break free from behind the dumpster and frolic free in the wild while simultaneously solving climate change by making biofuel from their shit. No need to call me a hero.",2022-03-15 22:16:18

Since the OG meme stocks are pretty predictably volatile, could it be a good strategy to buy at-the-money or just out of the money calls and put, with a strike price a few months out.   Price of the underlying goes up, sell the calls and make money, price goes down, sell the puts and make money.

What do you more experienced think?

1263,Can anyone help me find a break pad part?,"I want to get new break pads for an AMC 1970 Javelin.  All the searching on eBay brings me to upgrade kits, but I literally just want new break pads.  Does anyone know where to source a part that works?  Doesn't need to be old stock, even a newer equivalent piece would function fine.  Thanks!!",2022-03-20 18:43:28
1264,Future of $BB?,"So I’m aware of the fact that $BB was caught in the whole WSB hype alongside GME and AMC. It was the only one of these 3 I invested in because I was under the impression that their QNX softwares were going to be used in many many cars manufactured in China and potentially later in the US. I heard that there were many quarter earnings with losses but that gains were going to be seen in the future. We’re almost a year removed from the actual WSB hype of $BB, and I’m just curious, now that all the smoke has settled, what are the realistic expectations for the stock (not the actual company itself even though I know there’s somewhat of a correlation)? Is it just going to hover around the $7-12 price point per share for a long time or is there possibly something in BB’s future that may trigger some more growth in the price?",2022-03-23 03:19:08
1265,Meme Stocks Are Back,"Retail investors doubled down on meme stocks Tuesday, suggesting that the meme stock revolution of 2021 is still alive and well.

Numbers: Shares of AMC (NYSE: AMC) jumped 15.02% on Tuesday, GameStop (NYSE: GME) jumped 30.86%, Express (NYSE: EXPR) went up 9.73%, and Koss (Nasdaq: KOSS) went up 29.48%.

Background: In January 2021, a group of users on the platform Reddit teamed up to create a short squeeze against hedge fund giants that bet against stocks such as AMC and GameStop. During this time, several of these so-called meme stocks increased. But many meme stocks later decreased as investors switched to more conventional stocks.

Catalyst: The reason for yesterday's sudden surge in meme stocks isn’t clear. Both AMC and GameStop have reported questionable financial news in recent weeks (AMC bought a gold mine and GameStop had mixed earnings). Short interest is slow compared to last year’s activity. The number of times GameStop has been mentioned on the WallStreetBets subreddit jumped from 115 to 400 yesterday. Ryan Cohen, GameStop’s Chairman, bought another 100,000 shares on Tuesday.

Big Picture: One potential reason behind Tuesday’s surge is the overall risky economic environment. Stocks that are speculative in nature usually perform well in these environments.

Final Thoughts: Tuesday’s surge may have been great for the meme stocks, but without a clear catalyst, it is probably not wise for investors to keep betting on meme stocks.

1266,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 23, 202","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 23, 2022**

Stocks fell on Wednesday, giving back some of yesterday’s gain, as market participants digested new remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and contemplated the potential that the Fed will take a more aggressive than expected approach to reigning in decades-high inflation. The price of crude oil was on the rise again, with the West Texas Intermediate rising roughly 4% to $114 per barrel. 

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.29%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.36%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.36%
* Volatility Index (VIX): +2.75%
* Apple (AAPL): +0.82%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): -3.36%
* Gamestop (GME): +14.50%
* AMC: +13.58%
* ZTE (ZTCOY): +21.97%
* Gold Miners (GDX): +2.46%

US stocks have see-sawed between gains and losses this week as investors weight recent, hawkish remarks by Jerome Powell. Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics, Powell said the Central was ready to “take necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability”. This implies the Fed is ready to raise the interest rate by 0.50 basis points or more if warranted. In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm)

Last week, the Fed raised the interest rate for the first time since 2018, bringing it up by 0.25% from near-zero levels. Acknowledging that inflation will likely stay higher for longer, policymakers have revised their forecasts higher and now expect six additional hikes (not including the most recent one). Inflation (as measured by core PCE) is expected to be at 4.1% this year, up from a 2.7% projection in December. By 2023, inflation is estimated at 2.6%, up from an earlier forecast of 2.3%. 

Regarding the interest rate, Jim Read, head of credit strategy and thematic research at Deutsche Bank, said “Equities tend to continue their upwards march in the nine months after the Fed begins to tighten, as the strong economy that enabled hikes supports growth. After that, equities become more volatile and are more likely to experience a drawdown. Ten-year Treasury yields start increasing, sending their prices lower, but eventually flatten out and decline as markets put increasing probabilities on the next recession coming. History suggests we should not be worried about near-term impacts.""

In other news, market participants continue to closely monitor developments coming out of Ukraine and the global response to such developments. President Biden is set to travel to Brussell on Wednesday to convene a summit of NATO allies, a meeting that will likely see more sanctions levied against Russia. 

**Highlights**

* U.S. new home sales unexpectedly declined for a back-to-back month in February, underscoring some slowing housing activity and demand as rates moved higher and affordability became further squeezed. New home sales fell 2.0% in February compared to January, [the Commerce Department said Wednesday.](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf) This compared to an increase of 1.1% consensus economists were expecting
* An index tracking weekly mortgage applications dropped 8.1% during the week ended March 18, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said Wednesday. This came after a 1.2% decline during the prior week.
* Toyota Motor and Aurora Innovation have started testing autonomous an autonomous ride-hailing fleet in Texas, with two safety operators and no passengers on board. Toyota's Sienna minivans, retrofitted with Aurora's self-driving system, will be tested on highways and suburban streets in the Dallas-Fort-Worth area, with the operation including trips to the airport.
* Alphabet Inc's Google said on Wednesday that it would allow Spotify to use its own payment system in its Android app as part of a new pilot. Users who have downloaded Spotify from the Google Play Store will be presented with a choice to pay with either Spotify's payment system or with Google Play Billing.
* LG Energy Solution plans to build a battery factory in Arizona to supply to Tesla and other customers, two persons familiar with the matter told Reuters.
* Sales of McDonald’s ‘McPlant’ sandwich, created with Beyond Meat (BYND) are “underperforming franchise sales”, according to analysts at BTIG Research. This does not bode well for BYND stock, which is already very beaten down.
* Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc. announced it will go public in the United States by merging with blank-check firm Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV Inc. in a deal valued at roughly $1.25 billion.

""The real test is not whether you avoid failure, because you won't. It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere."" -*Barack Obama*",2022-03-23 17:23:03

1270,Penny Stocks w/ Unusual Options Activity - $HYMC $REI $TKAT $VRM $IQ $WTI $LLNW,"Been following their coverage of penny stocks with unusual options activity and think it's really good info. This was from Thursday afternoon so take it FWIW. Keeping an eye out for any more updates:

$HYMC

The options market for HYMC stock has been red hot since the AMC news, but no contracts have been hotter than the April 14th $2.50 Calls. As of today, there are more than 27,000 contracts of open interest. Meanwhile, Thursday’s volume was over 10,000 contracts.

$REI

While there is plenty of open interest and volume in the REI April 14 $4 calls, the May 20, 2022, $4 are in focus. That’s because going into the session, open interest sat at 2,255. However, the option’s volume is more than 14,000 contracts today.

$TKAT

Look at the April 14th expiration Call contracts. In this case, the $5 strikes show fewer than 1,000 contracts of open interest. Volume, however, is much high at more than 3,600 contracts.

$VRM

The used car e-commerce platform provider has come under pressure in recent weeks. But that doesn’t seem to have impacted traders taking a bullish stance on the stock. The April 14 and May 20 expiration $5 strike Call options are in focus. Respectively, their open interests sit at 62,993 and 15,142, with volume above 15,000 and 10,000 contracts so far today.

$IQ

Chinese online entertainment technology company iQIYI has recovered from its pullback this year. However, sentiment appears mixed based on the options chain. While there is much more significant volume compared to open interest in the $5 and $6 strike Calls for April 1, the $4 strike puts show much higher volume overall. Whether this translates into more bearish activity in the IQ market is to be seen but may be worth noting, all the same.

$WTI

Another energy penny stock to watch right now is W&T Offshore Inc. If you look at the options flow, you’ll see why. The $5 strike options expiring April 14 have less than 500 open contracts. Meanwhile, there were more than 14,800 contracts traded as of this article.

&#x200B;

$LLNW

Earlier this month Limelight agreed to acquire Yahoo’s Edgecast Inc., which provides edge security and content services, in a deal valuing Edgecast at roughly $300 million. Even though LLNW stock has been on a roll for months as we’ve discussed, this news has sent a strong message to the market with moves to higher highs this week. Looking into the options flow, we can also see interesting activity in the May 20 $4 (in-the-money) Call options. There were about 2,000 open interest contracts with more than 4,100 traded according to today’s volume.

# [Stock futures are flat as a big week of economic data kicks off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures were steady Monday morning as a week filled with key economic reports kicked off, and investors continue to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve’s planned interest rate hikes.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 points, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1%.
*****
> Shares of Tesla popped more than 5% in premarket trading on Monday on news it wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend to shareholders.
*****
> The Securities and Exchange Commission filing said Tesla will ask at its annual shareholders meeting “for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock ... in order to enable a stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.”
*****
> Elsewhere on Monday, parts of The Treasury yield curve inverted on Monday, raising some recession concerns. Earlier on Monday, the yield on the 5-year Treasury note rose to 2.6361%, while the 30-year yield was down less than 1 basis point to 2.6004%.
*****
> However, the main yield spread that traders watch — the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate — remained positive for now.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 rose on Friday to close out their second consecutive winning week. The Dow gained 153 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5% and has more than erased its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2% but still finished the week in the green.
*****
> The moves came as investors continue to monitor developments in Russia’s war on Ukraine and expectations about the Fed’s plans to hike interest rates.
*****
> “It seems the skyrocketing move higher with commodity prices has taken a break and that has allowed investors a chance to pile back into equities,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Geopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won’t be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned.”
*****
> Investors continue to keep a close eye on the Fed. Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America penciled in half-point hikes in future Fed meetings this year after the central bank’s chair Jerome Powell vowed to be tough on inflation and said rate increases could become more aggressive if necessary.

> On Friday, the benchmark 10-year yield touched a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% as investors priced in a more aggressive rate hike cycle, which helped lift financial stocks while tech stocks pulled back.
*****
> Investors are looking forward to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, this week. The JOLTS report is one set of employment data that the Federal Reserve is watching closely as it tightens monetary policy. ADP will also release its private payrolls data ahead of the main show, the closely watched monthly jobs report, on Friday.
*****
> Monday is a light day for earnings reports but several big companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week, including BioNTech, Micron and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

*****
> Traders are also monitoring the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war, as peace talks get under way in Turkey. To be sure, both sides have said they are not close to reaching a deal. Ahead of the negotiations, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on that “nothing is agreed upon unless everything is agreed upon.”

(Visit if feeling nostalgic:[ https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld1wio/i\_probably\_should\_have\_sold\_if\_i\_was\_a\_pussy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld1wio/i_probably_should_have_sold_if_i_was_a_pussy/)) I have since been freely living the degenerate life in and out of the market all the while looking for and waiting, very patiently waiting for the next big thing.

Now, before I go any further, I know you probably think you've heard it all. Everything is a ""squeeze"" nowadays and you immediately tune out once the term even comes up as it has completely lost its meaning to anything short of pump and dump.

I urge you to drop what you've heard the past year, put every burnt out association with the label 'short squeeze' out of your mind for just one second, and hear me out.

I hereby present to you a ticker that goes by the name of $SST, or System1.

SST (previous ticker TREB) is a de-spac which means it merged with a special purpose acquisition company (Trebia Acquisition Corp) and had the majority of its public float (51,750,000) redeemed upon merger (99% to be exact). As per their 8-K on Feb 2, 2022: ""51,046,892 shares of the 51,750,000 outstanding shares of Trebia Class A Common Stock were redeemed in connection with the Business Combination."" [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-22-025942/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-22-025942/)

You may have heard of the 'de-spac squeeze' before (which occurs due to retail latching onto the shrinkage and lack of liquidity of the float, 'squeezing' it), or maybe even specifically, IRNT, another de-spac widely publicized on here in September, which then squeezed from $8 - $47.5.

SST has a public float of just 703,108 shares, one of the smallest de-spac floats EVER just after ISPO (256,408 - squeezed from $9 to $108), ANGH (243,000 - $8 to $33.13), EFTR (521,358 - $8 to $40.42), and AGIL (567,373 - $9 to $36.13).

None of the stocks mentioned above, minus IRNT had options.

Now, allow me to introduce the gamma component.

&#x200B;

**The Gamma Squeeze**

IRNT, unlike the others mentioned above, had a post-redemption float much to the higher side, of 1,381,162. The reason IRNT was able to squeeze so high with a relatively large float (compared to its squeeze peers), is in major part due to the gamma factor.

The IRNT options chain had been loaded with thousands upon thousands of OTM calls, and as the price surged, MM's were forced to hedge for these calls, and due to the tiny float, this resulted in an insufficient amount of shares to be found for hedging, creating a snowball effect that 'squeezed' the price higher and higher by desperate MM's trying to find shares for the contracts that were sold.

At its current price of $15.02, SST has 21,202 April 14th call contracts in the money, amounting to 2,120,200 shares (or \~301% of the public float) which will need to be hedged for April 14th if the price can sustain the $15 mark. Should the price reach $17.5, that number goes up to 28,516 contracts or 2,751,600 shares, $20 - 2,938,300 shares, $22.5 - 2,989,300 shares, and $25 - 3,593,400 shares, or 511% of the publicly available float.

The focus here is on the 4/14 expiry date because up until a few days ago we did not yet have weekly options so that is where most of the OI, volume and liquidity lies.

&#x200B;

**The Short Squeeze**

Now, hopefully you understand gamma, the powerful force that shot IRNT to new highs of a preposterous 400% in just a few days. But if you don't or are not convinced, don't worry, because lo and behold, tis’ but a slice of the pie.

As of the latest official report on March 17th, which is updated bi-weekly by the NYSE/NASDAQ, SST has 2,816,545 shares short.

That gives it approximately 400.5% short interest and makes it the most shorted stock in the entire market- by a very wide margin. As of today, Mar 29th the cost to borrow is a staggering 231.33%- one of the highest on the market.

You may be wondering how a number so high could even be possible? Let me take you back to the GME days, and introduce or reintroduce to you what you might remember as the 'naked short.' Naked shorting is the action of forcibly short selling without actually finding a physical share to borrow and which now account for the vast majority of the recent short volume (see the most recent Fails to Deliver [https://fintel.io/sftd/us/sst](https://fintel.io/sftd/us/sst))

&#x200B;

**What Explains This?!**

So now you might be wondering, why? Why would hedge funds, retail or anyone for that matter, short a stock to oblivion like this should they not expect the price to go down drastically. The answer here is most likely twofold; the first being that, in the de-spac cycle, a company files an S-1 shortly after merger which deems certain shares subject to unlock, thereby adding dilution to the float, you can see the lock-up provisions for this ticker on the SEC website if you’d like. This file must be approved and made effective by the SEC, which typically has an execution time of 2 - 6 weeks. The problem for shorts here is, the SEC currently seems to be massively backlogged and there has not been a de-spac S-1 made effective in months. In the end nobody knows when the next one will occur, it could be imminent, on any given day, or in the case of MVST, another de-spac favorite, a long time, with an S-1 originally filed 6+ months ago with no effect. Now this in and of itself of course does not warrant a 400.5% short interest, the trade is far too crowded to be profitable, with all of the covering that must occur in the end. The over-leveraging here on the short side is most likely by the fault of the same MM's who have been selling options and are on the line for a lot of shares should the price increase due to hedging. They are likely trying their best to artificially drive the price down to avoid being on the hook for actually delivering the shares of your options contracts all the while pocketing that sweet juicy option premium you paid for.

&#x200B;

**The Company In And Of Itself**

Now before you jump the gun, you might be asking, what am I even investing in? Do I even care? Well I certainly don't recommend building a long term position in this company with the upcoming volatility that should take place but, this company and its underlying financials is not one to scoff at, nor do I recommend you short.

If this is something you really want to take a look at I suggest you read this brilliant DD on the fundamentals and state of growth of the business here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sjbtws/system1\_sst\_ready\_to\_pop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sjbtws/system1_sst_ready_to_pop/)

&#x200B;

**What I Expect to Happen Here:**

In reality, nobody knows what might happen here as the public float on SST is so small post-redemptions that it should not even technically be allowed to be trading with an options chain as per standard regulations, and we have never seen a setup quite like this before. The majority of the shorts in this trade entered in the low $10's range and it is rumored that they should be forcibly margin called if the price increases near the $20’s. On the other hand, call sellers may be forced to hedge as OPEX comes closer and closer, triggering a sudden price increase which will be a catalyst in itself. Whichever is triggered first, is anyone's guess but at the current rate, with the almost doubling of the short interest every bi-weekly report, MM's are trying their best to keep that price increase at bay, and it will need a strong push made by an outside force (IE retail) to make the break here. If and when this does occur though, I think it is safe to say that once the inevitable short and gamma squeeze unfold there is no way of turning back and the rest will be history.

Disclosure: My position- I hold 50 4/14 $15 calls and plan to be trading the volatility as I have been. I will enter with a larger position once this gets the retail interest it needs to be valid as it is currently quite literally being held down by short sellers. I am in this ticker strictly for the technical setup at this time and do not plan to hold this for the long term.

HYMC has made headlines again and is fighting the hedgefund shorts.

Is there growing sentiment that this is less of a pump and dump and more of a stand against hedge fund naked shorting? I find the Sprott aspect to be most interesting, he is an avid anti-short seller.

Interested to hear other peoples thoughts on this.

1280,The GOLD Hands $HYMC - Ya'll Ready For This?,"I will start with Northern Nevada -  Known for its **casino and tourism industry**, Reno is the county seat and largest city of Washoe County and sits in the High Eastern Sierra foothills, in the Truckee River valley, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada.  Nevada is the leading U.S. producer of gold, silver, and barite; the second largest producer of diatomite and lithium and the sole producer of mined **magnesite and mercury**. 

Gold mining is a major industry in Nevada. Unlike most other states in the U.S., there are still many active large gold mines. In fact, Nevada is one of the major and reliable sources of gold globally. Most of the mines in the state produce gold through **open pit mining** by using heap leaching method of recovery. Therefore, let’s explore the major gold mines found in the state of Nevada, and their primary minerals.

So Now let us look at $HYMC the Next TOP meme Stock and supported by $AMC, their CEO Adam Aron, Their Investors and their MONEY....some think the stock will reach $5.00, Others say $25 and me and the **Moonshot Believers $50 by Q4.... $HYMC or**  Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation is a gold and silver producer.  They are not even Ranked as December 2021 in the TOP 5 Mines in Northern Nevada, so WHY This MINE? - Here is what I do know -   AMC spent $27.9 million in cash for the deal and received roughly 23.4 million shares in the company.  

* **Two weeks after AMC purchased a stake in Hycroft Mining, the company has raised a total of $195 million.** 
* **Leading gold and silver investor Eric Sprott has also taken a large stake in Hycroft. -**  He is One of the world’s leading gold and silver investors, **Eric Sprott** has taken a large stake in Hycroft. Together, AMC and Sprott invested $56 million in Hycroft.   - WHY????

The Company is engaged in the operations, development and exploration activities of Hycroft Mine. The Company’s Hycroft Mine, is an open-pit heap leach operation. The Company’s Hycroft Mine is located approximately 54 miles west of Winnemucca, Nevada. The Company covers an approximately 70,671 acres of patented and unpatented claims. The Hycroft Mine is located on the western flank of the Kamma Mountains.

1282,DD on HYMC,"**Unbiased DD on HYMC**

**Mining Background:** Hycroft mine was formerly known as the CroFoot Lewis Open Pit Mine. This mine began operations in 1983. From *operational* inception in 1987 to 1998 the mine produced 1m ounces of gold and 2.5m ounces of silver. Low gold prices in the late 90’s forced the mine into “care and maintenance” programs. Then in 2007 Hycroft restarted the mine and in 2008 began operational activities. From 2008 to 2015 the mine was actively operational. Then, in 2017 the mine was again placed into “care and maintenance” when it stopped adding lime to the leach pads. Care and Maintenance activity was continued through 2018. Activities were then restarted in late 2018, early 2019, with a small crew of only “six haul trucks, two hydraulic shovels and one wheel loader”. Initial production spanned from Aug. 2019 to November 2021 when Hycroft ceased operations.

**Key Mining Takeaways:**

· Viable mine with proven resources

· Recurrent pattern of discontinued operations

· Known sources of ore from 30+years of drilling

· Like all mining operations, activity is heavily dependent on economic value/feasibility of mining the ore

**Company Background:** Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. – formerly known as Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corp. – was formed in 2017 – and owns the Hycroft Mine

**Company Arrangements:** *Sprott Credit Arrangement*\*\*:\*\* Hycroft entered into an arrangement with Sprott Private Resource lending and established a senior secured credit facility up to $110m. This agreement also prohibits HYMC from distributing dividends

**Company Ownership:** As of March 31, 2022, Mudrick Capital Management LP, (“Mudrick Capital”), 2176423 Ontario Limited, an entity affiliated with Eric Sprott (“Eric Sprott”) and American Multi-Cinema, Inc. (“AMC”) owned approximately 12.4%, 11.9% and 11.9% of our outstanding voting securities, respectively, and have the right to acquire 13,308,529, 23,408,240 and 23,408,240 additional shares of common stock, respectively, upon the exercise of warrants held by them

**Pit Information:** Open Pit mining w/ heap leach processing – fancy terminology for “using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials”. Resources are contained in oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores. **Currently Hycroft has no ongoing commercial mining operations or sustaining revenue from the care and maintenance processing operations currently conducted.** The mill and Acid POX (pressurized oxidation) process remains the focus of ongoing work, as it generates higher gold and silver recoveries than the sulfide heap oxidation and leach process.

**Resources and Expansion**: Any expansion of the Hycroft Mine necessary to exploit any additional mineral resources that may be established through Hycrofts exploration drilling program beyond the mineral resources in the 2022 Hycroft TRS, **will require Hycroft to obtain all permits, approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in Nevada. (LENGTHY PROCESS)**

o **Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources**: 9.6m ounces of gold, 446m ounces of silver

o **Inferred mineral resources**: 5m ounces of gold, 150m ounces of silver

o In the 10-k there is no mention of a *proven mineral reserve or probable mineral reserves* because there is no actual mining taking place

**Financial Information**

· Net loss of $88.6MM vs 2020 Net Loss of $136MM

· Gold Rev increased more than 2x

o Mine had more ore under leach

· Silver Rev increased more than 3x

o Mine had more ore under leach

· Company continues to process gold and silver ore on the leach pads but does not expect to generate net positive cash for the foreseeable future

o Total projected sources of future liquidity decreased by 4x from 2020 to 2021

· There are numerous debt covenants surrounding the Sprott Credit Agreement

**Final Takeaways**

Company is at least 2-3years away from a commercially viable operation and has all sorts of funky credit/debit covenants with gold investor Eric Sprott, who just so happened to purchase 12% of shares, who also receives a royalty from smelting action and who has publicly ridiculed short sellers. To the moon? I don’t know. But I’ve got 15 C 4/14exp at 4.00

1283,"Fireside talk regarding Meme stocks, Crypto and NFT on r/stocks","[For portfolio post, see here](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/t44iin/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread_march/)

  Hey stock traders & investors, we felt it was essential for us to have a small ""fireside"" talk and remind everyone of our rules regarding meme stocks, penny stocks, and crypto. 
Currently, we are receiving a lot of reports, and mod mails around ""meme"" stocks and crypto, and we want to clear the air here.
Lately, we're seeing more & more posts regarding meme stocks. We define meme stocks as a stock that has a significant following (like a cult) from a non-traditional trader; attracts considerable social media attention surrounding the stock; cult members follow mentions and brigade by sharing mass links upvote regardless of the quality; thread jacking every post and spamming the meme stock so no other stock can be discussed.

The main goal of the cult for any meme stock is to pump the price. 

 These are different from penny stocks which we class as stocks that have traded less than $5 / share over the last six months or have a market cap of less than $300m.

But penny stocks share something in common with meme stocks: The pump in price. However, they go through extreme pump & dump campaigns continually losing value making them ""cheap"" and where you encourage others to buy 100s of 1000s of shares thinking ""cheap"" is a good deal but the penny stock promoter sells their shares at the top of the pump, then repeats at a lower price convincing you to buy another round of 100s of 1000s of shares, either through group chats, spamming social media, or forums like these; it is illegal and will not be tolerated and you will face a ban.

 Crypto: We do not have any plans to allow crypto or NFT talk here that are unrelated to stocks. This subreddit is for stocks only. We will keep expanding crypto-related stocks like COIN if those discussions are related to the **quantitative**, **fundamental**, and **technical** aspects of said stock such as **price movements, cashflow, C-staff changes such as CEO replacements, earnings reports, product changes that will affect the stock price, etc**.
 
 Crypto specific or NFT specific posts will not be permitted and the mods will remove those posts. Repeat offenders will be banned.
We are aware that GME is pushing for an NFT store; GME has sales of $6B TTM so if the NFT store makes, let's say, less than 5% of the $6B sales ($300m TTM) we'll consider it crypto spam/shilling and remove it; **NFT hype for stocks is going to be considered crypto shilling.**

 Our best examples of meme stocks are AMC & GME, see the wiki below how we determined meme stocks in depth, but we all know GME is a meme and has several cults on Reddit. If you want to spam about GME then you can do that on other sub reddit, see the links and wikis below. 

 **We actually allow discussions on meme stocks.**  However, we need to ensure that we do not become simply a meme stock sub drowning in a flood of posts discussing the same exact stock every day, and to do that, we implemented some protocols we set up in 2020 when the meme stock mania took hold:

* We will limit the number of posts that are submitted to r/stocks that are around meme stocks.

* They must be high quality and based upon verifiable data.

  * News must come from a mainstream news broadcaster that focuses on stocks (for example, we will permit the Financial times, CNBC etc. but not Fox, BBC etc.).

  * Automod will remove Twitter or youtube posts. Automod will police this, and the method it decides what is low effort or not will change dynamically to deal with the volume of mentions of said meme stock.

 * We will not permit any conspiracy theories at all. There needs to be evidence and grounded.

  * While we have a criteria for meme stocks (see wiki below), the mods will have full discretion at all times. Simply posting the meme stock ticker and nothing else or similar low effort comments will be removed, and circumventing automod or another mod will result in a ban.

 * And with the help of the r/stocks community, whenever someone uses the report button to identify shilling, it helps the mod team focus their efforts on actual shilling and spam; thanks! 

 The users of r/stocks don't want to discuss the same exact stock multiple times a day, every single day, and we don't want to be shilled to.

We're desperately trying to warn the community of the manipulation that's going on here just to get you to pour your money into these types of things so that they can sell at a higher price and you're left holding the bag with no one to sell to. That's not how you build wealth in the long term with stocks. 

 See our [wiki on meme stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/meme-stocks) and our [wiki on crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/crypto-general) and please post to r/superstonk for GME fun/speculation/rumors/conspiracies and r/cryptocurrencies or r/cryptocurrency for crypto/NFTs, and see our main wiki for all the [related financial subs (or non financial subs like politics) (at the bottom).](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)


TLDR: We require meme stocks to be high effort posts + comments, and we will continue to push back against the flood of posts to ensure we don't become overtaken by meme stocks or crypto shilling.",2022-04-04 15:07:16

1286,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 8, 2022","**Psycho’s Market Recap - Friday, April 8, 2022**

US equities finished mixed Friday to close out a negative week as market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes and look forward to the March consumer price index (CPI), which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation. 

As a reminder, the previous consumer price index (CPI), which showed prices rose an average of 7.9% year-over-year, did not account for the spike in oil and other commodities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a result, expect CPI to come in even higher next week.

With the fastest pace of inflation in forty years, commentary from Federal Reserve officials remains in focus. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he wants the Fed to get to between 3% and 3.25% on the funds rate in the second half of this year, implying more aggressive, front-loaded interest rate hikes in the near-term. Bullard was the only dissenter in the Fed's March meeting, calling for a larger 50 basis point interest rate hike versus the 25 basis point hike that ultimately occurred.

While Bullard has consistently been the most hawkish member of the Fed, there are signs other officials are also warming up to the idea of a 0.50 basis point hike in the next meeting. 

Fed Governor Lael Brainard said that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was [""prepared to take stronger action,""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brainard-fed-prepared-to-take-stronger-action-on-inflation-140504789.html) should inflation readings remain elevated and warrant such moves. And in the Fed's meeting minutes released Wednesday afternoon, the central bank revealed that ""many participants ... would have preferred a 50 basis point increase"" in rates, and also suggested the Fed was gearing up to soon announce the start of its balance-sheet runoff process.

However, other members of the Fed continue to offer a more dovish approach to raising rates. [Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-bostic-evans-back-rate-193909071.html)said it would be ""appropriate"" to move the benchmark interest rate ""closer to a neutral position,"" suggesting a somewhat less hasty series of interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans suggested the Fed would be able to ""get to neutral, look around, and find that we're not necessarily that far from where we need to go.""

Kevin Nicholson, chief investment officer of global fixed income in Riverfront Investment Group, said “The market actually had to digest a lot of information — a lot of hawkish information from the Fed over the last couple of days. We had been in a sell-off mode. And I think \[Thursday\] we finally got a chance to take a breather and realize that the equity markets especially have some actual positive things that are going on. We also think that you have support with a strong labor market. ""The economy is in great shape from that perspective.""

Next week, earnings season kicks off, with JP Morgan and other big banks presenting their Q1 2022 earning reports. This will help elucidate how the economy has performed during a very tough quarter.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 8.5% in March compared to the same month last year, according to the latest report released Tuesday. The figure marks the fastest rise since December 1981 and follows a 7.9% annual increase in February. Heading into the report, consensus economists were looking for an 8.4% jump for March, according to Bloomberg data.

Excluding food and energy, so-called core CPI increased 6.5% on a 12-month basis, in line with the expectation. However, there were signs that core inflation appeared to be ebbing, as it rose just 0.3% for the month, less than the 0.5% estimate. That in turn sparked some hope that inflation overall was easing and that March might represent the peak.

Some of the biggest contributors to the latest increase in inflation were food, shelter and gasoline, according to the BLS. In fact, the index tracking gas prices surged to rise 18.3% month-on-month in March, comprising more than half of the total monthly increase in CPI. In February, gasoline had posted a 6.6% monthly increase.

Shelter prices rose 0.5% month-on-month in March and by 5.0% over last year, representing the biggest annual rise since May 1991. Airline fares also soared by 10.7% on a monthly basis and by nearly 24% over last year, as rising fuel costs and increased demand for travel pushed ticket prices still higher.

CPI prices accelerated on an annual basis for seven consecutive months now amid supply and demand constraints, especially in labor — with job openings still far outpacing new hires — and a spike in commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Many of these costs have been passed on continuously to the consumer.

With inflation at forty-year highs, members of the Federal Reserve have intensified their hawkish rhetoric, meaning a 50 basis point hike in the next meeting is almost guaranteed. Last week, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said that bringing down inflation was ""our most important task,"" while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that high inflation was ""as harmful as not having a job.""

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's March meeting minutes suggested that ""many participants ... would have preferred a 50 basis point increase"" in benchmark interest rates, with the larger-than-typical rate hike serving as an aggressive move toward raising borrowing costs and bringing down demand. The Federal Reserve is set to convene for a policy-setting meeting May 3 and 4.

1293,$RDBX: The Ultimate Penny Stock Squeeze Play,"Has anybody posted about and/or looked into $RDBX yet? The short data here is fucking insane. Ortex data as of 4/28…

1) 52% of the free float is short.
2) Average borrow cost is 320%.
3) 75% of the free float is on loan.
4) Utilization = 100%.
5) Free float = 2.7M (very tiny float).

Link: https://app.ortex.com/s/Nasdaq/RDBX/short-interest

Here are 5 reasons why this is far and away the best squeeze play on the market….

1) Shares are cheap (only $3.50 per share right now), and there are no options, so this can’t be as easily manipulated as some of the other squeeze plays people are talking about. 

2) This is absolutely critical for people to understand. The free float is only 2.7M. The main reason most squeeze plays don’t end up coming to fruition is because the float is too large. This float is super tiny. 

For comparison, the float of $ATER is 26.2M. I have nothing against ATER, I’m just trying to illustrate how tiny the $RDBX float really is. Think about it…52% of the 2.7M free float is short, which means there are only 1.3M freely traceable shares. All retail has to do is buy the float…that might sound crazy but it’s absolutely doable in this case. It’s only a million shares. If 5,000 people buy 200 shares each, the entire free float will have been bought. 

3) Meme power. We are talking about Redbox here…remember that little red box you used to rent DVDs from outside of your local Walgreens? Yea, that’s the company we are talking about here. One thing GameStop and AMC had that no other squeeze play has had is Meme Power. Redbox has so much meme potential it’s actually incredible. 

4) You might be thinking it makes sense to short this company…after all, it’s a DVD rental business right? WRONG. Redbox has fully pivoted into streaming and is actually a growing player in the streaming space. 

Straight from the company website: 

“Redbox is a leading entertainment company that gives consumers access to a large variety of content across digital and physical media. The company operates a rapidly growing digital streaming service that provides both ad supported (AVOD) and paid movies from Hollywood studios and hundreds of content partners, as well as over 130 channels of free ad supported streaming television (FAST). Redbox also operates its popular kiosks across the US at thousands of retail locations – giving consumers affordable access to the latest in entertainment. The company produces, acquires, and distributes movies through its Redbox Entertainment label, providing rights to talent-led films that are distributed across Redbox’s digital and physical services as well as through third-party digital services.”

Their loyalty program, Redbox Perks, has over 40 MILLION MEMBERS. Redbox is turning into an actually legitimate streaming company. 

Link: https://investors.redbox.com

5) 100% utilization. A lot of people don’t even know what this means, let alone how important it is for a squeeze to take place. Here’s the definition of utilization: “The ratio between the number of shares on loan across all outstanding loans in the wholesale market and the number of shares available for lending at lending programs. 0% means that no shares have been borrowed or lent at these lending programs; 100% means that all shares available to borrow or lend at a lending program have, in fact, been lent. This does not represent the number of shares listed on the exchange that have been lent, because not all listed shares are available for lending; it indicates how much of the supply actually available for lending has been lent. Unless otherwise specified, this is given in decimal format.”

In other words, THERE ARE NO MORE SHARES LEFT TO BORROW. EVERY AVAILABLE SHARE HAS ALREADY BEEN BORROWED. 

⬇️ TLDR ⬇️
$RDBX has 52% short interest as a percent of the free float. The free float is only 2.7M shares. The borrow cost is 320%. There are 0 shares available to borrow due to 100% utilization. 75% of the float is on loan, meaning that there are millions of dollars worth of FTDs (fails to deliver). The company has pivoted into the streaming industry and is actually becoming a very viable business, with over 40M people subscribed to their Redbox Perks program. Last but not least, THINK ABOUT THE MEME POWER. REDBOX HAS GME/AMC LEVEL MEME POWER.

DISCLOSURE: I am long common shares.

EDIT: HIGHS OF $6.15 TODAY BOYS ALREADY UP +75% LETS FUCKING GO

EDIT #2: $RDBX STOCK OFFICIALLY BROKE $10.50 TODAY. I GAVE IT TO YOU AT $3.50. IT IS NOW UP +200% FROM THE TIME I POSTED THIS DD. CHEERS BROTHERS! 🚀🚀🚀",2022-04-28 18:22:43

1295,Need advice!,"I’m 29(M) years old. This is not a rant nor am I looking for sympathy. Rather I’m looking for some advice. My background is very simple. 

I come from humble beginnings and have worked since I was 15 years old. I’ll the be the first to admit that in my young 20s I did some bad decisions. Despite me being ignorant I was able to graduate H.S and graduate from college.

Graduated in ‘15, have a bachelors but the problem is that I’m currently living paycheck to paycheck. I’ve been looking for ways to change that cycle. I have a job and a side job(instacart). I would consider myself somebody who has a positive mindset and is willing to be challenged in any aspect in life.

When the pandemic happened, my interest with investing became getting bigger and bigger. I’m a newbie when it comes to investing. With that said, over the course of 6 years I have built my 401k. Not much but it’s something. I also have another account  with which  I have used some of my personal savings to invest. 

Currently, I’m down about 3k. I know not a lot but it’s a lot for me lol. For now I’m just buying stocks. To name a few, BRQS, PROG, AMC, BBIG. Right now the market seems to be going down. Doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing. Been learning about options and have witnessed that if you do your DD you can profit significantly. Im not piss broke but I have thought about doing options and using some of my 401k to do options. I’m not looking to be the next millionaire but I want to grow my savings a bit more! With that said One day I want to have the ability to buy my own house and help my family. Please let me know what you guys think! Should I borrow from my 401k and do options? Should I go to a Financial advisor first? Any good books out there? Please let me me know! Blessings everyone. 🙏",2022-05-01 15:07:11
1296,THE Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations at AMC Theatres CONFIRMED THAT RETAIL INVESTORS OWN *MORE THAN* 516 MILLION SHARES AND THAT THERE ARE 10498 REGISTERED HOLDERS OF AMC STOCK!!!,"He also confirmed that there are 10.5k apes who have DRS'd their AMC shares through Computershare!

https://preview.redd.it/bi0szqo9rzw81.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b35e516eefc90723bc832e20085e87d0bc0787bf

The current free float of AMC Stock is 515.59 million on webull.

Yahoo finance shows 515.45 million.

Him saying \*\*more than\*\* is a way to tell us what we already know.... \*\*NAKED SHORTS!\*\*

So if 4 million retail investors own \*\*more than\*\* 100% of the free float of AMC, and institutions own  189,148,676 million shares which is 36.60% of AMC's free float [https://fintel.io/so/us/amc](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc) , and short interest of AMC stock's free float is 18.96% which is 97.73 millions shares [https://app.ortex.com/s/NYSE/AMC/short-interest](https://app.ortex.com/s/NYSE/AMC/short-interest).

That would mean 155.56%/802,878,676 shares of AMC Stock is owned! - if my math is wrong, let me know and I'll correct it.

I've seen a lot of people asking for advice, and I thought I should be doing the same.  
I'm 25, I live in an apartment, and I'm currently working in marketing after receiving my bachelor's degree. Since I'm from Canada, I don't have any school debt.

I would like to put around 15k in stock for mid to long term but don't know where to place it. I had my fair share of meme stocks with GME, AMC, etc.

1298,SHF Manipulation and RDBX- What to watch for,"At this point in the game, retail has become very familiar with all of the tactics surrounding SHF, Market Makers, and their tricks of manipulation. We have seen it time and time again with stocks like AMC, GME, PROG, MULN, and BBIG just to name a few. Everything from swapping out short positions to change the DTC, options manipulation, and Dark Pool routing of mass orders to manipulate the price. Well, I’m going to alert you to another one so you can watch it happen in real-time.

One tactic that they love to use is to take out massive amounts of shorts before known dilution (usually by the market makers while retail is left in the dark until after it happens). Often time you’ll see the percent of the FF on loan jump to well over 100%. Retail gets excited, buys, and then the price goes up. Then the dilution happens, and all of a sudden, the SI drops, CTB goes down, and the percent of the FF on loan drops. An example would be PROG. The price was 0.8 and went to 1.12 and excitement was high, 104% (FF on loan) to be exact. Well, then the dilution happened, SI went to 40% with no price increase, and then retail freaked out. Retail didn't learn about this until it was over.

Now that we are aware of this tactic, we can all watch it happen in real-time. RDBX % of FF on loan is 108% and has seen massive jumps as of recent. According to RDBX 8-k, warrants are available for dilution on May 10th. However, the dilution availability is relatively low compared to others at 19.9% (12.6 million Shares outstanding * 0.2= 2.5 million shares). Some dilution has been 50% to even close to 100% in some instances. This is not a lot, but it’s enough to shake retail if there are not aware it’s going to happen. RDBX has seen the price jump from $2 to $11 with no covering in sight. Then during a Profit taking period, they shorted it more in order to lower the price down to the $7 range.

Right now, those who are short on RDBX have exposed themselves to a massive amount of risk. Because from now until May 10 retail could drive the price up and there’s not a thing they could do about it because RDBX has no options which make for less manipulation ability. And because they are driving the price up, retail knowing that May 10 is coming could make a choice to either drive the price up and then sell before May 9, or take it one step further and continue to push through the dilution with buying pressure and trap the shorts in a very difficult position. None of this is financial advice, just making retail aware of what is going to happen. We have the options of what to choose to do because we are finally getting all of the information and are aware of their games.",2022-05-04 14:01:42
1299,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 9th, 2022","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 9th, 2022.

# **Stocks could see more tumult next week, especially if bond yields continue to scream higher - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/stocks-could-see-more-tumult-next-week-especially-if-bond-yields-continue-to-scream-higher.html)**
*****
> After a week of extraordinary turbulence, stocks are likely to remain volatile as investors await fresh data on inflation and watch the course of bond yields.
*****
> The big report for markets is Wednesday’s April consumer price index. Economists expect a high inflation reading, but it should moderate from the 8.5% year-over-year pace of March. A second inflation report, the producer price index, which is a gauge of wholesale prices, is released Thursday.
*****
> “I think it’s going to be a hot number but not as sizzling as last month,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Zandi expects headline CPI to rise 0.3% for the month or 8.2% year-over-year.
*****
> Investors are honing in on inflation and other key reports that will influence the Federal Reserve as it moves forward with interest rate hikes.
*****
> The Fed raised its fed funds target rate by a half percentage point Wednesday, and signaled it could follow up with more hikes of the same size. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, following the meeting, said he expects the economy could see a “soft or soft-ish” landing.
*****
> “I think the two big concerns for the market are inflation and how hawkish the Fed will be trying to get that under control,” said Art Hogan chief market strategist at National Securities. Hogan said investors are also concerned about China’s economy as it locks down to fight Covid and how that slowing could impact the rest of the world.
*****
> Hogan said if the CPI comes in as expected that could bring some stability to both stocks and bonds, since it would then appear that inflation has peaked.
*****
> Stocks were wildly volatile in the past week, notching big intraday swings in both directions. The S&P 500, closed at 4,123 and was down just 0.2% for the week. The Nasdaq was off 1.5% for the week
*****
> Energy was by far the best performing sector, rising 10% for the week. REITs were the worst performing, down more than 3.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 3.4%.
*****
> Stock investors have also been eyeing the bond market, where yields have been rising as bonds sold off.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield pushed through 3% for the first time since late 2018 in the past week. On Friday, the yield was at 3.13%, up from 2.94% the Friday before. The rising 10-year yield has had a stranglehold on stocks, particularly growth and tech, during its rapid move higher.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year was at about 1.5% at the start of the year. Many lending rates are linked to it, including mortgages.
*****
> “If people figure out inflation is peaking, and you could make the argument that the 10-year yield will not necessarily peak, but will stop going parabolic...that’s what could get the public to slow down the selling,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI.
*****
> Emanuel said retail investors have been heavily invested in growth names. Those stocks do better when money is cheap.
*****
> “The bond market is calling the tune here,” he said. But he expects the stock market is in the process of finding its low-water mark. “What we’ve seen is both upside and downside volatility in equities…and that’s the start of a bottoming process.”
*****
> Some technical analysts said stocks could take another dip lower if the S&P returns to Monday’s low of 4,062 and stays there.
*****
> Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, targeted 3,850 on the S&P as the next stop lower, if the index breaks the Monday low.
*****
> “As of now, it looks like every rally where you can get an oversold bounce has been sold,” he said. “I think the weekend news is going to play a factor into the emotional open Monday.”
*****
> He said there could be news on Ukraine, since it is Victory Day in Russia, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to speak.
*****
> Redler said Microsoft and Apple could have a big impact on trading next week. If Apple breaks support at about $150 and Microsoft breaks $270, a level it’s been holding, the two biggest stocks could sweep the S&P 500 below 4,000.
*****
> “If they break those levels, it will add some grease to the wheels and bring the market to new lows. That could bring us closer to a tradeable low,” he said. Apple ended Friday at $157.28 per share, slightly higher on the day.
*****
> Redler said if Microsoft breaks the $270 level, its chart would complete a negative head and shoulders formation that could signal more weakness for the stock. Microsoft closed at $274.73 per share Friday.

> # 1970 All Over Again?

> This comparison of 1960 & 1970 to 2022 was first presented to subscribers & @CMTAssociation Symposium. 2022 is tracking eerily close to those two bear market years. Today’s mammoth drop, the worst since 2020, doesn’t alleviate this alarming comparison.

> Both 1960 and 1970 hosted recessions and rate increases in the prior year. Inflation in 1970 was closer to current conditions with CPI peaking around 6.5% year-over-year. At the end of April 2022 S&P 500 was down 13.3%, the worst start since 1939. Only 1932 & 1939 were worse. The second worst start since WWII was 1970.

> It would be nice if 2022 played out more like 1960 with milder losses. Unfortunately, present circumstances are more akin to 1970. 1960 was also an election year, while 1970 was a midterm year like 2022.

> This time is a little different due to covid-disrupted supply chains and the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with soaring energy and commodity prices. We are not implying the 36% bear market losses from the 1968 top to the 1970 bottom are in the cards, but we suspect that we have not found bottom just yet.

> However, it is becoming increasingly likely we get a bottom sooner rather than later as we did in May 1970 with the Fed raising rates 50 basis points this week and Russia looking to chalk up a victory on WWII Victory Day celebrated on May 9 in Russia.

> # Fed Day Follow Up

> In last night's Closer, we recapped the market reaction to the FOMC's 50 bps rate hike noting that equities really took off once Fed Chair Powell ruled out the possibility of 75 bps hikes on the horizon. By the close, the S&P 500 rallied 2.55% from right before the decision (1:59 PM). As shown below, that marked the third-best S&P 500 reaction to a Fed day since 1994 when the FOMC began to announce its decision on the same day as the meeting.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/050522-Fed-Day-Follow-Up-1.png))**

> Given today's massive declines, the S&P has already erased its 2%+ post-FOMC gain. Below we show the S&P's intraday performance the day after each Fed day when the index rallied over 2% post-meeting (1:59 to the close). For each day, the date shown represents the day of the FOMC meeting. On average, the S&P 500 has tended to gap down the following day and continue to trade lower throughout the first post-FOMC session as we are seeing today.

> Today's performance is certainly on the weaker end of these occurrences, though. In fact, like the other two largest post-FOMC rallies that saw over 3% gains in the afternoon of Fed days, December 2008 and August 2011, today saw a significant gap lower with continued losses through mid-morning. The continued selling today is setting up to more closely resemble the August 2011 occurrence. Following the December 2008 instance, on the other hand, the S&P 500 found a low in the late morning and even briefly went positive the day after the big post-FOMC gain.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/050522-Fed-Day-Follow-Up-2a.png))**

> While today is shaping up to look like another time the market rallied hard in response to the FOMC, taking a step back to look at all Fed day afternoon performance (1:59 to the close) versus next-day performance (full day), there is not much of a strong trend. As shown below, the S&P 500's performance from 1:59 to the close on a Fed day is a statistically poor explainer of next-day performance. That being said, today does stand out as one of the worst Fed day follow-ups on record.

> # NASDAQ Midterm Seasonal Pattern Trends Lower

> NASDAQ’s midterm election year trend is no friend of the bulls. Off 21.2% year-to-date at the end of April clearly significantly lower than the average NASDAQ midterm year decline. But that does not mean that the decline is over. A plethora of headwinds from the War in Ukraine, negative GDP, midterm year and seasonal pressures, supply chain issues, inflation, and rate hikes are likely to conspire to push stocks lower in the near term, a prototypical midterm bottom does appear on the horizon over the next few months, which sets up the quadrennial buying opportunity ahead of the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle.

> # The Quitter Market

> If it seems to you like the market simply can't hold on to gains this year, you aren't mistaken. The chart below shows an intraday composite of the S&P 500 on a median basis over the last 100 trading days through the end of April. The general pattern during this period has been for the market to open modestly higher, but then sell off for the remainder of the morning. It has then regained its footing shortly after mid-day but then sells off into the close.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/050422-Intraday-Composite.png))**

> How does the last five months or so compare to history? The charts below really put the recent trend of intraday weakness into perspective.

> The first chart shows the number of days over a rolling 100-trading day period that the S&P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) traded in positive territory on an intraday basis but finished the day down. The reading currently stands at 38 and was as high as 40 (red line) in the last week of April. As shown in the chart below, there hasn't been another period that the S&P 500 has had so much trouble holding onto intraday gains in more than a decade (October 2010)!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/050422-SPY-Up-But-Finished-Down.png))**

> For the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ), it has been a similar story. As recently as April 22nd, the trailing number of times in the last 100-trading days that QQQ traded in positive territory on an intraday basis but finished the day lower reached 42 and currently stands at 40. Like SPY, the recent reading of 42 was the highest number of occurrences in a 100-trading day span since October 2010.

> For both indices, the currently elevated frequency of giving up intraday gains has been extremely uncommon for the post-financial crisis period. Interestingly enough, though, in the ten years before the financial crisis, these types of periods were a lot more common, especially for the Nasdaq. Could it have anything to do with the fact that the last 12 years have also been one of the more accommodative monetary environments investors have ever experienced?

*****

> # Bond Market Massively Oversold

> The sell-off in bond prices over the last six months has been extreme to say the least. There are a number of ways we could highlight the carnage for bond investors, but one way is to look at how far bond indices are trading below their 200-day moving averages. As shown below, the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Market Total Return index is currently 8.5% below its 200-day moving average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/aggbond.png))**

> Going back to 1988 when daily price data begins, the 200-DMA spread is currently 2x more negative than any prior extreme oversold reading.

> # Recent 21-Year May Seasonal Pattern: More Chop Likely

> May’s first two days have historically traded higher. Recent market volatility suggests another day of gains could prove challenging especially as the market awaits the Fed’s next move on Wednesday. Bouts of weakness often appears around or on the third, sixth, and twelfth trading days of the month while the last four or five trading days have generally enjoyed respectable gains on average. In midterm years it has generally been better to lighten up on long positions early in May as the entire month tends to be weak (pages 42 and 44 STA 2022).

> # 4 Things You Didn’t Know, But Need To

> 2022 has been one of the worst starts to a year ever for stocks and bonds. The reasons for the rough start, which are widely known, include inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed), soaring yields, the conflict in Ukriane, and a slowing economy.

> So we know all of the worries, but now we’ll take a look at 4 things you might not know, but should.

> A bad start to the year isn’t fun, but it isn’t always a sign of things to come. “2022 ranks as the third worst start to a year ever for the S&P 500 Index,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But looking at the 10 worst starts ever shows that stocks tend to bounce back nicely the rest of the year, up 10% on average.”

> As you can see below, continued huge losses the final 8 months are rare, with potential double-digit gains quite possible. The only years the final 8 months saw stocks lower were in 1941 (U.S. entered World War II), 1962 (The Kennedy Slide and Cuban Missile Crisis), and 1973 (oil spike and recession). We continue to expect the U.S. economy to grow at 3% in 2022 and avoid a recession, so an eventual large snapback rally later this year is quite possible.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-5.4.22.png))**

> The Fed will likely hike rates today (we expect a 50 basis point, or 0.5%, hike). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous Fed rate hiking campaigns has seen stocks perform fairly well. Looking at times of aggressive rate hikes shows that in 1994 the Fed quickly hiked from 3% to 6% and stocks were flat, while over a two-year period from 2004 to 2006 they hiked from 1% to 5.25% and stocks gained 11%. Yes, some periods of rate hikes saw stocks decline, but a period of aggressive hiking simply by itself isn’t a reason to expect stocks to do poorly.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-2-5.4.22.png))**

> Is a bear market possible without a recession? The answer is yes, but quite rare. Given the S&P 500 has corrected nearly 14%, how likely is it that things could spiral into a bear market? Well, if we can avoid a recession (our base case) we’d say the odds are slim.

> Looking back in history, 1987 was the last time the S&P 500 was in a bear market without a recession. Then 1978, 1998, 2011, and 2018 all were more recent years that saw stocks nearly in a bear market (down 19%), but the economy avoided a recession. Adding up everything that we know, we’d side with a decline of 20% still not being our base case, with the market weakness likely closer to a major low than not.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-5.4.22-1.png))**

> Lastly, the S&P 500 peaked on January 2 and so far the low during the correction was on April 29, for a 13.9% correction. Turns out, there have been 24 other corrections since World War II, with an average decline of 14.3%, while it took 133 days to find the ultimate low. Given the current correction is 13.9% and has lasted 117 days already, we are getting into the range where previous corrections indeed hit bottom.

1301,"Expected moves. Amazon, Disney, Coinbase, Palantir, Peloton and more.","## The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by just 0.4% last week, less than the 3.1% move options were pricing. The markets however were quite volatile day to day with large swings higher and lower of more than 5% intra-week. Implied volatility was lower on the week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 2.8% move for the upcoming week (about $12 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 30, down from 33 to start the week and lower than the 36+ intra-week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.8%** (+/- $12)
* QQQ **3.7%** (+/- $12)
* IWM **3.4%** (+/- $6)
* DIA **2.4%** (+/- $8)

## In the News

Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet are set for 20-1 stock splits in the beginning of June, less than a month from now. With both stocks currently near $2300, that would mean a roughly $115 price for each post-split. A recent CBOE study showed that large-cap stocks tend to see initially increased (split-adjusted) volume, volatility, and implied volatility but that effect tapers off over time. Pre split options in AMZN are currently pricing in about a 10% move for the June 10th expiry. That aligns with a post-split levels of about $103 on the downside and about $126 on the upside. Here’s how that expected move looks pre-split:

Alphabet options are pricing slightly less of a move to 6/10 expiry, around 8%.

1302,HYMC catalyst coming for 5/9,"The market in general has been very volatile but I think a positive catalyst for HYMC could help push the stock higher this week. This includes AMC’s quarterly earnings release during after hours on Monday 5/9 which I believe could reflect a surprise profit for the company given solid box office recovery as well as AMC’s investment in HYMC. AMC’s competitor Cinemark (CNK) announced quarterly earnings last week and reported an impressive 303% y/y growth in sales and a net loss of -$74 m. During the quarter, the movie theater industry benefited from blockbusters like Spider-Man and The Batman. Compared to its competitor CNK, I expect AMC to report slightly better y/y sales growth given its leadership position within the industry and I expect them to report a lower net loss from core operations. However, I believe AMC’s headline eps will be positive when including the unrealized gain from the HYMC investment. I also believe CEO Adam Aron will take time in his prepared comments as well as the Q&A portion to highlight the successful HYMC investment and to reiterate his confidence in the deal. Said another way, I believe Aron will help pump/force a squeeze in HYMC stock while AMC stock will also squeeze given the positive headline numbers. That said, I’m bullish on HYMC and believe market makers/shorts are going to lose control with their price manipulation efforts and throw in the towel sooner rather than later.",2022-05-09 01:28:14

# [Dow futures drop more than 500 points as market sell-off continues with yields on the rise](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/08/stock-futures-fall-as-wall-street-looks-to-stabilize-after-rollercoaster-week.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell sharply early Monday, as U.S. rates continued to rise and traders struggled to find their footing after big market swings last week.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 450 points, or 1.4%. S&P 500 futures fell 1.8%, while those for the Nasdaq 100 lost 2.3%.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield hit its highest level since late 2018 on Monday. It was last trading at 3.185%.
*****
> That rate increase put pressure on Big Tech names such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet. Shares of Meta were down 2.5% in the premarket, and Alphabet lost 2.7%. Amazon, Apple and Netflix were all down more than 2% as well.
*****
> Energy stocks fell broadly as U.S. oil futures slid more than 2% to $107.14 per barrel. Occidental Petroleum shares dipped 2.8% before the bell, and Schlumberger slipped 2.4%.
*****
> “We expect markets to remain volatile, with risks skewed to the downside as stagflation risks continue to increase,” wrote Barclays’ Maneesh Deshpande. “While we cannot discount sharp bear market rallies, we think upside is limited.”
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a wild week, as investors weighed the prospects of rising interest rates against the potential of slower economic growth.
*****
> Last week, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.54%, while the S&P 500 and Dow dropped 0.21% and 0.24%, respectively. It was the sixth straight losing week for the Dow, and the fifth straight for the other two major indexes.
*****
> While the cumulative moves for the week were not out of the ordinary, some of the day-to-day swings were eye-popping. The Dow had its best day since 2020 on Wednesday, but then erased all those gains and more on Thursday.
*****
> The short-lived Wednesday rally came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was not considering a 75-basis-point rate hike at upcoming meetings. Stocks and bonds rallied following that comment but reversed course on Thursday.
*****
> Billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper told CNBC’s Scott Wapner on Friday that Powell’s statement was an “unforced error” that contributed to market volatility.
*****
> “Our thinking is that stocks are likely to continue lower because we have not yet seen enough technical evidence to suggest a bottom process has started,” wrote JC O’Hara of MKM Partners. “Technical indicators are not oversold enough. The volume profile has shown little if any signs of real capitulation.”
*****
> First-quarter earnings season is slowing down, but there are several notable reports before the opening bell on Monday, including Palantir and vaccine-makers BioNTech and Novavax.
*****
> In other corporate news, Ford was looking to sell 8 million shares in Rivian Automotive over the weekend, sources told CNBC’s David Faber.
*****
> Investors will also be keeping an eye on the war in Ukraine. U.S. first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to the country on Sunday. The U.S. and Group of Seven countries announced that they would increase short-term financial support for Ukraine as the war with Russia nears the three-month mark.

1304,"There are some stocks that you may not want to short in the near term, caution.","Heavily shorted stocks are popping up all over the board these days---- and retail traders (that's you and me and everyone else that owns a brokerage account) continue to pile on. GME, AMC, FSR and W (Wayfair, to name a few). These are all heavily shorted (in the 20-30% range) and extremely volatile with high Betas. The difference is in ownership!

The first three above mentioned are owned by retail investors (once again, you and me, and everyone that owns an account with one of the brokerages). The institutional investors are the Insurance Companies, Hedge Funds, and Mutual funds); they are huge but they are often, and in fact most times, they are slowww to move. They really don't need to be quick, because they've got globs and globs of assets and their collective ownership of a stock is minimal;  not like, let's say the ARKK ETF, which has all of its assets in a few barrels.

The above-mentioned stock, Wayfair (and let's say another one like ETSY) is mostly institutionally owned - 80% on the former and 89% on the latter. If you want to see in 'real time' how the trades flow across your screen, with whatever brokerage you use, try going to the ""Time & Sales' platform for the particular stock you want to look at. All of the brokerages have a 'time & sales' screen on their platforms. You can view the sales happening in real-time. in what denominations, and how quickly their tickers move. I keep one of my screens filled with exactly 20 companies ( The Faangs, the value, the oils, and the me-me stocks ). I've been using this tool (my favorite) for the past 20 years of my 35 years of trading stocks - eight of those years at full-full time, including many sleepless nights ( and days ) and in both the pre-market and after-hours - both of which are mostly a waste of energy; I'll tell you why in another post. The best advice is to get more sleep and start your trading at 8:30 A.M. when all the really important figures get posted several times during the week ( like the Fed, the PPI, and the CPI- and don't forget wages and employment ).

You'll see stock movements like the ticker tapes you've seen on all the documentaries ever made about the roaring 20's and beyond. Tesla and Amazon are prime examples of retail stocks that almost never stop moving. Wayfair is a mostly institutionally owned stock that moves in spurts and long pauses in between trades. Institutional and slow and mostly boring - but there's $ at stake.

When a stock like Wayfair ramps along at a hundred shares and another hundred and the two-forty it would seem to be very non-descript; and then the power comes in at the close---right at 4:00 P.M. - when the ""institutional"" sellers dump their load with a ""sell at the close order""- that's when you'll see ( on the white bars) orders of 138,000, 212,000 and then a few 2,900 orders, and on and on.

The point of these notes is to try to help you recognize when to jump (and /or not) into the water.

I trade a lot of options and I'm trying to assist you with my personal perspective and hopefully try a winning trade without trying to hit a homer each time at-bat, mostly with an option or two.

I have a feeling that these next few days will be an opportunity for a long-play or call option, especially in these next 3-4 days- and on the stock like Wayfair. I generally don't play very short-term options like a week or two away. This play, I believe, is an exception. I have long term puts on this stock ( which is, incidentally forming a 'near perfect head-and shoulder' pattern to the down-side if you look at the 5-year chart.

I've got a little on a May 13th and  20th call options with Wayfair touching on the 78-79 figure. We'll have to wait and see and if you try it - bet only what you can afford to lose - but I think it's a short-term winner - and the shorts have stacked up so high there simply aren't many buyers- the shorts are pounding at one another as they continue to recoil back up the stairs, and be happy with their deteriorating positions. Best of luck.

To a ""dancing God""

1305,"AMC Defies Skeptics, Again","Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) jumped 2.56% in after-hours trading on Monday after the movie theater operator posted positive earnings.

Financials: AMC reported a loss of 52 cents per share and revenue of $785.7 million; both were better than expected.

Movies: The movie theater chain attributed its financial results to successful films such as Spider-Man: No Way Home, The Batman, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Upcoming films include Top Gun: Maverick, Lightyear, and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

Quote: “Our results for the first quarter of 2022 represent AMC’s strongest first quarter in two full years. We continue on our pandemic recovery trajectory, more than quintupling revenues and improving adjusted EBITDA by nearly eighty percent compared to a year ago.” - AMC CEO Adam Aron.

Balance Sheet: AMC has strong liquidity, refinanced some of its debt, launched NFTs (non-fungible tokens), started to accept cryptocurrency as payment, and invested in a gold mining business. Some of these moves were viewed as odd business endeavors akin to a meme stock, but the results have been good for AMC’s balance sheet.

Numbers: Shares of AMC are down 52% so far in 2022.

Final Thoughts: Despite the recent success, AMC is still losing money.

1307,What can you do or say to prevent friends/family members from committing suicide that started investing after the meme movement in Jan 2021?,"I know a couple of people who saw the AMC/GME thing in the news and thought the stock market was a place to make cash quick and take them out of poverty. Others saw Elon Musk host SNL and that coin that cant be named rising and invested in that.

So 15 months later they all lost their life savings and are down between 85-99% on their capital. They even put their emergency fund into it since they thought buying the dip would reward them not knowing buying the dip is for good companies not those coins, meme stocks, certain SPACs, etc. Im now hearing them making suicide remarks that they want to end it because they cant tell their wives or family about their losses. What can I do to help them if anything.",2022-05-12 09:03:33
1308,Warner Bros. Discovery: A bargain?,"WarnerMedia was recently spun into Discovery Inc, creating the world's second largest media company and possibly the most profitable. Instead of generating enthusiasm, it entered into a declining market that is particularly skeptical of media stocks, and the combined companies are now trading at one of their lowest valuations in decades.

&#x200B;

**Media stock slump**

Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Lionsgate, WBD, and AMC have all slumped recently, with some of them (including WBD) trading for P/E's below ten and P/S's below one.

It seems to be largely due to speculation that consumers will cut down on their steaming services and/or cable due to inflation. A possible recession (with -1.4% GDP growth in Q1) may also harm ad sales. Personally, I don't think the change will be too drastic, since cable TV and box office sales have historically been inflation resistant. Both HBO Max and Discovery+ had subscriber growth in Q1, and in their recent earnings call Discovery increased ad revenues in Q1 and say they have continued to grow into Q2.

The Netflix situation has also created pessimism around the streaming business model. They have forecasted a 1.3% decline in subscribers over the first half of the year. 700k of the 2.7m loss were subscribers from Russia. They also had a significant price increase and did terribly on content, increasing spending on Netflix originals by billions but failing to produce breakout hits besides Squid Game. I don't see how this particular situation should affect views on streaming overall.

&#x200B;

**WBD Highlights**

\-WarnerMedia had $35.6b revenue in 2021, and Discovery had $12.2b, for a total of $47.8b. This could go up this year due to rebounding box office revenues.

\-Current market cap is $43.9b. $55b debt means they have an enterprise value in the $90b range. Fortunately Discovery issued $30b in bonds earlier in the year when interest rates were lower.

\-WarnerMedia had about $8b operating income each year over the past 2 years. In the 2 years before the AT&T merger, they had $3.9b and $5.2b net income.  Discovery had $1.1b net income last year.

\-They have estimated $3b+ in cost savings, which a BOA analyst called ""conservative"". This produces a bull case of over $10b in annual profits (which should be the case if media spending doesn't fall dramatically and if they have more hits than misses with their content).

\-Own multiple large studios

\-Produce over 100 shows, more than half for third parties

\-Top 2 at the box office 11 of the past 12 years

\-Number one media company in the US in terms of hours viewed. Having such a large reach across a variety of niches should give them an advantage in ad sales.

&#x200B;

**Management**

AT&T management is not well regarded. They are seen as having completed multiple ill-conceived acquisitions.  CNN+ and the decision to release movies simultaneously on HBO Max in 2020/21 and a 45-day window in 2022 have generally been seen as failures. However, they did invest heavily in assembling a strong content lineup.

David Zaslav and the Discovery management team have completed numerous successful acquisitions, maintaining consistent profitability while quadrupling revenue.

&#x200B;

**Content**

With over 100 shows in production and over 1000 other movies/shows in their library, there's way to much to list but here are some of the highlights.

Discovery: TLC, HGTV, Food Network, etc. While not really producing ""prestige content"", they have a lot of stuff that is highly bingeable. This is is why Discovery+ generates more revenue on it's $4.99 ad-supported tier than it's $6.99 premium tier, and also has one of the lowest churns in streaming.

Combining Discovery+, HBO Max, Cartoon Network, Turner Sports, and CNN (which will be focused on solidifying its reputation as the world's leading fact-based journalism organization) can create the most varied streaming platform on the market.

DC: They have an upcoming lineup of films that they have put more time and money into than most of their previous releases: League of Super Pets, Black Adam, Shazam 2, Aquaman 2, and the Flash are all coming in the next 13 months. They also have upcoming series such as Peacemaker Season 2, Justice League Dark (directed by JJ Abrams), Green Lantern Corps, Penguin & Arkham series, and Michael B. Jordan's Superman series.

Harry Potter: More films planned

Lord of the Rings: They say they still have exclusive film rights and have an upcoming animated movie (War of the Rohirrim) in pre-production. I'm guessing they'll start making live action films after that, although they're still in mediation with the Saul Zaentz company.

Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon prequel series coming in August. They also have a big-budget The Last of Us series coming.

&#x200B;

One of the world's leading TV show studios, including being the kings of the sitcom genre. Even for shows that air on different networks, they usually retain significant rights. Shows include: Friends, Sienfeld, Full House, Fresh Prince, Family Mattes, Murphy Brown, Ted Lasso, Two and a Half Men, Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon, The Batchelor, Fringe, ER, Person of Interest, etc.

Own the classic MGM & RKO pictures libraries: The Wizard of Oz (remake planned), Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane, etc.

Looney Tunes & Hanna Barbara (Scooby Doo, The Flinstones, The Jetsons, etc.)

&#x200B;

Film series in their library include: Dune (part 2 coming), Rush Hour, Lethal Weapon, Austin Powers, Friday the 13th, Mortal Kombat (sequel planned), Gremlins, Nightmare on Elm Street, Bullit (sequel coming, directed by Steven Spielberg), Mad Max (Furiosa prequel coming), The Conjuring, Godzilla/King Kong, Lego movies, Ocean's, and The Matrix.  They plan to have multiple mid-budget remakes/reboots each year on HBO Max.

&#x200B;

Upcoming Games: Hogwarts Legacy, Gotham Knights, Justice League: Kill the Suicide Squad, and Harry Potter: Magic Awakened (mobile game in partnership with NetEase, has already grossed over $200m in Asia and awaiting global release)

&#x200B;

**Big Tech, Antitrust, and the Steaming Wars**

Right now it seems like there are too many competitors in streaming, with Apple and Amazon increasing their spending in addition to Netflix and the legacy media companies. When asked, the leaders at NBC Universal, Paramount, WBD, and Lionsgate have left the door open to merging or at least partnering.

There's also talk of increasing antitrust. If this materializes they may be prevented from merging, but big tech will also probably be prevented from increasing their presence in streaming (FTC head Lina Khan is a big critic of Amazon Prime and big tech in general).

In the most recent earnings call, Zaslav repeatedly emphasized that WBD was the world's greatest ""content production factory"" and the world's ""leader in IP"". He even referred to WBD as ""arms dealers"". He talked about diversified revenue streams but never gave a long-term forecast for HBO max subscribers or boasted about them becoming a leader in streaming. It seemed like he was implying that if the spending wars intensified (presumably if Apple and Amazon continue to increase spending), WBD will focus more on licensing rather than growing their subscriber numbers (in this scenario HBO and Discovery+ will go back to being niche services).",2022-05-13 15:22:45

1310,Financially illiterate. Complete novice. Need help.,"Hi everyone, I am 22 and I basically have no idea where to keep my money in order for it to grow substantially over the coming years. I have about 60K saved up (I am a Computer Science student, and earned a lot during my internships in school, and never had to pay for bills because of wealthy parents). 

Right now, the money is just sitting in my Chequings account in CIBC. I read about TFSAs and RRSP but it's very confusing to know what exactly they offer and what the benefits are. I'm also open to investing a portion of it, and keeping the bulk of it for the long-term and let it grow steadily.

My future plans: I recently graduated and got a job at Amazon as a Software Engineer. After I start my job there in July, I'll be receiving a healthy sum of money consistently too. As of now, I have no bills to pay (I stay with my parents). The only payments I make are personal expenditures and travel. However, I do want to get a property too (when I hit the 24-25 year old mark). 

What is the best option for me?

1311,AMC’s Newest Investment,"Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) jumped 3.64% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the movie theater operator revealed that it invested in a cinema-related company.

Details: AMC disclosed that it bought a 6.8% stake in National CineMedia (Nasdaq: NCMI), a cinema advertising company. In total, the company bought 5.9 million units of stock in the company.

Immediate Bounce: Shares of National CineMedia jumped 31.03% in after-hours trading.

History: AMC, which benefited from the meme stock mania of 2021, has tried to reinvent itself. The pandemic crushed the movie theater industry. AMC has diversified its revenue by making all sorts of investments, including an investment in a gold mining business. Obviously, investing in a cinema advertising company makes more sense for AMC.

Background: National CineMedia reported earnings last week. The company reported a loss of 20 cents per share, which was below estimates, and revenue of $35.9 million, which was better than expected.

Numbers: Both stocks have seen better days. In the past six months, National CineMedia has dropped 58% and AMC has dropped 68%.

Final Thoughts: Oddly enough, National CineMedia does offer a small dividend to investors.

1312,"Melvin Capital, hedge fund torpedoed by the GameStop frenzy, is shutting down.","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/18/business/melvin-capital-gamestop-short.html

Melvin Capital, the hedge fund run by Gabe Plotkin that struggled with heavy losses last year as it reeled from wrong-way bets on GameStop, is shutting down, according to a letter sent to investors on Wednesday that was reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Plotkin wrote to his investors that he had decided that the “appropriate next step” was to liquidate the fund’s assets and return cash to all investors. Mr. Plotkin, who founded Melvin in 2014, also wrote that he recognized he needed to “step away from managing external capital.” 

Mr. Plotkin, a protégé of the hedge fund billionaire and New York Mets owner Steven A. Cohen, had wagered that shares GameStop, AMC Entertainment and other mall mainstays from the 1990s would fall as their businesses shrank. Instead, the stocks skyrocketed when amateur investors, coordinating via Reddit, Twitter and other social media sites and determined to outsmart big Wall Street funds, kept buying up shares and propping up their price. That caused Melvin, which had $8 billion in assets under management in January 2021, to lose billions of dollars as it scrambled to cover its so-called short positions. It was propped up by a $2.75 billion bailout from the hedge funds Point72, run by Mr. Cohen, and Citadel, as well as fresh capital from new investors. Before deciding to shutter his fund, Mr. Plotkin had considered reconstituting it. The decision to close Melvin, which Mr. Plotkin named after his late grandfather, is a blow to Mr. Plotkin’s reputation. He had gained fame as one of the most successful portfolio managers to emerge from Mr. Cohen’s former hedge fund, SAC Capital.",2022-05-18 18:28:06

1315,BBBY (Bed Bath & Beyond) - What Gives?,"**Disclosure**: I hold a modest long position in this ticker, currently underwater by about 25%, no biggie.

I opened my BBBY position in March 2022 when Ryan Cohen (he of Chewy and GameStop fame) bought his 9.5M BBBY shares for a \~10% stake in the company and then engaged in a very aggressive social media campaign against the company's executives and its ""over price consultants"". Ultimately, Cohen was able to secure 3 Board seats on the company for his hand-picked associates, and now has quite a bit of sway regarding the company's future:

BBBY is now trading at about a **0.11x** price-to-sales ratio, and Ryan Cohen has announced that he thinks the profitable **BuybuyBaby** chain should be sold off (for several times more than the company's current market cap) in order to erase BBBY's debt and narrow the parent company's scope. This idea has some merit to it, and has been discussed before:

* [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/buybuy-baby-may-be-worth-more-than-all-of-bed-bath-beyond-bank-of-america-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/buybuy-baby-may-be-worth-more-than-all-of-bed-bath-beyond-bank-of-america-says.html)

Currently, BBBY is trading at around $8, with a paltry $650M market cap, against annual revenues of approx. $8bn in 2021. It historically has traded as high as $80 (2013-2015) and even $44 in 2021 (June 2, 2021). BBBY has also bought back $1bn worth of its shares in recent years, and clearly considers its own share price to be very undervalued:

In addition to buying 9.5M shares between $13-17 (\~$150,000,000), Cohen also purchased a ton of Jan 2023 Calls (16,701 contracts) with $60-$80 strike prices:

Ryan Cohen has been very vocal on his Twitter account since the New Year regarding inflation, monetary policy, and the Fed. He clearly has more than a passing knowledge of, and interest in, the current state of the economy. Of course, no mention of BBBY and Ryan Cohen would be complete without mentioning the short interest in the ticker ([20M shares publicly reported short, or 25% of total shares outstanding. But somehow 84% of the float according to Yahoo Finance??!](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/key-statistics?p=BBBY)) and the stock's weird trading correlation with other so-called ""meme stocks"" like GME, AMC. For example, BBBY had a huge price and volume spike on June 2, 2021, the same day that GME and other meme stocks also experienced massive price spikes and trading. However, I will leave aside speculation as to what that correlation might be caused by, or what it imply for the future of the share price.

I keep struggling to think of any reason why a successful activist investor like Ryan Cohen would drop that kind of dough without a very serious plan to turn the company around, even in this difficult economic climate.

Is anyone else fascinated with this stock's future and curious to see how it all shakes out? Will Ryan Cohen's 17,000 Jan 2023 options contracts ""print"", or will his bet end up on WSB's loss porn hall of fame?

I am very curious to hear other people's take on this stock!",2022-05-25 13:36:30

1317,Sharing a 100% risk-free but relatively low-return strategy,"*Update: I received many comments on the strategy is equivalent to buying a CD or worse than selling naked puts or covered calls. I wish to highlight that this strategy can net a risk-free 4% to 5% relatively easily in this kind of stock market with some tech and penny stocks via selling ITM calls and buying OTM puts. The 2.68% annual return is an example using SPY via ATM calls and puts, which is much easier to understand for sharing purpose, but this strategy can surely do better. If you are looking for a risk-free 10% return, no, I do not identify any such strategy yet, and I will not share it if I found it.*

The strategy is:

1. Buy 100 shares of SPY (e.g., at $415/share)
2. Sell ATM call leap with same strike (e.g., Dec 2024 $415C nets $6,300)
3. Buy ATM put leap with same strike (e.g., Dec 2024 $415P costs $5,000)
4. Collect dividends (e.g., \~$1,400 for 2.5 years when not including Q4 2024's dividend)

All the numbers above are by market close on 5/27/2022. This nets us a risk-free $2,700 using $38,800 (\~6.96% over 2.6 years, or \~2.68% per year). Due to stock market crash, call leaps now worth more than put leaps.

**Yes, 2.68% is not a good return. Try this strategy with some big tech or penny stocks (those with no dividends) by selling ITM call leaps and buying OTM put leaps. 5% (may be even up to 8%) is achievable, but we need to wait for the limit price transaction to go through. Patience is the key.**

Tip 1: This is a high volatility strategy. You want SPY at lower price as much as possible (like $380 last week, not $415 yesterday). Deploy it during a big red day to maximize profits.

Tip 2: The best moment has sailed, so this tip doesn't apply anymore to ""high"" interest rate environment for next few years. Around a year ago, we could borrow multiple years of money at rate < 1% via selling SPX options box spreads (note: SPX options will not get exercised before due date) and use them to deploy this strategy to big tech stocks *now*. Assuming 5% risk-free return, this will net us a risk-free 4% for every 1x borrowing. Not recommending borrowing a lot (no risk on paper doesn't mean no risk in practice), but we can tune our leverage based on our risk appetite. For example, 2x leverage means a risk free 9% return for deploying this strategy to the tech and penny stocks.

Tip 3: This strategy doesn't work on some (not all) meme stocks like GME, AMC, UPST etc. due to the put leaps costing more than the call leaps.",2022-05-28 14:44:03

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit lower to start the new week. After finally snapping the 7-week losing streak, it remains to be seen whether this rally will continue or if it is simply another bounce on the way down. If you check out SPY's weekly chart, you'll see that last week's volume was less than each of the previous 5 red weeks. This week figures to be lower volume as well because of the short week, but I'll be watching resistance levels closely, as volume trends make me think we'll be rejecting resistance levels at some point this week. Key resistance level for SPY at 430. At the time of writing, S&P Futures are down \~70 basis points, Dow Futures are up \~70 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are up \~45 basis points. SPY support levels at 412, 410, 406, 404, and 400. Relevant resistance levels at 414, 415, 420, 425, and 430. Crude oil is breaking out, currently trading a bit under $119 per barrel. Good to see the breakout as I've been saying this for a few weeks now. Energy stocks are seeing strength in premarket trading and will be worth following today and through the rest of the week. Crude oil could continue its strength given the recent agreement by EU leaders to stop purchases of crude oil and other petroleum products from Russia. Chinese stocks are also seeing strength after reports of Chinese authorities ending the two-month COVID lockdown; worth following today as well. Meme stocks also started heating up last week, worth following to see if the momentum continues.

1322,Goldman Sachs says the meme stock revolution is over. U.S. retail investors have sold most of what they bought over the last two years,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-revolution-over-goldman-165449356.html

Retail investors flooded into so-called meme stocks like AMC and GameStop during the pandemic hoping to net quick profits in a market that just seemed to keep on soaring. In 2022, with interest rates climbing and the stock market struggling, it’s a different story. Goldman Sachs analysts, led by David J. Kostin, revealed in a Tuesday research note that retail investors have sold most of their U.S. stock purchases from the last two years. And over the last seven weeks alone, $26 billion has flowed out of U.S. equity ETFs and mutual funds, which are often traded by retail investors. Rising stock prices, stimulus checks, and near-zero interest rates led investors to rush into the stock market like never before during the pandemic. In fact, U.S. investors sank more than $1 trillion into stocks in 2021 alone, the Financial Times reported in December. That’s more than the prior 20 years combined, and three times more than the previous annual record. On top of that, the “democratization” of investing due to the expansion of low-cost trading applications like Robinhood, and the birth of large online communities of traders on forums like Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, spawned a meme stock revolution in 2021.

Meme stocks are equities that gain a cultlike following on social media platforms. Typically, these stocks are targeted by retail traders due to their high short interest, which means that a large number of short-sellers—traders who bet a stock’s price will fall by borrowing shares and then selling them at market price hoping to buy the shares back at a later date for less—have shorted the stock, making it susceptible to something called a short-squeeze. A short-squeeze happens when short-sellers are forced to buy shares (i.e., cover their shorts) in order to exit their positions as a stock rises, pushing the stock even higher. The meme stock era propelled the share prices of formerly unloved, and mostly unprofitable, names like GameStop to new heights in the first few months of 2021. The video game retailer eventually saw its shares jump over 2000% to a short-lived record high of $483 by Jan. 28. Leading up to that record, the number of unique accounts trading GameStop on a given day increased from fewer than 10,000 at the beginning of the year to nearly 900,000 by the end of January, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission report.

Now, though, with a slew of macroeconomic headwinds from the war in Ukraine to sky-high inflation hurting stock market returns, the retail crowd has all but abandoned its meme stock heroes. Shares of GameStop are down over 50% in the past year to around $120, and AMC has fared even worse, with shares plummeting nearly 60% to $13 over the same period. Goldman Sachs says the rise of retail investors and the meme stock movement was largely a result of a narrative they call TINA, or “there is no alternative.” The idea is that because interest rates were so low, savings accounts, government bonds, and other interest-rate-sensitive investing alternatives just didn’t pay enough to be worthy of investment by the retail crowd. As a result, there was record investment into risk assets like tech stocks, meme stocks, and cryptocurrencies as investors hunted for stronger returns. “Since 2020, fiscal stimulus, near-zero interest rates, and record-high equity allocations supported TINA … But investors are now facing rising interest rates and recession concerns,” the analysts wrote, adding that there has been a sharp reversal of the TINA trend over the past few months. It’s now the age of TARA, or “there are reasonable alternatives,” Goldman says, and that’s reversing households’ aggressive stock purchases, which have significantly contributed to the recent stock market selloff.",2022-06-03 12:16:26
1323,A comprehensiv Analysis into Solo Brands ($DTC) and why it might be a good Investment.,"# Hi there,

# First of all,

This analysis may be a bit longer, but it might be a worthwhile read no matter, if are looking for new Stocks to invest or not. I will go through diffrent metrics, that affect the supply and demand side of any given Stock and therefore help us evaluate the fair share price.

Investing your own money should always be taken very seriously, therefore I won\`t just write „LFG to the Moon!“, pls don't invest your money solely on MEME\`s and do your own research.

In the current Market condition some Companies are severely undervalued, but as always in history they will bend towards their „fair“ Valuation over time. Our target as Investors is to find those Companies that are not yet appropriately valued by the markets and/or have simply been overlooked.

In my estimation $DTC is such a Company, which flew under the radar for too long, while having high revenue growth year-over-year and a profitable business model and some more positive factors.

I will try to make the nitty-gritty stuff as easy to understand as possible, while not being too simplistic. For a an nice overview of current fundamentals take a look at: [https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-dtc/solo-brands](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-dtc/solo-brands)

# The Business model

To determine the demand side we have to take a thorough look at Solo Brands ($DTC) business model. They are acquiring new brands with name recognition, that have a dedicated following in the Consumer base. They are owner of brands like Solo Stove and Cubbies, therefor fill a lucrative niche in the market. Their sales consist partly from retail vendors (≈ 15%), but are especially driven through online Markets (≈85%), which offers easier growth opportunity and greater profit margins. Expansion into international Markets began in Oct. 2021 and will be one of the largest contributing growth factors in the coming years.

DTC\`s stock market performance is not what I would call stellar so far and has dropped into dirt cheap territory. Allthough $DTC beat the last two Quarter earnings, share price has fallen by over 75% over 6 month. This could offer a great opportunity for investors to enter, but in order to determine this we have to assess the ""fair"" value of $DTC. 

Further Info:[https://sgbonline.com/solo-brands-showcases-direct-to-consumer-differential/](https://sgbonline.com/solo-brands-showcases-direct-to-consumer-differential/)

# Determine Fair Value

We can determine the fair Valuation of DTC by comparing it to similar Companies in the Leisure/Outdoor Industry. if we compare metrics like Price-to-Earnings, Price-to-Sales and Price-To-Book of the broader Industry, a clear picture emerges.

A good example to see how undervalued $DTC is, is the P/B ratio. The current Book Value of $DTC is 571M, while Market Cap. is only 493M, this means a P/B of 0.8x, the Leisure/Outdoor Industry Avr. is 2.6x, which means $DTC is trading more then three times cheaper in this regards.

An exact valuation is highly complex and would take several pages to lay out, but $DTC outperforms the U.S Leisure Industry in every metric based of EoY expectation. The analyst consensus lies at 13.33$ per share. My own evaluation, in context of the current market condition lies around 11$ a share and I tried to be a little more conservative. 

# Outstanding Shares, Free Float and Supply

DTC issued 63.4M shares at IPO and did not dilute their shareholder since then. Shares hold by Insiders and long term institutions belong the the pool of Outstanding Shares (O/S). Shares hold by the Public, Short Hedgefunds (SHF) and mid-term holding Institutions belong to the free float.

The smaller the free float of shares, the better. A small free float means a lower supply of tradable shares.

# Institutions & Insider

**This is were things get really interesting.** According to mandatory ownership filings, 13F/13G, **Institutions own 74,90M out of 64.4M shares**. Yeah, Institutional ownership according to filings is at **118%.** 

[Fintel lists institutional ownership at 136.09&#37;, but a closer look into the official filings revealed 118.15&#37; to be correct. See for yourself https:\/\/fintel.io\/so\/us\/dtc ](https://preview.redd.it/kuwbp45smz391.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7f3f47ab442f3a48097e5033452c6ba5cbbd10db)

# Thats Crazy & Bullish AF

Investor relations of several entities were baffled. The best explanation they offered alluded to the asynchronous nature of ownership filings. Its possible that some Institution already filed newly bought shares, while Institution that sold $DTC did not yet update their ownership. However in many years of researching Stocks I havnt seen anything like that. It is clear that institutions own nearly the complete float, leaving only an extremly small float on the table for the public and Short Hedgefunds.

https://preview.redd.it/8vedshklqz391.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77148238df67e58f8312c5874290d46c31c960ca

**In general a high Institutional ownership is very good, because:**

Shares which are owned by institutions are far less frequently traded. (low supply)

Institutions are less likely sell, especially now, because they bought since IPO at 17$ down to 4$ and will almost never sell for a loss. According to ownership filings the main bulk of shares were bought above 10$.

Institution like to buy shares under the radar, keeping share price low, until they are saturated. After this accumulation phase they let the stock price to go up, in order to sell for a profit. 

Once the stock is ready to go up, it will be pushed by media entities, Jim Cramer etc. **just like that:**

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/dtc-vs-amzn-stock-value-154003155.html Yahoo Finance laying out why $DTC is a better value investment then $AMZN. Interesting?](https://preview.redd.it/n8r8k6upqz391.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ab00ceb68bf1ccc867a39e97509e026bee9dad79)

**Insider:** 

The CEO and CFO of Solo Brand ($DTC) bought 90k shares for almost $500k during the last 7 trading days. Insider on average outperform the Stock Market and have more information about positive and negative news. 

# Short Interest & FTD`s

I know many people on react allergic to those words and they are thrown around far too often, but the recent surge of GME/AMC shows that they should have a legit usage. Just listen to my arguments please before you bash this DD just on those merits.

# What is Short selling?

Hedgefunds can sell Shares short, this works by lending out shares from an entitiy to sell them on the free Market. 

In order to make a profit, they will have to buy those shares back at a later point. 

If the Share price is lower when they buy them back they can pocket the diffrence.

If the share prices goes up, they have to pay more then initially and make a loss.

**Example:**

Short Hedgefund A borrows 10 shares for 5$ each and sells them at the Market. Total: 50$ - After 3 month the share price went from 5$ to 3$. - SHF can buy 10 shares for 30$ and gives them back to the lender. - Short Hedgefund pockets 20$ diffrence.

**Short interest:**

With that out of the way lets look at the latest filing. On the 13th of May 3.21m shares were sold short. We can Assume they were bought above current share price, because $DTC was on a downward trend until recently. So right now they have to buy back the shares they borrowed in order to realize their profits. (increased demand)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zhyok1letz391.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=981fe958897e46d4eac6fdd160c32dd8f6bb014c

As of the latest official SEC filing 3.21 million shares of $DTC were sold short. $DTC\`s share price was in free fall since IPO, but recent developments point to a trend reversal, this offers a great entry point as short seller who close their position significantly drive up the share price.

[See how the chart definitely broke through the yellow trend line - This can be seen as very bullish and a great entry point.](https://preview.redd.it/gfzynqrstz391.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d63b4da272d9013980edceb0313cd2f28fb32d3e)

The recent trend reversal puts pressure on SHF because their profits are melting. This means that up to 3.21million shares need to be bought in order to close out existing short positions.

Ortex, fintel Bloomberg etc. all have diffrent numbers for DTC\`s short interest because they messed up the count of institutional ownership. My observations clearly show a very tiny float with great bullish implications. (Very tiny supply.)

Oh Wednesday and Thursday a Volume of 81k and 116k respectively changed the share price by 3.4% and 3.7%. This points to an illiquid flow and is another indicator for a small float.

So if just a 80k-100k move the price by so much, can you imagine how much the price would move by 3.21m shares? Even better, because $DTC has a very low avr. Daily Volume, of ≈ 600k shares, it will take  several days for to get out of their obligations. As of now they are trying to double down and delay the inevitable - This tactic was commonly observed at other low liquidity short plays, but always fails at some point.

[Solo Stove™ made by Solo Brands.](https://preview.redd.it/hks8qjb9vz391.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bbbe863ea99cf604dea248ba5acc99656c3347f6)

Last but not least we have **485k Failure-to-deliver (FTD\`s)** on May 13th which is a bullish sign as well.

FTD\`s are shares that were bought, but not yet delivered by Market Makers. They have to be bought 35 days after the FTD-date. Next FTD data will be released at 15th of June, so we don't know if even more shares have to be recouped by Market Makers.

# Let me Sum it up - The perfect Storm is brewing. (TLDR)

**$DTC** has a **sustainable and scalable business model,** has increased its revenue by 126% in the last year and is Year-over-Year profitable. Independent analysts **expect $70m in earnings 2022** and beat their last two quarterly earnings estimations. We have **institutions buying up the free float** for months while keeping the share price low, in order to accumulate as much as possible. Look at current filings, it indicates, that they are **very few freely tradable shares available**. Leaving almost nothing on the Table for the public and short sellers. (Low Supply)

At the same time we have short sellers that have to buy back shares in order to profit, therefore hiking the share price and increasing demand. They find themselves at the point of trend reversal and due to low daily volume need **5-6 days to cover** their short positions. At some point those shares have to be bought back in order to realize profits and with sustainable growth year by year it is possible that $DTC saw its All-Time-Low recently. 

Thanks to the low share price and $DTC\`s profitability, the downside risk is quite managable right now, we have **88.8% positive Call option Volume** and a **nice gamma set** up is crystallizing.

Market Makers have to get at least **485k FTD\`s** from the free Market and most importantly, we have a huge army of **capable retail trader**, who know how to take advantage of Market Mechanics, that were used against them for decades. Because of Solo Brands ($DTC) recent run up many retail traders are on notice, the stock got a lot of positive news coverage, which is the best form of free advertisement.

As this DD is already far too long, nobody will ever reach this sentence, so I won't go into a technical chart-analysis, but I will shortly point out, that a breakup of a negative trend channel offers a great opportunity to enter, as a long lasting trend reversal seems to be likely.

**Full Disclosure:** I am long with 5k shares and some options. Always do your own research before investing and know your risk tolerance.

DTC issued 63.4M shares at IPO and did not dilute their shareholder since then. Shares hold by Insiders and long term institutions belong the the pool of Outstanding Shares (O/S). Shares hold by the Public, Short Hedgefunds (SHF) and mid-term holding Institutions belong to the free float.

The smaller the free float of shares, the better. A small free float means a lower supply of tradable shares.

# Institutions & Insider

**This is were things get really interesting.** According to mandatory ownership filings, 13F/13G, **Institutions own 74,90M out of 64.4M shares**. Yeah, Institutional ownership according to filings is at **118%.** 

&#x200B;

[Fintel lists institutional ownership at 136.09&#37;, but a closer look into the official filings revealed 118.15&#37; to be correct. See for yourself https:\/\/fintel.io\/so\/us\/dtc](https://preview.redd.it/g6fd1mkoxz391.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f5a07d27e2da93861b5b5f54fecf2b260d8cd387)

# Thats Crazy & Bullish AF

Investor relations of several entities were baffled. The best explanation they offered alluded to the asynchronous nature of ownership filings. Its possible that some Institution already filed newly bought shares, while Institution that sold $DTC did not yet update their ownership. However in many years of researching Stocks I havnt seen anything like that. It is clear that institutions own nearly the complete float, leaving only an extremly small float on the table for the public and Short Hedgefunds.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d1etiwcrxz391.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18226fcd5335dcb82e95b588d8d032f9c4afe296

**In general a high Institutional ownership is great, because:**

Shares which are owned by institutions are far less frequently traded. (low supply)

Institutions are less likely sell, especially now, because they bought since IPO at 17$ down to 4$ and will almost never sell for a loss. According to ownership filings the main bulk of shares were bought above 10$.

Institution like to buy shares under the radar, keeping share price low, until they are saturated. After this accumulation phase they let the stock price to go up, in order to sell for a profit.

Once the stock is ready to go up, it will be pushed by media entities, Jim Cramer etc. **just like that:**

**Insider:** 

The CEO and CFO of Solo Brand ($DTC) bought 90k shares for almost $500k during the last 7 trading days. Insider on average outperform the Stock Market and have more information about positive and negative news.

# Short Interest & FTD`s

I know many people on react allergic to those words and they are thrown around far too often, but the recent surge of GME/AMC shows that they should have a legit usage. Just listen to my arguments please before you bash this DD just on those merits.

# What is Short selling?

Hedgefunds can sell Shares short, this works by lending out shares from an entitiy to sell them on the free Market. 

In order to make a profit, they will have to buy those shares back at a later point. 

If the Share price is lower when they buy them back they can pocket the diffrence.

If the share prices goes up, they have to pay more then initially and make a loss.

**Example:**

Short Hedgefund A borrows 10 shares for 5$ each and sells them at the Market. Total: 50$ - After 3 month the share price went from 5$ to 3$. - SHF can buy 10 shares for 30$ and gives them back to the lender. - Short Hedgefund pockets 20$ diffrence.

**Short interest:**

With that out of the way lets look at the latest filing. On the 13th of May 3.21m shares were sold short. We can Assume they were bought above current share price, because $DTC was on a downward trend until recently. So right now they have to buy back the shares they borrowed in order to realize their profits. (increased demand)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s7uw80c4yz391.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=176c22d56d68437b78fad3bc807048557fbbd4ed

As of the latest official SEC filing 3.21 million shares of $DTC were sold short. $DTC\`s share price was in free fall since IPO, but recent developments point to a trend reversal, this offers a great entry point as short seller who close their position significantly drive up the share price.

&#x200B;

[See how the chart definitely broke through the yellow trend line - This can be seen as very bullish and a great entry point.](https://preview.redd.it/48wgrnh5yz391.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5aae16ce89d51d4e2b113a6b0e6ac127d985c492)

The recent trend reversal puts pressure on SHF because their profits are melting. This means that up to 3.21million shares need to be bought in order to close out existing short positions.

Ortex, fintel Bloomberg etc. all have diffrent numbers for DTC\`s short interest because they messed up the count of institutional ownership. My observations clearly show a very tiny float with great bullish implications. (Very tiny supply.)

Oh Wednesday and Thursday a Volume of 81k and 116k respectively changed the share price by 3.4% and 3.7%. This points to an illiquid flow and is another indicator for a small float.

So if just a 80k-100k move the price by so much, can you imagine how much the price would move by 3.21m shares? Even better, because $DTC has a very low avr. Daily Volume, of ≈ 600k shares, it will take several days for to get out of their obligations. As of now they are trying to double down and delay the inevitable - This tactic was commonly observed at other low liquidity short plays, but always fails at some point.

&#x200B;

[Solo Stove™ made by Solo Brands.](https://preview.redd.it/v07zo0i7yz391.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a9f757f0f672f2b777a86c68edaee15d681a8c6)

Last but not least we have **485k Failure-to-deliver (FTD\`s)** on May 13th which is a bullish sign as well.

FTD\`s are shares that were bought, but not yet delivered by Market Makers. They have to be bought 35 days after the FTD-date. Next FTD data will be released at 15th of June, so we don't know if even more shares have to be recouped by Market Makers.

# Let me Sum it up - The perfect Storm is brewing. (TLDR)

**$DTC** has a **sustainable and scalable business model,** has increased its revenue by 126% in the last year and is Year-over-Year profitable. Independent analysts **expect $70m in earnings 2022** and beat their last two quarterly earnings estimations. We have **institutions buying up the free float** for months while keeping the share price low, in order to accumulate as much as possible. Look at current filings, it indicates, that they are **very few freely tradable shares available**. Leaving almost nothing on the Table for the public and short sellers. (Low Supply)

At the same time we have short sellers that have to buy back shares in order to profit, therefore hiking the share price and increasing demand. They find themselves at the point of trend reversal and due to low daily volume need **5-6 days to cover** their short positions. At some point those shares have to be bought back in order to realize profits and with sustainable growth year by year it is possible that $DTC saw its All-Time-Low recently. 

Thanks to the low share price and $DTC\`s profitability, the downside risk is quite managable right now, we have **88.8% positive Call option Volume** and a **nice gamma set** up is crystallizing.

Market Makers have to get at least **485k FTD\`s** from the free Market and most importantly, we have a huge army of **capable retail trader**, who know how to take advantage of Market Mechanics, that were used against them for decades. Because of Solo Brands ($DTC) recent run up many retail traders are on notice, the stock got a lot of positive news coverage, which is the best form of free advertisement.

As this DD is already far too long, nobody will ever reach this sentence, so I won't go into a technical chart-analysis, but I will shortly point out, that a breakup of a negative trend channel offers a great opportunity to enter, as a long lasting trend reversal seems to be likely.

**Full Disclosure:** I am long with 5k shares and some options. Always do your own research before investing and know your risk tolerance.

# The future

Meteorologists can now forecast the weather 5-days out with an accuracy of 90%. Trying to forecast the weather 10 days out, and your accuracy rate falls to 43%

https://preview.redd.it/l9yq4w5w86491.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=76f32d8cc978c340a49dc2e97a8fad0177f687ae

  
I believe the future of the market, the economy, and business is as difficult to predict as the weather and this is why it's so hard for me to pay dear multiples for growth stocks. Because their share prices are based so heavily on things that happen more than 10 years down the road- you need to really “know"". I believe a good price to pay for a growth stock, in a company with an obvious competitive advantage or monopoly, must be worthy to generate a 7% yield on paper. This way, if the growth flops your downside is still semi-limited. 

  
I have been taking a look at Belgium Post. It looks similar to a growth-flop story (analysts paying too high multiples for “growth” they can’t accurately forecast). The weather changed, the growth stopped, and the growth investors left. They have left BPOST (Belgium Post) trading at a P/E of 4.64. EPS of 1.25 in 2021, at a share price of 5.8EUR. Annual report [here](https://bpostgroup.com/sites/default/files/2022-04/bpost%20annual%20report%202021_EN_FIN.pdf)

Opportunity is often found where nobody else is looking. Do yourself a favor and Google Search ""Belgium Post"". Absolutely no coverage on it. BIG F\*$CING TICK BOX right there chaps. 

  
This is the story:

* 2016 to 2017 Revenue grew at 23% through acquisition. Share price very happy- I believe investors forecasting continued growth.
* 2017 to 2018 more growth- 27% Organic!! Growth investors are ecstatic…(But payroll costs rose a lot, and operating margin dropped).
* 2018-2019 no growth. On **13 March 2018,** they release an annual report. From that day share price goes from 27EUR to 7.63EUR. 72% Decrease in less than a year!! (Sucks to pay dear for growth). Payroll up. Operating margin down. 
* 2019 -2020. Revenue grows at 9.9% company changes dividend policy to a more conservative policy (30-50% IFRS profit - see image attached). 
* 2021-2022 Revenue growth stabilizes at 4.4%. Payroll is still high (probably the biggest risk).

30% dividend on 1.25EUR EPS (2021) is 6.5%. This is in the lower range.  
I would still like to dig through every filing to get a better feel for it, but I have a good feeling from this brief overview.

  
Risks: 1) Their parcel business is big. What happens when consumers feel the pinch and stop spending? (My risk for everything at the moment). 2) Payroll costs? Can they keep up with Belgium’s payroll increases? I remember we spoke about the need to raise prices every so-and-so year… 3) What is the consensus from the consumer on the ground in Belgium regarding Bpost’s service? Is there a better competitor?

Still, the stock has been de-risked. The ""growth investors"" have given up, leaving this for dead. Leaving me to pick it up at bargain prices.

For those degens on here, I plead. stop throwing your money down the drain. Bet on surer things. If you want to REALLY BET. Then just option up and go big. But this is not advice.

I think I answered my own question. As Low paying subscribers suddenly start seeing ads on shows that originally did not have ads they will go to Disney or AMC + Last quarter they saw a slight increase in revenue but Im betting adding ads will only cost them more subscribers, I think I can wait until their stock is worth $100/share before going in. Thats my assessment but what do you think? Am I missing something?  I believe based on the decline of customers that their stock will collapse even more, the expected 20% increase from ads will cost them more subscribers than the revenue they will generate from the ads.",2022-06-08 09:26:44
1327,SEC unveils plan to overhaul stock trading due to GME/AMC run last year. Looks like it could kill commission free trading.,"Link to the story: https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/wall-street-regulator-spell-out-push-overhaul-stock-trading-sources-2022-06-08/

After the GME/AMC run last year the SEC has decided to overhaul PFOF. This is how companies like RobinHood, TDAmeritrade and Etrade are able to offer commission free trading. In a nutshell, they intend to shut it down.

Out of one corner of their mouth they are claiming it is for our own good, that our orders are not being fulfilled at the best price because they are able to go to wholesale brokers directly rather than putting them up for auction. This allows them to make a fractional cent of money off each trade, which adds up enough to allow them to offer commission free trading.

Out of the other corner of their mouth I am hearing that this could put commission free trading out of reach, shutting down the entire business model that allow it to exist. This would drastically tamp down on retail's ability to trade so much, which could make the markets less volatile.

Really not sure how to interpret it so I ask some of you all who know better what the true intentions are. My interpretation is that it is intended to shut us down to prevent something like GME from ever happening again. And ""unintentionally"" keeps the status quo on wall street so us filthy plebs stop mucking it all up for the upper crust. For the good of all of us.",2022-06-08 13:20:36
1328,Thoughts on fundamental tech stocks?,"So I work at the intersection of capital markets and technology. I'm not in IB or anything; I engineer financial software. So maybe I have a bit of a bias here, but I've been following ""blue chip"" tech stocks this past cycle. I'm specifically referring to the companies that offer hardware or services that the economy can't function without. Like servers or cybersecurity tools. My biggest gainers this quarter have been trades around the earnings of CRWD, SPLK, and HPE. 

I'm wondering what the thoughts are on how a recession would impact these kinds of companies? In my mind, a recession and/or inflation necessitates the savings that further investment in automation creates via productivity gains or lower costs via wages, etc. Also, changing geopolitics help justify spending if it improves security. 

Risks are obviously silicon supply chain-related, as well as rising rates. The latter requires greater net value at the time of investment. The first is almost universal, so comparatively, I'm not sure how much greater the risk is compared to other industries.

1331,"Can anything be meaningfully deduced from BTC + Tesla still being ""high"" in terms of retail sentiment?","1. Tesla is still +13% past 12 months with a 94x P/E and a market cap of $720b (this topic has been done to death; we don't need to get into it. They're an awesome company, their future growth story is amazing, their historical growth and returns are aw-inspiring, but these levels to me personally show that... retail has not pulled their money yet. I don't have data on who/what is propping Tesla up price wise, but I think it's fair to say it's very close to GME/AMC memestock levels valuation wise. However, institutional ownership is about 42% (if that report is accurate/means anything) but I'm sure a portion of that is because it's in a lot of S&P500 ETFs). Should they be worth more than every automaker combined, when we're about to enter a period of time of stagflation (GDP gonna go down because inflation eating into earnings/savings of regular Joe's who no longer can afford to finance a $40k-$60k Tesla)

2. BTC/USD is still $28k-$30k and has been holding that level for about a full month now. Crypto probably has a place in the future, but the BTC technology and all of its layers are probably not going to remain dominant for the next 5 years, let alone 50. Crypto isn't really being used at large scale for things like... paying for groceries/gas/ordering food/buying stuff online. Does a small subset of people use it for random stuff? Yeah. Do they do it almost exclusively inside of heavily regulated exchanges? Pretty much. This alone tells me it isn't as good as a credit card for transactions and it isn't unregulated or decentralized or anonymous like original crypto claims. Why anybody is still FOMOing/holding on... I don't know. I believe they deserve to be ""shaken out"" (punished) for gambling, hoping an asset like Bitcoin makes them money despite not bringing any real value to the world (arguably, being a mild contributor to climate change due to all of the computational power used). Is crypto really a net positive on society right now? has it been past 12-36 months? If not, why is it worth $30k? It shouldn't be.

When we see BTC $20k-$25k or lower and TSLA down another 20% (13% to give up the gains for the past 12 months it has held onto, and 7-8% more to match what the S&P has done so far), I think I'll feel better about the stock market.

I could 100% be wrong and BTC could got to $100k and Tesla is going to do a 3:1 split and run up another 1000%. I just don't think those two things are founded on any sound fundamentals, that's all. And because of that, I don't think ""max pain"" has hit the market yet. There hasn't been a ""flush"" where the little guy gets wiped out (like picking Dotcom stocks back in 2000) and evil hedge fun Wall Street prevails/captures all of their money like a Vegas casino.",2022-06-11 17:47:24

1333,Gamestop And AMC Shares Fluctuate Amongst Volatile Market With An Impending Short Squeeze Predicted,"Last year GME and AMC shares alarmed the market as a slew of retail investors banded together to make trades on the stock across online chatrooms, creating sizable short squeezes. The movements caused several damaging issues within hedge funds and other short-sellers as the move went against market predictions.

Last month, the market saw a glimpse of what that looked like last year as shares in GameStop rose 30% at one point, and AMC Entertainment shares gained more than 20%. At the end of a [p](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/05/gamestopgamestonk-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-madness-of-crowds/?sh=182ae77c25d0)articularly volatile day of trading in May, both stocks rose 10.1% and 8% respectively.

Regardless of the day’s movements, both stocks are noticeably off their high positions from the early portion of 2021.

GameStop, which climbed as high as $483 per share last January, on an intraday basis, concluded at $89.57 per share after the surge last month. AMC, which was at an intraday high of $72.62 in June 2021, closed at $11.20 per share.

One ticker that some traders have looked at to also have short squeeze potential is Regencell Bioscience Ltd ($RGC).

The short volume ratio has a similar pattern to that of GameStop with both averaging over 40% in the past year. In fact, Regencell has sometimes been more heavily shorted than GameStop, with occasional days close to 90% shorted.

Although Regencell and GameStop stocks’ short volume profiles might be considered to be similar, not as much is known about Regencell. As of May 16, the company’s founder and CEO held 10,539,159 ordinary shares, representing 81% of the total number of issued and outstanding ordinary shares in Regencell.

Regencell’s total cumulative short volume is over 19 million shares, while the total outstanding shares less CEO and Chairman’s shares is only approximately 2.4 million, yet Regencell is still trading over 300% its IPO price.

1336,Some Key Lessons From Seth Klarman's Recent HBS 2022 Interview That May Help You With Value Investing,"Recently, one of my favorite value investors, Seth Klarman, spoke in an interview with Harvard Business School (I will link once I find something reliable they seem to be striking the youtube videos down). If you are able to find the interview, it is definitely worth the watch. You can see how cool and calm he views the markets as well as the businesses which he owns. Klarman gave some of his ideas surrounding investor psychology: “*A very significant part of my philosophy has to do with managing your psychology. Markets are about the psychology of others. When are they panicking? When are they greedy? But you have those same flaws or those same potential flaws, and managing your portfolio in a way that doesn't leave you where you're panicking or overexposed to greed. If you can rule those extremes out, you'll navigate the markets well.*” I will take a look at 3 key points that I got from his interview and just tack on some takeaways. I am hoping that others can relate as well as add or contrast these points so we as a sub can work through different ideas!

If you would like to see this in video form you can view my Youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BzVd9GLGv8).

**Market Inefficiencies**

>“*Two things happen in markets; right markets are inefficient partly because of human nature, as I mentioned; greed and fear. People get greedy and panic; in some cases, the panic is legitimate. ""Oh crap, I leveraged my portfolio, and I'm getting a margin call."" or ""I have short-term clients, and they can redeem, and I'm getting redeemed, and I have to sell whether I like it or not."" There are other constraints on investors that also create inefficiencies. Once in a while, we get a call from someone with one asset in their private equity fund who want to raise the next fund. They want to book a gain on that asset. And so, call it the last asset phenomenon. People literally will sell that more urgently, and maybe they'll favor getting it done over the exact price they get because they want to raise their next fund and move on. They want to book a game and get paid. We live in an imperfect world, and their clients should probably not love that, but maybe their clients would love it. The manager has a lot of things to balance, so that's just one little example. When a bond gets downgraded, there's always an immediate rush to the exits by the investment-grade holders. A bond gets downgraded to junk, say when the bond goes literally from BBB to BB. Many bonds have to get sold; some are probably sold in advance. It's good to know what a company does, its operations, and its worth. It's also interesting to know that there's a very large seller, and the bonds are 20 points lower. With essentially no change in any information, just the rating of a 26 year old at moody's. So those are the kinds of things that can trigger our interest then we do fundamental work*”

The important thing to remember from this quote is that inefficiencies can be driven by greed and fear. We saw the fear come in March 2020 when the world’s economy came to a grinding halt and that was followed by an insane greed cycle where people were trying to get the next AMC or Gamestop to the moon. You are seeing funds like Three Arrows Capital or Bill Hwang’s fund blow up due to taking out insane amounts of leverage to continue to buy into the hype. Klarman gives some further examples with the asset from the private equity fund where a fund may be trying to just simply get rid of an asset to get to the next round of funding which leads to it being sold possibly at a cheaper price than its true intrinsic value. Next, he points to how bonds may get downgraded just due to an individual’s rating change when in reality the underlying fundamentals of the business may not have changed. This can lead to a bond being sold off due to it moving below investment grade or a certain rating that a fund may need to keep within its portfolio. The key is to try to find these inefficiencies by researching companies and keeping potential opportunities on your radar. This is why I have companies and opportunities on my watch list that I have price alerts on once they start to hit where my margin of safety begins. In the short term, you want the sales to continue so you can keep adding to your position at lower and lower prices assuming fundamentals remain intact.

**The Silo Effect**

>“*We dig very deep, our approach is,let's look a mile wide, let's look at everything that we can possibly figure out and then we find something that seems like it might be a bargain and inefficient pricing then we go a mile deep. Gillian Ted of the Financial Times wrote a book called The Silo Effect and she talks about the good things and the bad things when that soil you when you just know a certain kind of company or you only know 20 stocks well. The problem is that that's the hammer and nail problem. You know those things really well but you don't know anything about anything else, you have no perspective to say well this is the best of those biotech stocks that I look at but maybe even the best of them is not nearly as good as those stocks over there. The silo effect hamstrings investors. One way to describe how we think about our portfolio is that we look between the silos. We look for cracks and the things leaking out. We look for things that can't be easily siloed, there are fewer competitors in those and if there’s one thing I love it's the lack of competition.*”

The key point on silos is that just because it is the best opportunity in the silo, does not mean that it is the best opportunity in the market or within your circle of competence. Klarman points to the hammer and nail problem which Maslow stated,  “if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.” If an analyst within a fund or investment bank strictly focuses on one industry, such as electric vehicles, they will think that a company is a better buy when compared to other high-flying EV companies, but in reality, it is still too highly valued relative to other opportunities. Klarman goes on to say that putting yourself in a box can hamper you and your investment journey. His fund likes to look at things that may be overlooked or that are not in a silo because the lack of eyes on that opportunity will allow him to find opportunities with an ample margin of safety. The key takeaway here is that you do not beholden yourself to one simple box, but find out where the edge of your circle of competence is to make sure you are looking at all potential opportunities.

**Risk Vs. Volatility**

>""*If you don't think about every investment as having a margin of safety….This means you buy at a discount and leave room for error, misjudgment, and bad luck because things happen in the world and happen in investing. I think in Warren Buffett's Parlance, he says, ""when you build a bridge, you might plan to be driving, you know a certain kind of truck over it, but you build it so it can handle five times as much weight as that just in case,"" and that's what you should do with investments, so you never lose sight of the downside. When other people buy a very flashy growth stock at a very high multiple, we're probably looking for a more sedate investment that will make less or maybe won't make less and will protect the downside in the heat of the last couple of years that saw stocks rocket to new highs almost every day…We feel our investments are completely solid, so I think that it's not to choose one or the other it's always to remember both getting your capital back and trying to make a return. If I had to choose one of those, I'd always choose to get your capital back because you live to play another day, and losing money is a real challenge because it can be very hard to make it back.… You may get margin calls or other debt coming due, so you always want to be thinking about not blowing up and not getting too far over your skis….When you focus on return at the exclusion of risk, you try to take more risk to get the return; you get the risk but may or may not get the return. If you focus first on the risk and mitigate or avoid or reduce the risk, then you've protected the downside, and then maybe you get the return*.""

Klarman and many other value investors have the same view as is stated in the quote above. If the market suddenly values the company at the half and your research/analysis still checks out it is a buying opportunity. Buying into a company with a margin of safety allows you to own a business with room for error so that you do not get any random surprises that you may have initially missed. As Buffet would say “the first rule of investment is don’t lose \[money\]. And the second rule of investment is don’t forget the first rule. And that’s all the rules there are.” The ultimate goal is to focus on the downside risks first and the returns will eventually come. This will allow you to continue investing in businesses while growing your capital for new opportunities. Also, the risk is related to the business that you own and what you are paying for that business while volatility is simply the stock chart going up and down in the short term. Looking at risk this way allows you to ignore the noise of seeing analyst 12-month price predictions or downgrades/upgrades in the near term. You are not picking a random name, but investing in a business and you are a business owner. Many people think that higher risk equals a higher return, which is true in some regards, but it is better to find low-risk high-return opportunities. 

Ultimately, the goal of value investing is to allow for the compounding of wealth over time. Klarman points out how ""Warren Buffett never tried to make the most money. He never tried to get rich quickly. He tried to get rich slow, and I feel like that's what value investing is; it's a philosophy that stays away from the hot flashy trendy investments and focuses more on never losing big."" This is an important point to remember when your neighbor gets a 2x on a stock that is the next Tesla and you are getting a 20% YoY return, you may begin to feel envy. This envy will lead you to poor judgment and buying companies your old process wouldn’t have allowed you to buy. At the end of the day, you will need to continue learning through success and failures.

Stocks finished a choppy session higher on Friday as equities closed out the worst start to the year in 52 years. The move lower comes following a mixed set of economic results this week, which offer some evidence that, while still elevated, there are small signs that inflation is softening. 

West Texas intermediate crude oil futures rose back above $108 per barrel after logging the first monthly decline since November 2021 in June. And the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 2.9%, declining sharply from a more than decade-high of nearly 3.5% reached in mid-June.

Early in the morning, S&P Global's final manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for June was revised up to 52.7, which was still the lowest since July 2020, but better than the 52.4 previously reported for the month.

On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that core personal expenditures - the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation - decelerated slightly in May but remains well above the Fed’s target. Core PCE,  the value of the goods and services purchased by people in the US, rose by 4.7% over last year compared to the 4.8% increase anticipated, according to Bloomberg data. Headline inflation, which includes energy and food price changes, also rose slightly less than expected, or at a 6.3% annual rate to match April's pace. However, separate data showed real personal spending fell by a larger-than-expected 0.4% in May after a rise of 0.7% in April, suggesting consumers were pulling back on some spending with inflation at current levels. [Here is the PCE report](https://www.bea.gov/news/2022/personal-income-and-outlays-may-2022#:~:text=Personal%20consumption%20expenditures%20(PCE)%20is,and%20personal%20current%20transfer%20payments.).

In response to elevated prices, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed the central bank’s commitment to fighting inflation, suggesting that this aim will take priority over fully preserving activity elsewhere in the economy. During the European Central Bank’s annual economic policy meeting, Powell said “Is there a risk we would go too far \[regarding interest rate hikes\]. The bigger mistake to make - let’s put it that way - would be to fail to restore price stability.” Earlier in the month, Powell suggested either a 50 or 75 basis point interest rate hike would most likely be on the table following the Fed's July meeting. And in the weeks since, a number of other key central bank officials have affirmed this stance. In my opinion, I think we will see another 75 basis point hike. 

**Highlights**

* GM, which lost its crown as the U.S. sales leader last year for the first time since 1931 to Toyota, said it sold 582,401 vehicles in the quarter vs 531.105 by Toyota. Both figures are down 15 and 22% year-to-date respectively

**Market Recap** 

Following an extended weekend, US stocks rebounded from lows in the morning to finish solidly in the green, even as concerns over inflation and a potential persist and market participants look ahead to a week chock full of economic data. Energy prices also came under renewed pressure, with West Texas intermediate crude oil futures dipping below $100 per barrel and posting its largest decline since March at session lows. Treasury yields extended last week's slide, and the benchmark 10-year yield fell below 2.9%.

The S&P 500 has so far posted its worst start to a year since 1970, and the Dow since 1962, with each of the major averages sliding by double-digit percentages year-to-date and over 20% since previous highs.  The U.S. economy has recently shown some signs of softening, with consumer confidence sliding and short-term expectations[ sinking to a near decade-low](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-confidence-conference-board-june-2022-143536146.html) in addition to [spending falling for the first time this year in May.](https://www.yahoo.com/now/us-consumer-spending-softens-prices-124209114.html)

Concerns over inflation and the potential that higher prices may catalyze a recession have continued to weigh on equities all year. Federal Reserve officials continue to maintain a hawkish stance, suggesting further aggressive tightening is coming and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in remarks last week that there was “no guarantee” the Fed could avoid a recession while attempting to fight inflation. While bounces like today are encouraging, remember one day does not make a trend. 

Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said “Last week's data performance, including a downward revision to Q1 GDP and evidence of sustained deceleration in consumer spending, suggests the U.S. economy is clearly losing momentum in the face of soaring inflation and tightening financial conditions.” 

urther critical economic data is due out this week, including FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday and the June job report, which give us a clearer picture of the labor market amid higher prices. Economists are looking for 275,000 jobs to have come back in June, which would mark a sharp slowdown from the prior month's 390,000. And the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.6%, for just a tick above February 2020's pre-pandemic low of 3.5%. 

Bullard added, “The current hawkish tone should be pervasive throughout following the actions of a stepped-up 75 basis point federal funds rate hike and the explicit commitment to continue tightening aggressively until officials see 'clear and convincing' signs that inflation is coming down to target. We will be on the lookout for clues as to what inflation evidence officials are monitoring to help make that call.""

Last week, the Commerce Department reported that core personal expenditures - the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation - decelerated slightly in May but remained well above the Fed’s target. Core PCE,  the value of the goods and services purchased by people in the US, rose by 4.7% over last year compared to the 4.8% increase anticipated, according to Bloomberg data.

**Market Recap** 

Stocks pushed higher Wednesday after a very choppy session following the release of the Federal Reserve’s June meeting minutes, which highlighted the risk presented by elevated inflation and a commitment by the Fed to remain aggressive in its fight against higher prices. The price of crude oil remained under $100 per barrel amid fears that a recession would weigh on demand while the benchmark 10-year treasury yield fell to 2.82%, the lowest level in six weeks.

Prospects of a deep economic downturn have stoked ongoing volatility in markets, with investors weighing whether inflation and a more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening cycle will curb growth to the point of tipping the economy into a recession. And some key economic data, from consumer sentiment to spending and purchasing managers' indices, have each softened or turned lower in recent prints.

After trading choppily all morning, stocks pushed higher in the afternoon after the release of the Fed’s meeting minutes, which reaffirmed the Fed’s commitment to aggressively fighting inflation. The minutes said, “Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy. and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist.""

Moreover, the Fed all but confirmed another 75 basis point hike to the interest rate in the next FOMC meeting. The minutes said, “After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings.”

Early on Wednesday, new data painted a mixed picture on the current state of the economy. [Job openings](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm) came in greater-than-expected at nearly 11.3 million for May, pointing to persistent tightness in the labor market and ongoing labor scarcities relative to vacancies. Separately, the [Institute for Supply Management's closely watched services index](https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-report-on-business/services/june/) dipped to the lowest level since May 2020 as of June.

Jonathan Miller, senior analyst at Barclays, said “A broad-based slowdown in overall consumer spending has already been underway this year, led by deterioration in the goods category, with services providing little in the way of offset. may indicate that a more precautionary mindset might be setting in, which would make households more inclined to hoard excess savings accumulated during the pandemic.""

“Too often, sophisticated hedge funds have used short selling and complex derivatives to take  advantage of small investors. They will short a company, conduct a negative publicity campaign to  drive the stock price down temporarily and cash out, then do it all over again many times. The term  for this, as you may be aware, is ‘short & distort,’” Elon Musk wrote in his email exchange to CNBC.

As witnessed on Reddit and other social media and forums, especially during the GME short squeeze,  retail shareholders came together, driven by the community’s effort to punish market participants  who make a living shorting and distorting public companies, causing them to stumble and fall.

## Founder & CEO’s Conviction Of A Better And Brighter Future

When insiders (and in the case of RGC, its CEO) have consistently bought shares of the company, it  demonstrates their confidence and belief in the company.

Since the listing of RGC on Nasdaq on 16 July 2021, RGC’s CEO has purchased over $5 million of ordinary shares and has not sold any shares. Such percentage of shareholding also gives confidence  to investors and potential [investors](https://www.valuewalk.com/yield-starved-investors-should-be-exploring-less-traditional-opportunities/) alike as it is apparent the CEO is confident about the future of the  company.

The CEO is literally putting his money where his mouth is and he will continue to use his personal funds  to purchase company shares to demonstrate his commitment and confidence to the Company and his  position against short and distort sellers. To date, the CEO:-

1. Has personally funded the company and did not pay himself back after IPO;

* RGC’s CEO has continuously funded the Company since its incorporation up to the IPO without bank borrowing.
* He converted his shareholders’ loan of $3.25 million to RGC’s ordinary shares upon listing.

1. Is a listed company CEO who does not draw a salary and bonus; and

* Of the 6,296 US-listed companies in 1Q 2022 (as published by Statista) and with reference to CEO share purchases data available on MarketBeat.com, RGC’s CEO is probably the only CEO who does not draw a salary and bonus, reserved share options for all employees  except himself and had continuously purchased more than $5 million worth of his  company’s shares.

## Strong Shareholder Support

Short sellers may not have noticed or have overlooked this important shareholder composition. The  company is backed by strong shareholders, e.g., Samuel Chen and Fiona Chang, directors and  shareholders of Digital Mobile Ventures Ltd.

Samuel Chen was very successful alongside Li Ka-shing from his early investment in Zoom. He owned  8.8% of the total voting power in Zoom post-IPO and Zoom’s market capitalization peaked at US$161 billion on 19 October 2020.

Based on Schedule 13G filing with the SEC on 15 December 2021, Digital Mobile Ventures Ltd. is the  second largest shareholder in RGC, holding approximately 7.63% of the total outstanding shares.

## Recent News

Following the announcement on 16 February 2022 of its investigational liquid-formula RGC-COV19TM showing effectiveness in eliminating mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms within a 6-day treatment

period through the Company’s EARTH efficacy trial, the Company has recently announced on 18 May  2022 that its additional efficacy trial corroborated the data of the first efficacy trial. In delivering  natural treatment that are safe and effective, the company is clearly in the right direction to save and  improve lives of patients, which result in a positive impact and benefit to the people around them as  well.

The company also recently announced that all directors and employees who were previously granted  stock options upon the Company’s IPO have agreed to a further lock-up undertaking for a period of six months after their stock options become vested; as their stock options are set to vest on 16 July 2022, their shares will remain locked up until 16 January 2023.

## Recession-Resistant Stock

When the economy heads toward a [recession](https://www.valuewalk.com/recession-in-the-us-already-started-peter-schiff-says/), it is natural for investors to worry about falling stock  prices and its impact on their portfolios, and look towards recession-resistant stocks. During economic  downturn like what we are experiencing now, smart money rotates into sectors that are less sensitive  to the economic cycle, like healthcare, which have historically fared well during recessions. The simple  reason is that health is always a priority and nothing else is more important.

RGC CEO is a strong shareholder and will continue to invest in the company with the goal of saving  and improving the lives of patients, especially children.

**Philanthropic project - helping people in need.**

Regencell Foundation is a private philanthropic foundation established by RGC’s CEO in 2017. He is  currently spearheading a philanthropic project to provide grants to over 10,000 children afflicted with  ADHD, ASD, COVID-19 and those in severe financial conditions. RGC’s CEO started providing grants on  16 April 2022 and has helped over 150 children. Interested persons may see the company’s links below.

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.51%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.22%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.73%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.09%

* AMC Entertainment (AMC): -2.89%

**Market Summary**

Stocks finished modestly lower in a choppy session as investors digested the latest consumer price index (CPI) numbers, which showed inflation has continued to accelerate from already elevated levels to over 9% year-over-year. Treasury yields were also in focus, with sharp moves happening at the front end of the yield curve. The 10-year rose as high as 3.04% following the CPI print before retreating, with 2-year yields rising as much as 3.17%, prompting a further inversion. The yield curve “inverts” when yields on shorter-dated Treasuries rise above those of longer-dated ones and have [typically preceded recessions on Wall Street](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yield-curve-inverts-april-2022-200829124.html).

Meanwhile in currency markets, the euro fell below parity — or a 1:1 value — with the dollar early Wednesday, the first time in over twenty years. 

In the US, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed headline inflation rose a whooping 9.1% year-over-year, another drastic acceleration from the already-elevated 8.6% reported last month and higher than estimates of 8.8%. “Core” CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components, rose 5.9% in June, compared to 6.0% in May. Economists expected a 5.7% increase in this measure.

These figures confirm another 75 basis point hike to the interest rate at the conclusion of the July 27 policy meeting, with some even speculating the Fed may be forced to consider a dramatic 100 basis point hike. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said “Overall, this report confirms that the Fed will need to hike by 75bp again at the end-July meeting. While some will draw parallels with the shockingly bad May CPI report, the backdrop is markedly different — commodity prices have fallen sharply and we’ve seen clearer signs of an economic slowdown, both of which will contribute to weaker price pressures ahead.""

In addition to the CPI print, market participants digested the start of a new earnings season. 

Delta Air Lines ([DAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAL/)) [reported earnings that missed expectations on Wednesday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-q2-earnings-airlines-massive-surge-travel-105709221.html) morning as higher costs bit the airline currently battling with excess demand and constrained capacity. Shares of Delta fell 4.7%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) are among the big banks to follow suit Thursday and Friday.

**Highlights**

* Notorious short-seller Hindenburg Research said it had taken up a long position on Twitter shares. ""We have accumulated a significant long position in shares of Twitter. Twitter's complaint poses a credible threat to Musk's empire,"" Hindenburg said in a tweet.
* Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman told investors Monday he would return $4 billion raised by the SPAC he launched in 2020.
* Peloton will stop making its own equipment as the company pivots focus from selling hardware to selling subscriptions. Taiwanese company Rexon Industrial will become the primary manufacturer of the bikes. 
* Kathaleen McCormick will oversee Twitter’s (TWTR) lawsuit against Tesla CEO Elon Musk after he pulled out of the deal to acquire the social media company for $44 billion.
* Netflix (NFLX) announced Microsoft (MSFT) as its partner ofr its ads-supported service, which the company will employ following last quarter’s disastrous results. 
* Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Day sales generated $6 billion in sales, up 7.8% from last year, making it the biggest U.S. online shopping day of 2022 so far.
* Alphabet Inc.’s Google plans to slow hiring for the remainder of the year in the face of a potential economic recession, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Tuesday in an email to staff.

1346,"Solo Brands $DTC offers a great opportunity. The current set up is aligning perfectly for a good price action at Aug Q2 earnings Call. I try to explain everything in detail in this DD, feedback appreciated!","# Hi there,

In this DD, I will try to methodically point out, why $DTC is coming closer and closer to a really big bounce and which indicator are pointing to this outcome right now. The stock market isn't a pure guessing game and I hope you take the time to listen to my theory and I appreciate any constructive feedback.

So in the past 6 month $DTC\`s share price was falling over 75%, into heavily undervalued territory. As typical with the market, it usually overreacts to the downside, before it overreacts to the upside.

[Since IPO we saw a falling knife until mid May, when the CEO and CFO bough 140k shares and the chart made a technical trend reversal.](https://preview.redd.it/mmazqnrlnlb91.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a45822bca60b3388009c169b7d567d35f570b6d)

In my opinion we are about to witness the upside overreaction. First of all, we were able to reliably stop the downward trend and consolidated for two month now. In this time an upwards trend channel developed, which is a good indicator.

Another great thing happend, yesterday the official Short interest numbers by the Nyse were released. They showed us, that from the 15th of June to the 30th of Jun over 500k new short positions were opened. From 2.6M SI to 3.1M SI . 500k shares sold short are a huge amount, considering the avr. daily volume is only slightly above 500k, yet the share price further increased in that timeframe. From 3.80$ to 4.06$, this means shorts are desperately trying everything to keep $DTC down, because once it starts to spiral up, they will lose control and it will create a positive feedback loop, similiar to $rdbx, $bkkt or $sprt. The share price increase in this types of squeezes is related to exponential curves, at first slow, but with rapid acceleration. 

Ofc, I cannot predict the intensity of the upcoming run, no-one can tell if the share price will 3x or 10x, but as long as the share price steadily increases, there is no other possibility, but a nice big squeeze.

# Cant they just keep kicking the can down the road?

That's an excellent and often misunderstood question. In theory ofc they can keep the stock price low for a long time. But this type of manipulation is quite expensive for short seller and comes with an opportunity cost. So in DTC´s case it doesn't make sense, because the costs to manipulate are higher than the expected gains. The explanation therefor is a little complicated, but I will do my best to clarify one of the biggest misconceptions in retail.

If you have stocks, that already squeezed, like $GME $AMC, $RDBX for example, those stocks are highly overvalued in regard to their fundamental fair valuation. Because short sellers expect the stock price to reach the (lower) fair valuation in the future, they keep manipulating the stock for a while  until their respective stock reaches the lower share price. For example in case of $rdbx, they wait for the $CSSE merger, which puts the $rdbx shares in the penny range, for that matter they just keep doubling down, until their desired event happend.

Or if you look at $GME/$AMC, which are heavily manipulated from the first big squeezes onward. Shortseller expect the hype to slowly die down and bet on every subsequent squeeze to get lower and lower, therefor they close their short positions on each dip of those meme stocks and reopen their short positions whenever they are going to make another spike. 

Ofc there are many other scenarios in which it might be worth for shorts to keep a stock down in the long term, but as long as they dont close their positions they bleed money and dont cash in profits (in case the specific stock is below their shorting price)

In the case of $DTC we had no squeeze yet and shorts have massive unrealized gains at the moment, since their average short position was opened in the 7$ price range. However they did miss calculated $DTC\`s business model, by expecting $DTC to go bankrupt. Unfortunately for them the opposite happend and $DTC beat their earnings Call the past two times and Q2 went so well, that even the CEO and CFO bought over half a million dollar in shares end of May.

Now the best thing for shorts would be to slowly cover their positions and take nice profits home. But humans are greedy, the short seller are still hoping for some improbably event, that could tank $DTC and save their asses. Also, because of the ultra low volume they need over 5.44 Day to Cover all their short positions, so they keep shorting the stock against all odds.

This is great for us, as the same thing happened with $SPRT a few weeks before it took off, increasing short interest, together with increasing share price is the perfect recipe for a huge squeeze.

Mathematically there is no way for short seller to take a lot of profits, by closing out short positions, without shooting $DTC\`s share price into the sky. Once $DTC issues their next earnings call and appears on the radar of Wallstreet, heavy volume will kick in and the price is going to take off, forcing remaining short seller to buy back their shares or risk losing all their profits. Which either way will be good for us.

One last thing, unfortunately Ortex and Fintel both rely on the Data broker Capital IQ, who has calculated the wrong free float for $DTC, they come up with 14.7M shares, because they treat Class B shares same as Class A shares, this however is a big mistake. Therefore I recommend using S3 analystics or Bloomberg Terminal, who report the real SI % which lies at 35% To be sure I went through all the 13F ownership filings by myself and the real free float is 7.45M shares.

[Since May we made a stable upwards trend channel, the Current low point offers a great ](https://preview.redd.it/4pcmiw6lnlb91.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cd04cd3b262c22cc24be03085e0d514d6a6bf958)

In the current Trend channel every dip offers a great entry point until August earnings, when the bigger price action is to be expected.The management affirmed their 2022 guidance in May and expect a positive free cash flow:

***Guidance for Full Fiscal Year 2022***

**Total revenue** is expected to be between $540 million to $570 million.

**Adjusted EBITDA\*** is expectedto be between $121 million to $132 million.

I know I am writing about $DTC for 2 month now, but everything is lining up perfectly to explode in a few weeks, all I write is based on my opinion, however I put my money were my mouth is.",2022-07-14 18:25:43

# [S&P 500 futures slip after index hits 6-week high, Tesla shares to boost Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/20/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures dipped Thursday after a batch of mixed corporate earnings from companies. Tesla shares boosted Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 117 points, or 0.37%. S&P 500 futures ticked down 0.23%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.01%.
*****
> The moves come as Wall Street is enjoying a July rebound. All three major averages hit their highest levels in more than a month during Wednesday’s session, with the S&P 500 reaching its best closing level since June 9.
*****
> Tesla shares were choppy after the automaker reported stronger-than-expected earnings but shrinking automotive gross margins. As of 7:54 a.m. ET, the stock was up 2.6%.
*****
> American Airlines beat revenue expectations in the second quarter, and forecasted a profit in the third quarter, as consumers continue to travel even with higher prices. Shares fell more than 2% in premarket trading.
*****
> United Airlines reported that it returned to profitability during the second quarter, but results came in below expectations. The stock fell more than 6% in premarket trading.
*****
> Meanwhile, shares of Alcoa and CSX jumped in the premarket after the companies beat expectations.
*****
> Roughly 13% of S&P 500 have reported earnings for the second quarter. Of those companies, about two-thirds have beaten expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite jumped nearly 1.6% on Wednesday, its fourth positive session in five. The tech-heavy index is up about 3.9% for the week.
*****
> Meanwhile, the Dow and S&P 500 each rose for the third day in four. The blue-chip index is up nearly 1.9% for the week, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.5% thus far.
*****
> “The bulls seem to be coming back into the market now. We’ve seen pretty sharp rallies in tech, crypto and other risk assets over the past few days,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. “Which is notable to us, because in an economy with some pretty notable weakness in it, you’d expect to be seeing other parts of the market performing well. But the animal spirits are back, at least for now.”
*****
> In other corporate news, shares of Carnival dropped more than 10% after the cruise company announced that it was selling an additional $1 billion of stock.
*****
> On the data front, investors will also be watching initial jobless claims data, which has been trending upward in recent weeks.

1350,"Mustang Bio works with sick orphans. You can't short sick orphans, right?","Mustang Bio (NASDAQ: MBIO) is a great company within the Massachusetts biotech hub. They have a growing pipeline, most notably with St. Jude's Children's Hospital. Their work is growing, and the price right now is very low given the overall downtrend in biotech. 

I think the SEC is ok with companies shorting (possibly naked) because they don't really care about the companies being shorted (GME and AMC to name a couple). But what if the companies were different?

What if the company HELPED SICK/DYING ORPHANS. This is where those donations and charity go- companies willing to do the research. I think once retail investors make this connection, it could be a pump that finally gets protection from the SEC. You think they'll take money from charities? The public backlash could provide them the chance to look like the good guys, just for DOING THEIR JOBS. Or if they still don't care, idk bet on GILD an evil company but makes money off the sick. 

TLDR: MBIO helps orphans, would be cool to see that stock go waaaaaay up.",2022-07-21 21:45:04

1352,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 25, 2022"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 25, 2022**

*Sorry for the absence last week, decided to take a little break from writing the daily recap, but back now!*

Stocks finished a boring session mixed as market participants look ahead to the busiest week of the quarter for corporate earnings and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday. When the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was up 0.1%, the Dow gained 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was the laggard, falling some 0.4%.

The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up an impressive 7.5% and 4.8%, respectively, so far this month. Shares of meme stock darlings GameStop and AMC have jumped 17% and 14.5%, respectively, as traders embrace the risk-on backdrop. Even 2022 laggard Netflix has seen its stock rise 25% month to date, even after another lackluster earnings report on July 19.

That said, the specter of inflation and a potential recession remain elevated.  the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that headline inflation continues to accelerate from already elevated levels. The consumer price index (CPI) rose a whooping 9.1% year-over-year, another drastic acceleration from the already-elevated 8.6% reported last month and higher than estimates of 8.8%. “Core” CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components, rose 5.9% in June, compared to 6.0% in May. Economists expected a 5.7% increase in this measure.

These figures confirm another 75 basis point hike to the interest rate at the conclusion of the July 27 policy meeting, with some even speculating the Fed may be forced to consider a dramatic 100 basis point hike. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said “Overall, this report confirms that the Fed will need to hike by 75bp again at the end-July meeting. While some will draw parallels with the shockingly bad May CPI report, the backdrop is markedly different — commodity prices have fallen sharply and we’ve seen clearer signs of an economic slowdown, both of which will contribute to weaker price pressures ahead.""

Furthermore, this week's second quarter GDP print may show [growth contracted](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow#:~:text=The%20GDPNow%20model%20estimate%20for,1.5%20percent%20on%20July%2015.) once again to follow a 1.6% first quarter GDP drop. Two quarters of negative growth are generally indicative of a recession, and that would run counter to the upbeat tone currently playing out in markets.

In the coming days, quarterly results from over 150 companies in the S&P 500 are expected, with Wednesday's policy announcement from the Federal Reserve and Thursday's GDP data also expected to move markets. On Tuesday, headline earnings will include results from McDonald's (MCD), Alphabet (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT).

1353,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 26, 2022","**Psycho’s Market Recap - Tuesday, July 26, 2022**

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.18%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.97%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.75%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.64%
* Volatility Index (VIX): +5.69%
* Apple (AAPL): -0.91%
* Microsoft (MSFT): -2.75%
* Amazon (AMZN): -5.23%
* Walmart (WMT): -7.62%
* Gamestop (GME): -4.56%
* AMC Entertainment (AMC): -6.14%
* Shopify (SHOP): -13.38%
* Coinbase (COIN): -20.99%
* Sundial (SNDL): -19.30%

US stocks resumed their slide on Tuesday after Walmart’s (WMT) failed earnings and ahead of a rush of earnings for large technology companies and the Fed’s latest interest rate decision on Wednesday. The price of crude oil stayed steady under $100 per barrel while the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hovered around 2.80%

Shares of Walmart (WMT) fell over 7% after the retail giant [slashed its second quarter and full-year profit outlooks](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-warning-stock-price-recession-worries-205538127.html) late Monday, citing rampant inflation and a resulting pullback in consumer spending on discretionary items. This report dragged down other retailers such as Target (TGT), Costco (COST), Dollar General (DG), and Amazon (AMZN). 

CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement, “The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend, and while we’ve made good progress clearing hardline categories, apparel in Walmart U.S. is requiring more markdown dollars. We’re now anticipating more pressure on general merchandise in the back half; however, we’re encouraged by the start we’re seeing on school supplies in Walmart U.S.” 

Also weighing on sentiment was a disappointing report from General Motors (GM) early Tuesday that showed second-quarter results fell short of Wall Street estimates. The Detroit-based automaker saw its net income fall 40% from a year ago during the period and said it failed to deliver 95,000 vehicles due to part shortages. Shares fell nearly as much as 3%.

In economic news, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again [downgraded forecasts for global growth this year and warned of “gloomy and more uncertain” circumstances](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/imf-cuts-global-gdp-forecast-as-economic-outlook-grows-gloomy.html) amid the fastest pace of inflation in forty years. The organization now projects the global economy will grow by only 3.2% this year, a downgrade from the 3.6% it had previously forecast in April when it cut expectations for 2022 to 3.6% from 4.4%.

Federal Reserve officials also kicked off their two-day policy meeting Tuesday and are expected to raise interest rates another 75 basis points at its conclusion Wednesday afternoon. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver remarks at 2:30 p.m. ET shortly after the U.S. central bank’s policy decision comes out at 2:00 p.m. ET.

In earnings news, Microsoft (MSFT) reported earnings that missed expectations on both the top and bottom line. Shares roughly flat after-hours at the time of writing. 

* **Revenue:** $51.9 billion versus $52.4 billion expected
* **Earnings per share:** $2.23 versus $2.29 expected
* **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.4 billion versus $16.7 billion expected
* **Intelligent Cloud:** $20.9 billion versus $21.1 billion expected
* **More Personal Computing:** $14.4 billion versus $14.7 billion expected

Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) also reported earnings that missed Wall Street estimates after the closing bell on Tuesday, though shares popped roughly 2.5% after the release of the report. 

* **Earnings per share (EPS):** $1.21 vs $1.28 expected
* **Revenue**: $69.69 billion vs $69.9 billion expected
* **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.34 billion vs. $7.52 billion expected
* **Google Cloud revenue:** $6.28 billion vs. $6.41 billion expected,
* **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $12.21 billion vs $12.41 billion expected

**Highlights**

* Shopify's (SHOP) stock nosedived nearly 16% after the e-commerce giant said it was [laying off roughly 10% of its global workforce](https://news.shopify.com/changes-to-shopifys-team) after a hiring boom to meet pandemic demand for online shopping. ""It’s now clear that the bet didn’t pay off,"" CEO Tobi Lutke said in a statement. ""What we see now is the mix reverting to roughly where pre-Covid data would have suggested it should be at this point.""
* UBS (UBS) shares fell as much as 12% after the Swiss bank reported a smaller quarterly profit than analysts anticipated as market volatility weighed on investment banking revenues and the financial institution warned of a challenging second half of the year.
* Shares of Coinbase (COIN) collapsed 20% after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened an investigation to probe whether the company improperly let Americans trade digital assets online. 
* Tesla (TSLA) announced it was launching a new Shareholder Platform, which would allow investors to participate in events and receive other benefits, though details remain sparse. 
* : In an attempt to better compete with TikTok, Meta has introduced a new monetization feature that allows creators to use licensed music from popular artists in their Facebook videos and earn a share of in-stream ad revenue, according to a Meta Press Release.
* Meta will raise prices on Quest 2 headsets by $100, starting August 1 of this year
* The U.S. auto safety agency said Tuesday it was opening five investigations into more than 1.8 million Stellantis, Ford Motor and General Motors vehicles over stalling and other issues.

### In the News

In early July when Tesla (TSLA) stock was trading around $680, we looked at how options were pricing the upcoming month that included an earnings event. Tesla is a stock that has tended to move alot more than options are pricing when it gets moving (both higher and lower) over the past year.

>TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

That 15% move by end of July was pricing a bullish consensus of about $780 in the stock. With this move higher Tesla actually ended July at $890, +$110 above what options were pricing at the time.

After the move higher Tesla options are pricing about 10% for August, which would put the stock near $800 or $1000:

1355,(8/1) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading month August and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, August 1st, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures fall slightly to start August trading with market coming off best month since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/31/stock-futures-fall-slightly-to-start-august-trading-with-market-coming-off-best-month-since-2020.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell Monday following the market’s best month since 2020 as investors look ahead to another week of key earnings reports and economic data.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 22 points lower, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures shed around 0.2% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
> On Friday, all major indexes gained, posting winning weeks and capping off the best month of the year so far and then some. The Dow gained 6.7% in July, while the S&P 500 added 9.1%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 12.4% as investors rushed into the tech stocks beaten up the most during this bear market. For each index, July’s performances were the best since 2020.
*****
> “We are seeing a relief rally in the stock market, as pessimism reached extreme levels, and as longer-term interest rates have been coming back down,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> “We believe the rally will last until later in the summer, but as stock prices rebound and it becomes increasingly clear that we are headed for a more typical recession (e.g. one with higher unemployment and nominal GDP dropping close to zero or negative), markets will again have another selloff,” he added. “But until that time, enjoy the rally as it’s likely catching a lot of people off guard.”
*****
> This week, investors have more economic data and company earnings to digest. On Monday, companies such as Activision Blizzard, Devon Energy, Loews and more report earnings. Later in the week Uber, Caterpillar, Starbucks, Eli Lilly, Amgen and others also have scheduled reports.
*****
> In addition, the Friday nonfarm payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will give more insight into the strong labor market. So far this year, the solid growth of jobs has prompted economists to say the U.S. is currently not in a recession, even with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP.

1358,Is it possible somebody is trying to rip me off?,"About 6 weeks ago I got a text from a girl who had dialed the wrong number. For whatever reason I decided to keep talking to this girl, she was cool, just happens to be cute as well. She is from China, here on a worker's visa, but lives in New York City. I'm in Utah. We've talked about all sorts of things, and we send each other pictures and selfies almost every day. 

When we started talking to each other about what we do for a living, she had told me she is in to finance, and she uses MetaTrader5. Specifically XAUUD. She almost trades exclusively with gold. She's tried to help me use it, and set me up with a demo account and everything. She wants me to screenshot her everything then she tells me what to do (I didn't screenshot my password or anything). I've decided to just watch some YouTube videos on how to use MetaTrader. 

She says that her Uncle, who has lived in San Francisco for about 10 years helps her on MetaTrader. Like she'll tell me how she gets on the market and her Uncle tells her when to trade and stuff like that. She seems VERY willing to teach me how to use MetaTrader. I've thought of saving up $1000 dollars and seeing what I can do with it. She set me up a demo account for 100,000 dollars.

Here's the rub: The other night she was talking how she had a bad night, she ONLY made 39k in one night. So then I'm like... ""Wait, so you're saying whenever you and your uncle get on the market you guys are making 5 figures?"" She tells me how she has made 130k in one night. Now I'm starting to wonder if this girl is trying to scam me somehow. I mean it can't be THAT easy to make that amount of money like that... I mean is she involved with insider trading? IDK, I obviously don't know anything about the market, and that's why I've come here to ask you guys cause you'll give it to me straight. The reason I came to this sub is because I was interested in the Gamestop/AMC stock that was artificially inflated for a short time.

I mean I met this girl PURELY by chance, and she didn't getting ""very willing to help"" me with trading until we had been talking for a few weeks any way. She hasn't asked me to send her money or anything, and I know that she isn't sending me pics of someone else because of the nature of the pictures we send each other, but I COULD be wrong on that. I'm not simping for this girl or anything, the reason I found her so fascinating in the first place is because I like learning about other cultures, and I just had questions about how it was like growing up in Hong Kong. She is 36, I'm 32. But it makes  me wonder... this has got to be too good to be true right? There's no way I stumbled on to someone that can help me build up money like this right? 

If you guys have any other questions don't hesitate to ask. I'm ignorant on trading and I knew I'd get some good answers here. I'd like to think she genuinely wants to help me make more money... but you never know.",2022-08-02 20:13:13

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street tries to rebound from back-to-back losing sessions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/dow-futures-gain-slightly-after-the-three-major-averages-notched-a-second-day-of-losses.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures traded higher Wednesday, as traders tried to regain their footing following back-to-back losing sessions.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143 points, or 0.44%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each gained 0.48%.
*****
> Those moves came as Wall Street worried that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan could further strain already tense U.S.-China relations. China had spent weeks warning her not to make the trip. Markets fell further after three Federal Reserve presidents hinted that further rate hikes would be necessary to combat high inflation.
*****
> Traders also digested mixed remarks from Federal Reserve officials. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Tuesday he was confident that the U.S. economy could achieve a “soft landing.” Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the central bank’s work to tame inflation is “far from done,” while Chicago Fed’s Charles Evans said there’s a chance for a smaller rate hike at the next monetary policy meeting.
*****
> “Despite the fact most of today’s attention is still riveted on the Federal Reserve and its ongoing fight to bring inflation under control, many economic policies have already embarked on a new easing cycle,” said The Leuthold Group’s Jim Paulsen. “The prospect of lower inflation is not only helping to usher in a new easing cycle but is apt to stoke a private-sector confidence revival that has untapped potential.”
*****
> Traders are also anticipating another batch of second-quarter earnings. CVS, Regeneron, Under Armour and Moderna will report before the bell Wednesday.
*****
> In economic data, investors this week are awaiting mortgage demand numbers and PMI data out Wednesday.

1362,My strategy build outperforms the entire market!! A post feedback second look...,"**Strategy design write-up: Bands on Autopilot part 2**

Wow, thank you to all of the people who gave me constructive feedback on my last post. Here are some of the main ideas people pointed out: Lack of long-term compiled data, clear definition on what defines beating the market, and how trading fees effect the profits of the strategy. I have read through all of the comments and given some thought to these ideas and I will be addressing them in this post. Let's start off with the lack of long-term compiled data and defining what beating the market means. Also, for those unfamiliar, here is the strategy build in question:

https://preview.redd.it/mghdxbizllf91.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e717c667a803cb5de1afdc5850182c0e823361eb

For my last post, I compared the performance of ""Bands on Autopilot"" to the performance of the S&P500 during the bear market of 2008 and the bull market of 2021. I also compared the strategy to the assets it was executed on, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL. During both of these periods my strategy outperformed the S&P500 and the assets I traded on. People pointed out that there was some level of overfitting here, so I decided to compile backtesting results from 2008-July 25th 2022. Here are the results:

https://preview.redd.it/pluh7951mlf91.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e368cdd48be519cfa0bb7164473ecfabe657ead6

During this period the strategy returned an incredible 350.86% while my benchmark (S&P500) returned 123.49%. The assets we traded on returned 395.95%. There are a few things to unpack here. Firstly, the risk undertaken by ""Bands on Autopilot"" was significantly lower than that of just holding these four stocks. Yes, I got outperformed by \~45% but my exposure to \~128% less potential losses has to be considered a win on some levels. Second, year over year this strategy was extremely consistent in terms of winning trades despite a lot of market volatility. This gives more certainty for the strategic outlook than just buying and holding. If the 4 assets I traded all lost money for the next 15 years, at least I know my strategy would consistently save me a ton of money during that period.

The next logical step is to test this strategy against some different assets. To select these assets I looked up the most popular stocks on reddit for 2022 (most of which probably came from wallstreetbets). Here are the top reddit stocks listed: TSLA, GME, AAPL, AMZN, AMD, WISH, TWTR, and AMC. I also decided to select five random stocks from five different sectors. The five stocks randomly selected were BA, CHTR, MCD, PG, and XOM. Here is a screenshot of my portfolio for the second round of testing:

[Reddit loves meme stocks!](https://preview.redd.it/8j3zd0q4mlf91.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15b4797dacd92bf42f5c59c96159debdac1e7cde)

Here is a 2008-July 25th 2022 breakdown of the results for this portfolio:

https://preview.redd.it/33i3hp1iemf91.png?width=2074&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13bf5133bd1c158516e7aab080a3b9311d3f4911

During this period, ""Bands on Autopilot"" returned 357.98% while the benchmark returned 48.96%. The assets I traded on returned 439.73%. Compared to buying and holding the S&P500, this strategy absolutely rocks. However, buying and holding the assets in this portfolio would have yielded higher returns. These returns would come with a substantially higher risk potential of 455.02% compared to the strategies risk potential of 278.80%. Similar to the other breakdown, the percentage of overall winning trades was widely consistent. This consistency along with the risk mitigation shown instills confidence for future use of this strategy. It should be noted that in periods of heavy market losses, this strategy really shines. Anytime the S&P500 was negative on the year, the strategy was outperforming the assets it traded on by notable margins. It should also be noted that a large chunk of the asset performance came from the meme stock blow up.

Between both strategy breakdowns, the average trade return was typically somewhere between 0.05% and 0.20%. Due to many trading brokerages having fees for trading, scalping such low percentages would make this strategy unviable for long term use as you would lose more money from fees than you would make from the trades themselves. However, a brokerage that does not charge per trade, and only requires a set monthly payment for use would make this a possibility. For users who asked on the last post, slippage is accounted for within these backtests.

In conclusion, extended backtesting with multiple portfolio builds increased the frame of reference enough for me to identify the true strengths and weaknesses of this strategy.

1364,My strategy build outperforms the entire market!! A post feedback second look...,"**Strategy design write-up: Bands on Autopilot part 2**

Wow, thank you to all of the people who gave me constructive feedback on my last post. Here are some of the main ideas people pointed out: Lack of long-term compiled data, clear definition on what defines beating the market, and how trading fees effect the profits of the strategy. I have read through all of the comments and given some thought to these ideas and I will be addressing them in this post. Let's start off with the lack of long-term compiled data and defining what beating the market means. Also, for those unfamiliar, here is the strategy build in question:

https://preview.redd.it/3tp53pcesqf91.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51e29bea76fbf26ecd548b01e3f6d31b58901862

For my last post, I compared the performance of ""Bands on Autopilot"" to the performance of the S&P500 during the bear market of 2008 and the bull market of 2021. I also compared the strategy to the assets it was executed on, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL. During both of these periods my strategy outperformed the S&P500 and the assets I traded on. People pointed out that there was some level of overfitting here, so I decided to compile backtesting results from 2008-July 25th 2022. Here are the results:

https://preview.redd.it/k1uqqudhsqf91.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd9d9b732bec8d523440c5e1038d332fd26e2f62

During this period the strategy returned an incredible 350.86% while my benchmark (S&P500) returned 123.49%. The assets we traded on returned 395.95%. There are a few things to unpack here. Firstly, the risk undertaken by ""Bands on Autopilot"" was significantly lower than that of just holding these four stocks. Yes, I got outperformed by \~45% but my exposure to \~128% less potential losses has to be considered a win on some levels. Second, year over year this strategy was extremely consistent in terms of winning trades despite a lot of market volatility. This gives more certainty for the strategic outlook than just buying and holding. If the 4 assets I traded all lost money for the next 15 years, at least I know my strategy would consistently save me a ton of money during that period.

The next logical step is to test this strategy against some different assets. To select these assets I looked up the most popular stocks on reddit for 2022 (most of which probably came from wallstreetbets). Here are the top reddit stocks listed: TSLA, GME, AAPL, AMZN, AMD, WISH, TWTR, and AMC. I also decided to select five random stocks from five different sectors. The five stocks randomly selected were BA, CHTR, MCD, PG, and XOM. Here is a screenshot of my portfolio for the second round of testing:

[Reddit loves meme stocks!](https://preview.redd.it/kznj5tyjsqf91.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85ce2fdc1571f3109517849f9fa361ab7098b1a3)

Here is a 2008-July 25th 2022 breakdown of the results for this portfolio:

https://preview.redd.it/eneyu0olsqf91.png?width=2074&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97ac3a3735ffbc272b251649a7085f61e6d08d1c

During this period, ""Bands on Autopilot"" returned 357.98% while the benchmark returned 48.96%. The assets I traded on returned 439.73%. Compared to buying and holding the S&P500, this strategy absolutely rocks. However, buying and holding the assets in this portfolio would have yielded higher returns. These returns would come with a substantially higher risk potential of 455.02% compared to the strategies risk potential of 278.80%. Similar to the other breakdown, the percentage of overall winning trades was widely consistent. This consistency along with the risk mitigation shown instills confidence for future use of this strategy. It should be noted that in periods of heavy market losses, this strategy really shines. Anytime the S&P500 was negative on the year, the strategy was outperforming the assets it traded on by notable margins. It should also be noted that a large chunk of the asset performance came from the meme stock blow up.

Between both strategy breakdowns, the average trade return was typically somewhere between 0.05% and 0.20%. Due to many trading brokerages having fees for trading, scalping such low percentages would make this strategy unviable for long term use as you would lose more money from fees than you would make from the trades themselves. However, a brokerage that does not charge per trade, and only requires a set monthly payment for use would make this a possibility. For users who asked on the last post, slippage is accounted for within these backtests.

In conclusion, extended backtesting with multiple portfolio builds increased the frame of reference enough for me to identify the true strengths and weaknesses of this strategy. Having learned a lot from this experience, I am heading back to the drawing board to create a strategy that outperforms this one in more ways than one. Also, before I get spammed with millions of DM's and comments again asking what platform I used to construct this strategy, its called Plutofi. Just google it, linking it here is breaking subreddit rules. One other thing, thank you to the users who actually respectfully critique these strategies builds and help myself and others improve.

1365,AMC will issue a dividend to all common shareholders. will be paid in form of preferred equity units $APE,"AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) announced today that it has declared a special dividend of one AMC Preferred Equity unit (an “AMC Preferred Equity Unit”) for each share of AMC Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), outstanding at the close of business on August 15, 2022. The special dividend is expected to be paid at the close of business on August 19, 2022.

The Company has applied to list its AMC Preferred Equity Units on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “APE” starting August 22, 2022 and each AMC Preferred Equity Unit is designed to have the same economic and voting rights as one share of Common Stock.

Source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220804005449/en/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220804005449/en/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units)

AMC will issue a dividend to all common shareholders. The dividend will be paid in form of preferred equity units, which it has applied to list as symbol: $APE. 

Do you own AMC shares or just trade options?",2022-08-05 10:20:34
1366,Question: Is AMC Short/Put really such a no-brainer right now??,"Hi all, I am planning to extend my short / put position on AMC on Monday because my interpretation is this whole thing is the no-brainer of the year. On August 22, the $APE will start trading and it will dilute the economic and control interest of $AMC stock by issuing another 100% shares. The Apes are irrational so I realize it will not cut the stock price in half but I cannot believe it will not drop...

Further, it is crystal clear that Management is planning to raise more capital via a prefshare issuance with subsequent conversion. If I had to make a bet, I'd say they need to do that prior Q2 23 because cash will get real tight then and deferred lease payments become due.

Because this is a share issuance and not a split there will be no adjustment of option prices etc. as well (?)

So I think a combination of shorting shares (as we cannot exactly know when Management will pull the trigger on further dilution) plus puts that expire 2 weeks after the Aug 22 issuance.

What really confuses me is that the option chain has not reacted to this so far, it is still as if there was no dilution coming in 2 weeks.

Is there something I am not seeing here? It seems to be a no-brainer to buy say 20$ puts??",2022-08-07 06:51:21
1367,There has never been a better time than now to go short AMC,"TL;DR 

**The AMC dividend gives AMC the ability to dilute up to 450 % after ex-div date of APE token without seeking any shareholder approval.** 

**Ape token has same voting rights as AMC common stock on allowing conversion from APE to AMC -> you own majority of shares in AMC+APE through either ticker you control AMC.**

**Stock is not down 80 % yet so this shit is gonna come down hard soon (I give it a month max NFA). Easy short, puts into and after ex dividend date = free money (???). Bulls r insanely fk.**

Positions: 12 puts in range 19-22 for september monthly expiry initially. Will scale into more degen bets in the coming weeks. I am not early, but others are seemingly stupid giving us the chance to grab puts on the cheap after news which should have tanked the stock price

POST BEGIN: 

As most of us know AMC had earnings on thursday after hours. It was a sought after earnings as AA had been hinting to something big happening, a “pounce” some might say. What this proved to be was a Preferred stock dividend with the ticker $APE (lol). Most people were let down by this, some were excited, but if you look under the hood it is insane how the AMC stock price as of today ended the day up over 18 % and you might think how the fuck did that happen? Earnings sucked balls!  AMC had a shitton of [FTDs due](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/failure_to_deliver/?quote=AMC) this week as can be seen below, but thats not important.

&#x200B;

[AMC Failure to delivers due last week](https://preview.redd.it/mxehqxv44ag91.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=06147516e012cbc9d32a9854e90685f4a3ff4831)

Last year AMC sought shareholder approval for an issuance of an additional 25 million shares to raise cash, but shareholders dissapproved of this as the apes had gotten tired of getting diluted. With AMCs current cash burn rate and their deferred rent payments at the time they did not have a lot of runway left before an inevitable bankruptcy unless they drastically improved their business. The most recent quarter AMC posted a loss to the tune of 121.6 million $, no share dilution approved still, but in comes AA with “the pounce”.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h3j29n094ag91.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a70372a27dc544567ef77e06c7db1f6ad2103bc

What this pounce actually turned out to be was a big middle finger to all the investors who disapproved of their requested 25 million share dilution last year. He did not only find a way to get this dilution without shareholder approval. He did not double down, not quadruple down but 100x double down by issuing a new stock which have the exact same voting rights as AMC common stock on the conversion from APE to AMC (lol).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2nsjn4b4ag91.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7448658ae05008c531f620740f2e7e65dbde08fe

This new ticker which we all know as $APE will give AA and the C-suite the ability to dilute it up to 4.5 billion shares after it has started trading on the NYSE. AA says black on white this was his plan B if investors didnt approve of a dilution (He always finds a way to dilute ;) )

&#x200B;

He is also no stranger to dilution. Through the late parts of 2021 and first half of 2021 he diluted like his life depended on it as we see in the image below.

Some might say “but the APE dilution doesn’t matter as AMC wont be diluted so my shares should retain their value”. This is wrong because the $APE shares have literally all the properties AMC have when it comes to the vote for conversion. The ""vote for conversion"" if passed would make it so that one share of APE will be convertable into 1 common share of AMC. And if that vote passes 1 share of ape is identical to 1 share of AMC. You control majority vote through either APE or AMC you control the company. Its literally the same stock, but a different ticker.

In the relevant SEC filing on page 2 we find the following:

From the same document we have black on white that they can dilute the APE token without seeking any shareholder approval

 So both preferred stock units and common shares get the same voting power and can vote on the common stock amendment. AA can dilute the preferred stock by up to 4.5 billion shares. Assuming retail owns the entire float of AMC (this is not true) that means they will have to buy up after full dilution a minimum of 1.739 billion APE tokens from all dilutions to exclude any chance of being outvoted by any others on the conversion vote from $APE to $AMC common stock. Retail simply does not have that capital, and to be frank they do not own the float on AMC. Last shareholders meeting had a total of 268,775,910 voters as can be seen in the relevant SEC filing.

 What’s even more funny is now during the weekend Adam Aron himself is admitting its a dilution on twitter and is floundering around trying to “calm” his investors stating this is \*\*Good diluton\*\* and not bad dilution.

From history AA is gonna dilute APE fast and dilute it hard to raise more capital to use on new acquisitions. Who knows, maybe he buys another unprofitable mine with shareholder raised money.",2022-08-07 07:58:09
1368,APE does not dilute AMC ... at least not at first,"There's lots of talk about the issuance of APE to immediately dilute AMC stock. This is not how dilution works.

*B-b-but more shares price go down means dilute!*

This is not what defines dilution, so unless you want to start redefining words, let's get to what dilution really means. In order to dilute a stock, you need to reduce the % ownership of a holder who does absolutely nothing but hold. If you have 10mil shares of AMC you own roughly 2% of the company. If you bought those 10mil on March 10th, 2021, you owned 11.7% of the entire fucking company. On March 11th, your ownership dropped to 2.2% ... Yes, you read that right. In one day, you woke up to seeing your ownership of an entire multi-billion dollar company go from 11.7% to 2.2%! That's some serious dilution. It would go on to dilute a tiny bit more over the next 5 months, like drop your 2.2% to 2.0%-ish.

Relax, Adam Aron said this *good dilution.* [There's good dilution and there's bad dilution.](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555949799362396160?s=20&t=3Q24Fd9JGUnXbRm_SEWdEw) This historically has allowed AA to cash out of ALL of his AMC position that he was legally allowed to sell (retirement is difficult to prepare for, amirite?) AND raise funds for the company, this is good. Don't worry about your own ~~bags~~ portfolio, that's not part of what makes dilution good or bad. Let's focus on the ~~execs~~ company, because without the company, you shareholders are worthless.

Okay, so [AA is technically correct](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555959338442919939?s=20&t=3Q24Fd9JGUnXbRm_SEWdEw), this initial APE ticker going live August ~~19rd~~ 19st* is not dilution. But wait, what's this about [offering more APE?](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555959339487313922?s=20&t=3Q24Fd9JGUnXbRm_SEWdEw) Ahhh, here's where we get dilution. How many we talkin here, equivalent of ~~dumping~~ selling another 50mil shares?

Wait, what? 4,500,000,000 additional? That's what an upcoming vote will be about, the real dilution. They cannot dilute this without a vote. The entire reasoning behind APE is to trick shareholders into voting for dilution via APE since diluting via AMC didn't work (voted NO already).

Position: never bought a single option or share of AMC in my life. 70% of my portfolio is in GME and 20% is in BBBY.

1369,"My entry strategy, review it, roast it, give me feedback","So I still consider myself new to trading, even though I've been doing it for a few years. I'm still learning, I have good phases and downturns and still battling a few emotions, thought I had them squared away but I surprised myself a little bit. I'm honing in on something that is easy for me to understand and maneuver during the trading day, and I'm getting better with it as long as I handle my emotions in the trade. I'm curious what people think about this style and I'm prepared for all the good and the bad. I'm very aware that this is quite a rudimentary setup with flaws, I'm hoping to find a steady spot where I at least don't lose too much money while I gain more experience.

The style is breakout momentum trading mostly on large cap using 3m chart (i will trade something like amc on a news day/week). What I have is an entry strategy here (I struggle with entries more than exits and management). It's simple, and I use a few custom indicators to assist me. Please spare the standard lecture about lagging indicators, I'm very aware, they are just for helping visualize the strength of the momentum.

1. Price Momentum Oscillator with 'Chop Zone'. Standard PMO but I've added a zone for each where a trade should be avoided if the momentum shifts within it, since it's a higher likelihood it is does not have good enough momentum. This zone must be determined for each stock by analyzing past price action, it's not a magic bullet.
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator, with added coloring.
3. Support and Resistance Levels with break indicator.
4. VWAP and key inflection points on the daily/hourly levels are all viewable on each chart.

A Setup:

After 10:15. Designated by the arrows in the screenshots, a recent support/resistance level has been broken, and the candle after the breaking candle closed above/below that line, a one candle confirmation of the break. Watch the order book for a possible pullback entry position. The PMO and CMO are also in agreement with the direction and outside of the chop zone. Enter at that point with a stop that is below/above the broken line, breakouts shouldn't be swinging against me, if it does exit it fast. We can try again if a better setup emerges.

B Setup:

After 10:00. Arrow presented on the chart that a S/R level was broken, PMO and CMO agree but they are in the chop zone, preferably on the edge at least. Keep a tight stop and don't give it too much trust/risk.

This strategy yields only a few trades a day, but for me, the fewer trades always equals better quality trades. You can see from the screenshots that my main 4 large cap tickers presented no setups on Friday, but a few were presented on the secondary watch list. If the losers were cut fast, the winners were well... very profitable. In my experience, the success ratio can be below 50 if there are enough false breaks in a day, so I need to let my breakouts run, I go for a 2.0 risk/reward ratio to begin trimming the position.

Once in the trade I use the dom and key levels on the chart and manage the position by hand, trimming at 2 and the rest on a discretionary basis as the move plays out.

BBBY and BYND presented breaks but they were not supported by momentum indicators. No A or B trades.

AMC presented 2 A setups

TSLA presented 2 B setups

1371,"Bed Bath & Beyond shares jump more than 50% as message board mentions soar on the troubled, heavily shorted stock"," Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond jumped nearly 60% on Monday as meme traders seemed to be betting on the stock despite any apparent catalyst for the move.

The heavily shorted stock, which has tumbled more than 44% this year, was the most searched name on the WallStreetBets discussion board on Monday according to Quiver Quantitative, where users under a pinned thread titled “AMC and BBBY Memestock Megathread for Monday August 8th, 2022” appeared to be buying up shares of the retail stock.

One user said they “took out a 27k loan, went all in on BBY,” which a group moderator seemed to confirm. Another user (TheDude0007) alleged to have capitalized on the BBBY spike, turning $45,000 into almost $450,000 using common stock and call options.

Bed Bath & Beyond has been a part of the meme stock craze that has hit Wall Street in recent years and driven names like GameStop and AMC Entertainment higher as investors bought up shares and forced short sellers to attempt to cover their losses, creating what’s known as a “short squeeze.” According to data from FactSet, a whopping 46% of the stock’s float is sold short.

As many retailers cope with inflation-wary consumers and excess inventory, Bed Bath & Beyond has struggled to reverse declining sales, fix its merchandising strategy and gain back customers who have fled to its competitors — all while searching for a new leader after the board announced in late June that its CEO Mark Tritton had left the company.

At the same time, the Union, N.J.-based home goods retailer has also been burning through cash as its net losses grow. While the company has not provided a forecast, it said it expects same-store sales trends to improve after plummeting 24% year-over-year in the quarter ended May 28.

Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/bed-bath-beyond-shares-jump-30percent-as-message-board-mentions-soar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/bed-bath-beyond-shares-jump-30percent-as-message-board-mentions-soar.html)

Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NASDAQ, is currently up 37%. Reddit apes continue to mobilize a coordinated short squeeze in Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY). Are you in?",2022-08-08 10:01:23
1372,IMAX AND Cinemark. This is the way.,"As a long term holder of Cinemark, I can’t believe theater stocks, omitting AMC for hopefully obvious reasons, are not on track to quicker recovery to the respective pre-pandemic highs. 

In the current stock market what do you want? Well if you’re like me in your 20s you’re probably looking to make above average returns by investing in higher risk stocks I.e. pre-dividend& growth stocks >500MM.

So why are people not swallowing up theater stocks like IMAX and Cinemark who ARE RAISING OR MAINTAINING FULL YEAR GUIDANCE. People love AMC but fail to realize they can choose the competition and get the best of both worlds money and investing in something they understand; that is movies.

That is literally all your company needs to do in this market to not get creamed.  Maintain or raise guidance. If they’re doing this: You are still right. 

Curious when people will learn and reach beyond the meme. Bless ‘em.",2022-08-09 18:58:34
1373,"Jim Cramer says ""Don’t bet against short sellers in this market."" Do you think this BBBY short squeeze has some way to go?"," CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Tuesday warned investors to avoid buying money-losing stocks in a bet against short sellers.

The market went in favor of short-sellers on Tuesday after the major indices fell. The market teetered earlier in the day as it digested disappointing financial reports from companies and prepared for key inflation numbers later this week.

“In a market that’s presenting you with ample opportunities to lose money, I can’t endorse buying these money-losing stocks in the hope of engineering a short squeeze. Sooner or later, you end up with a day like today where that tactic just blows up in your face,” the “Mad Money” host said.

Here are the stocks Cramer referred to:

* Bed Bath & Beyond
* Upstart
* AMC
* Beyond Meat
* Wayfair
* GameStop

More investors appear to be trying their luck with short-selling. The GS Most Short Index, which measures stocks that investors are shorting, or betting against, rose more than 18% over the last five days. It’s currently at its highest level since last January, when the meme stock craze was at its peak.

Cramer warned investors that this action is making money-losing stocks look deceptively attractive as long-term plays.

“When good things happen to bad stocks, I get nervous. We’ve seen a lot of low quality stocks rallying purely because too many hedge funds shorted them at the same time and those shorts ended up getting squeezed,” he said.

1376,Robinhood ordered to face ‘meme stock’ manipulation claims,"Stock trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc must face market manipulation claims over restrictions it placed on trading during last year’s “meme stock” rally, a U.S. judge ruled on Thursday.

U.S. District Court Judge Cecilia Altonaga in Miami said in the ruling that investors in GameStop Corp, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and seven other stocks can proceed with a proposed class action lawsuit alleging the restrictions artificially increased the stocks’ supply.

The lawsuit was one of several cases brought against the retail trading platform after it temporarily barred customers from buying certain hot stocks in January 2021, including GameStop and AMC.

Shares of those companies surged to extreme highs thanks to a social media-fueled rally that eventually led Robinhood and others to restrict trading in the affected securities, infuriating retail investors and rattling market confidence. The volatility caused major losses for hedge funds that had bet against the meme stocks.

An attorney for Robinhood did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

A death spiral describes a type of convertible asset that forces the creation of an ever-increasing number of shares, inevitably leading to a steep drop in the prices of shares (aka dilution).


As AMC stock price increases substantially, $APE holders are likely to seize the opportunity to convert their $APE shares into $AMC.

This process by definition increases the number of $AMC shares in the market, and that forces prices lower.

The death spiral effect occurs as more and more $APE shares are converted to $AMC as their value drops lower and lower",2022-08-13 00:07:11

Shares of cryptocurrency-related companies such as [Coinbase Global Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/COIN). and triple-leveraged exchange-traded funds tracking the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index have also soared.

The S&P 500 is up 17% over the same period but remains down 10% for the year. With inflation remaining near multiyear highs, some investors worry parts of the market are in for another punishing selloff, especially if the Fed has to raise interest rates for longer than expected. When interest rates were at historic lows, investors got big returns from piling into shares of richly valued, often unprofitable companies. 

The fact that bond yields were so low made even the riskiest stocks—as well as other investments, like cryptocurrencies—look like an attractive proposition for many investors. Rising rates reverse that dynamic.“I can’t argue that this pace \[of market gains\] is going to continue,” said Nancy Tengler,chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments. “Whether we are in recession now or are going to be in one in the third or fourth quarter, you know economic growth is going to slow.”That means it is prudent to be even more selective about what types of companies the firm is putting money into, she said.📷

That has helped spark a rebound in not just stock but also bond prices. 

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which falls as bond prices rise, fell to 2.848% Friday, down from its mid-June peak of 3.482%.📷

Skeptics, however, warn that it might be too early to assume that the Fed will change tacks in 2023. July’s CPI and PPI readings were good news for the markets. And they certainly gave wind to the idea that the Fed will raise interest rates by half a point at its September meeting, instead of three-quarters of a point as initially expected.📷

But just one or two lower inflation readings won’t suffice in convincing the Fed that inflation is dissipating, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Some factors driving inflation higher have also yet to ease.

1383,AMC ex-dividend date of 8/19 and APE shares plus covered calls,"Well, here is where I am at and looking for some advice as this whole ""dividend"" (stock split) has me confused. I've sold 20 covered calls on AMC for 8/19 at the 20 strike. There is a very good chance that these will be called away, and I am okay with that. I've made about $14k this year selling covered calls since January when I started my position, and my cost basis is 24.72 per share. Yes, I sold deep ITM covered calls to protect my downside.

My question is since the record date is August 15th (got that one), and ex-dividend date is August 19th (the day my calls will potentially be exercised) do I qualify for the APE shares?

I have done a lot of searching and heard it both ways. One group says I qualify, while the other says I don't because I will have sold before August 22nd which is the distribution date.

Does anyone have definitive information on how this will work?

1384,Bull Case - It's $PRTY Time,"The recent meme-stock rally is very reminiscent of 2021, and it’s got me about as jacked up as a Boomer with a portfolio full of T-Bills in a newly built 55+ community McMansion. If we learned anything from GME, AMC, BBBY, etc., the right question to ask right now is “WTF is next!?”. I took it a step further and asked, “what would Papa Cohen do”? So, while everyone was laser-focused on BBBY over the last few weeks I decided to do some digging around for value plays \[for the record: I am also long BBBY\].

Something I noticed across all these names, other than the obvious short interest:

1. They are brick and mortar retail with what appears to be one foot in the grave
2. Low market cap, though AMC might be an exception
3. Low share price for easy degenerate option bets
4. They are all nostalgic companies from the 90s and 00s
5. Recently beat down prices with higher-than-normal short interest
6. They are all companies struggling to pivot in the consumer space

A few weeks back, someone brought a name to me that checked all of these boxes and then some, that name is Party City Inc (PRTY). I know what you are thinking “I haven’t stepped food in one in this decade”, “that’s a penny stock”, “their balance sheet is dogshit” – but hear me out.

1. 800 company-owned and franchise stores throughout North America
2. Market Cap of $229mm as of writing, super low
3. Share price of $2 as of writing, super low
4. Brand name that I know, and that I recall shopping at as a youngin
5. Down over 60% YTD, Short interest <10% Float (and growing)
6. Obviously struggling to pivot – like guys just give me an app I can order supplies/balloons/etc. on

In recent disclosures PRTY mentioned how they were having trouble fulfilling inventory due to supply chain issues. Now, this is arguably, but I would say that is a great problem to have. That means there is more demand for the goods they sell than the supply! Anyone else having flashbacks to ECON101? I’m no expert but to me this is a major plus, and just a temporary problem.

In addition to this they have the opportunity to pivot and further increase demand/revenue, assuming they can get the supply issues under control. Have you been tot heir website? Absolute garbage imho. Just give me an easy way to order what I need and have a pickup and delivery option at a reasonable fee. They’d have their market segment in the bag if they pulled this off.

There is also the elephant in the room… HALLO –fricking- WEEN\*\*.\*\* **Halloween and 4Q have historically been a profit driver for PRTY, and now with COVID restriction mostly behind us, its increasingly likely there will be a massive revenue bump as people start getting out and about**. Remember – those COVID babies are now 2 years old, and new parents LOVE Halloween (and spending $$$ on it).

Now let’s look at some numbers…

https://preview.redd.it/39shdxw9s9i91.png?width=149&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d8a11f9e1fb13c1d7f762a18895dbb2c28593dae

There is not much that can be said other than this is exactly what a value play looks like. They are literally reporting more income than their shares are worth.

https://preview.redd.it/d3svujuas9i91.png?width=169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a15d9472bb83a4f638fd2709ca910d72cdf87f6

Bonkers ROE. This is the type of stuff P/E and Hedge Funds pull. Something has got to give, and my guess is it will be the equity price increasing, which decreases this ratio.

https://preview.redd.it/a60d9kqbs9i91.png?width=163&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=558a6b6641dd3f10b58d829908649a02b5e64c35

Yikes - This looks no bueno. The thing is, most companies’ have debt and given PRTY’s depressed equity price it likely makes more sense issue long-term debt than to use their equity should they need capital.

&#x200B;

[I see you staring at the little tip up at the end there you dirty monkey](https://preview.redd.it/2503edqcs9i91.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=deab4392eef83ee0168e9efb62c68bc1acd89c4c)

This stock has just been beat up, as has most of the market. It started trending up recently, which I find really interesting - meme basket trades? pure momentum/beta? large buyer who sees similar value? I'm banking on the latter.

**TLDR**

PRTY has been so beat up that the equity is being valued as if they are essentially bankrupt. I am taking the bet this company is a going concern, and that the brand name alone worth more than $200mm in current market cap.

I don’t give advice - I just give my opinion. Always do your own homework!

1385,They're STILL shorting BBBY. Squeeze em'!,"Bed Bath & Beyond stock’s [latest surge](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-stock-price-meme-trade-51660597119?mod=article_inline) has caused **serious pain** for the short sellers betting against the company. And it’s not getting any easier for [prospective short sellers](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-stock-meme-trade-51659971172?mod=article_inline), either.

After rising 29% on Tuesday, Bed Bath & Beyond stock (BBBY) was up another 31% in Wednesday afternoon trading to $27.02. [Unlike on Tuesday](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-koss-gamestop-amc-stock-price-meme-rally-51660685560?mod=article_inline), though, the rally didn’t extend to other meme stocks. Shares of GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) were down 1.3% and 7.7%, respectively.

Ihor Dusaniwsky of short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners told that his firm estimates Bed Bath’s short interest at $70.22 million, or 55% of shares available for trading.

“We’ve seen an increase in shares shorted even as BBBY’s stock price has soared recently,” Dusaniwsky wrote in an e-mail. “This does not mean that there has not been a short squeeze in BBBY, because there have been many short sellers who have trimmed or closed out their positions due to excessive recent mark-to-market losses. It means that there are short sellers coming in to replace those that are exiting their trades.”

Short sellers borrow stock, then sell it. Their hope is that the price declines so that they can buy the same equity at a lower price to repay the stock and pocket the difference between the sale price and the later purchase price. It’s a risky strategy because a stock can rise infinitely, whereas a long investment has limited downside, since a stock can only fall until it hits zero. Short sellers must also pay interest on the value of the stock borrowed, known as a stock borrow fee.

When it comes to Bed Bath & Beyond, short sellers are facing a tough time finding shares to short, Dusaniwsky says. The stock borrow fee for existing Bed Bath short positions is 13.6%, while new stock borrows face a 50% fee, according to S3. The average S&P 500 stock has a 0.57% borrow rate per year, according to Dusaniwsky. To short $1,000 in Bed Bath stock, an investor would currently have to pay $500 a year or $1.39 a day, compared with a fee of $5.70 a year or 2 cents a day for the average S&P 500 stock.

When highly shorted stocks rise, short sellers can spark even more buying demand because they rush to buy stock to close their short positions. That’s why retail investors piled into shares of highly shorted firms like GameStop and AMC Entertainment [in January of 2021](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-gamestop-revolt-has-just-begun-get-ready-51611972649?mod=article_inline). That event, which sent GameStop stock parabolic, began around the time Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen and two of his associates joined GameStop’s board. Cohen, now GameStop’s chairman, is an activist investor at Bed Bath and [won three board seats in March.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-stock-ryan-cohen-settlement-51648197640?mod=article_inline)

Bed Bath short sellers short sellers were down $179 million in mark-to-market losses on Wednesday, based on this morning’s 25% gain, and $688 million in August. For the year, the shorts were down $586 million.

“We expect the BBBY short squeeze to continue as mark-to-market losses continue to mount and more new short sellers get in at these higher stock prices looking for a whipsaw of stock prices down,” Dusaniwsky added.

Short sellers have been betting against the stock amid concerns the retailer could face a liquidity crunch. Bed Bath was one of [seven companies](https://www.barrons.com/articles/companies-liquidity-squeeze-risk-express-bed-bath-beyond-rite-aid-51660340149?mod=article_inline) Barron’s identified last week because of its need to refinance its debt or borrow more. The company said it had $1 billion available in its revolving credit facility.

“We have already taken actions on many fronts—including a reduction of at least $100 million of [capital expenditure] against the company’s original plan,” a company representative said.

That doesn’t mean Wall Street is optimistic. B. Riley analyst Susan Anderson on Tuesday [downgraded](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-stock-sell-rating-51660669175?mod=article_inline) Bed Bath stock to Sell from Neutral, arguing the current valuation is “unwarranted.” She has a $5 price target.

1387,"AMC's ""Relatively Weak"" Q3","Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) dropped 3.01% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the movie theatre company commented on the state of its business.

Bearish: AMC Chairman and CEO Adam Aron said in a statement that “the film slate in the third quarter of 2022 is expected to be relatively weak.”

Bullish: However, Aron also said that the company is “optimistic about the increasing demand for our portfolio of movie theatres” and that AMC has more than $1 billion in liquidity.

Background: The comments come one day after rival Cineworld (OTCMKTS: CNWGY) said that recent admissions levels have been “below expectations” and there will be a limited film slate that will last until November. The company said this will negatively impact the business.

Numbers: Cineworld’s stock is down 74% in 2022. AMC’s stock is down 27% this year but is up 17% in the past 30 days.

Final Thoughts: It’s a rough time for the movie theatre industry. And AMC is still living up to its meme stock reputation.

1391,Cineworld shares plummet more than 60% on bankruptcy reports,"* **Shares of British cinema chain Cineworld Group plunged Friday on reports that it is preparing to file for bankruptcy after failing to entice viewers back to movie theaters.**
* **The stock was down around 63% in mid-afternoon trade in London.**
* **The company is reportedly expected to file a chapter 11 petition in the U.S. and is considering filing an insolvency proceeding in the U.K.**

Shares of British cinema chain [Cineworld Group](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CINE-GB) plunged Friday on reports that it is preparing to file for bankruptcy after failing to entice viewers back to movie theatres following a pandemic lull.

The stock was down around 63% in mid-afternoon trade in London, up just slightly from earlier Friday, when it hit a record low of 1.8 pence per share.

It follows [reports first cited in The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regal-cinemas-owner-cineworld-prepares-for-bankruptcy-filing-11660910944) that the company, which owns Regal Cinemas, had engaged a team of lawyers and consultants to advise on the bankruptcy process, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company is expected to file a chapter 11 petition in the U.S. and is considering filing an insolvency proceeding in the U.K., they said.

Cineworld did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.

## Fewer big-budget movies hurt attendance

Cineworld, which operates 9,000 theaters in 10 countries,[ warned Wednesday that a lack of blockbusters](https://www.reuters.com/business/uks-cineworld-warns-low-footfall-theatres-persist-2022-08-17/) was hurting admissions and would likely persist until November, impacting the company’s liquidity.

It is the latest casualty of the movie theater industry, which has struggled to regain its footing following coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, with viewers increasingly inclined to stream movie releases at home.

Box office [ticket sales are down 30% compared to 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/avatar-rogue-one-and-spider-man-no-way-home-return-to-theaters.html). Meantime, there have been 30% fewer movies released in theaters owing to filming disruptions during the pandemic and a tendency for some production companies to release directly to streaming platforms.

Shares of other U.S. theater companies AMC and CNK were both down around 5% in mid-morning trade, recovering slightly from an earlier dip.

Cineworld said Wednesday that despite the success of hits such as “Top Gun: Maverick” and some Marvel movies, not enough big films were hitting cinemas.

“Despite a gradual recovery of demand since re-opening in April 2021, recent admission levels have been below expectations,” the company said.

Cineworld’s net debt stood at [$8.9 billion at the end of 2021](https://www.cineworldplc.com/sites/cineworld-plc/files/reports-presentation/2022/annual-report-2021.pdf) compared to revenues of $1.8 billion.

Law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP and consultants from AlixPartners are said to be advising on the bankruptcy proceedings, according to the WSJ.

Neither were available for comment when contacted by CNBC.",2022-08-19 21:50:59

The APE units were announced as a special dividend to Class A common stockholders when AMC reported second-quarter earnings earlier in August. At the time, CEO Adam Aron called the move “perhaps the single biggest action we will take in all of 2022 to fundamentally strengthen AMC for the long term.

1403,AMC and APE shares bounce after bruising session.,"The apes can take a breather after a tough start to the week.

AMC stock rose about 4% in premarket trading on Tuesday, coming on the heels of tanking 41% amid news of a bankruptcy at rival Cineworld and the debut of new $APE preferred shares. APE stock rallied roughly 11% in premarket trading after dropping 13.6% on debut day.

The company's new class of shares — a nod to the retail investors who powered the stock during the COVID-19 pandemic and commonly refer to themselves as apes — began trading on the NYSE on Monday. The stock was halted 10 times during the session, AMC CEO Adam Aron noted on Twitter.

A single APE unit was granted for each common share, meaning that about 517 million shares of this new stock will be formed.

Despite the weak debut for APE, AMC supporters talked up the new class of stock throughout the day on Twitter and Reddit message boards.

""Im not f\*\*\*ing leaving,"" one self described ape tweeted to Yahoo Finance.

Aron told Yahoo Finance Live (video above) that the company's new APE shares should allay fears that the movie chain could cripple under the weight of debt incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It takes survival risk off the table in the near term,"" Aron said. ""So we can raise cash if we need it. That is good for our shareholders.""

Chanos said he believes they ""should be the same price, or roughly the same price.""

The founder of Kynikos Associates said he is ""counting on them to close,"" and he thinks ""ultimately they'll all be the same class.""

AMC stock fell on Monday after the APE units began trading after being issued as a special dividend in a nod to retail investors. The preferred shares have the same voting rights as AMC common stock.

Despite the similarities, AMC trades at a premium to the preferred shares, although the gap is closing with AMC common stock trading at $9.52 and the APE preferred shares at $7.26 at the time of writing.

""Functionally, the two securities are the same. And I'd guess the apes will be putting pressure on Mr. Aron, if the discount continues, to make it freely convertable sooner rather than later,"" Chanos told CNBC.

Chanos also questioned the decision by AMC CEO Adam Aron to take on debt to make acquisitions before the pandemic, stating he has put ""out a lot of fires here, but a lot of the fires he helped set.""

“Griffin’s interest in the market dates to 1986, when a negative Forbes magazine story on Home Shopping Network, the mass seller of inexpensive baubles, piqued his interest and inspired him to buy some put options.” (Meet Kenneth Griffin p.2)

He, “bought one or two put options contracts, and turned a quick $5,000 profit when the stock fell.” (Meet Kenneth Griffin p.2)

Kenny’s first play back in 1986 seems to foreshadow the career that will follow. Dude could have posted his gains with the rest of you. He wouldn’t reach mod status until later.

“A shrewd investor — the Cabot House sophomore was short heading into the ’87 crash — Griffin’s stellar returns place his firm among a tiny elite.” (Meet Kenneth Griffin p. 2)

Kenny G. was going short from the very beginning.

“He built an internal stock lending operation in the late 1990s to allow Citadel to fly below Wall Street’s radar screen on sensitive short sales; it’s the kind of operation run only by major investment banks.” (Meet Kenneth Griffin p. 4)

Already finding ways to hide his short sales in the 1990s. Were going to come back to this next part later:

“In September 1990 Griffin began trading a convertible arb strategy as a separate account for Glenwood. One year later, duly impressed with Griffin’s maturity — and his 70 percent returns — Meyer introduced him to Glenwood’s clients, enabling him to raise a then-significant $18 million fund called Wellington Partners. Griffin leased 3,000 square feet of space in an office building in Chicago’s historic Loop district and launched the five-person fund. (Meet Kenneth Griffin p. 6)

“convertible arb” – remember that for later

Basically, though Kenny G is killing it from the get go and he has a strong background in shorting. There’s a lot more in the article, it’s honestly worth a read.

So, Kenny knows how to make a killing in crashes. How did he do in 2008?

But first Failure to Deliver. FTDs.

**PART 2 – FTDs**

**A Super Short History:**

Failure to Deliver or FTDs have been around a long time...

“Tulip mania reached its peak during the winter of 1636-37, when contracts were changing hands five times. No deliveries were ever made to fulfill any of these contracts” (amsterdamtulipmuseumonline.com)

“At the turn of the century, the stock speculator Daniel Drew battled with Cornelius Vanderbilt over control of the Harlem and Erie Railroads by issuing unregistered securities and selling short stock that he had not borrowed.” (Welborn p. 3)

Daniel Drew is the one know for quipping the line famous around here, “He who sells what isn’t his’n, must buy it back or go to pris’n” (Welborn p. 3)

**FTDs in the early 2000s:**

The Dot-Com Bust:

The Continuous Net Settlement system’s “inability to moderate FTDs became clear during the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.” (Welborn p. 8)

The 2000s Crash even led to:

The final short sale rule, Regulation SHO, was passed in August 2004 and became effective in January 2005.” (Welborn p. 8)

REGULATION SHOW! - BYE BYE FTDs! Not really though...

Exceptions “undermined Regulation SHO’s ability to reduce FTDs.” (Welborn p. 9)

The Grandfather Clause “exempted all pre-existing FTD positions, and a market making exception allowed options market makers to delay settlement for the purpose of bona fide market making. Regulation SHO was largely ineffective as a result, and FTDs actually increased from 2005 through 2008 (OEA, 2008 and 2009).” (Welborn p. 9)

Man, the SEC is really on it.

**HOW TO FTD FROM 2005 to 2008**

I found a Dissertation that showed that the GME FTD 'naked short' Thesis was correct back in 2013, and that is all thanks to some prodigy named John W. Welborn.

So, back to 2005. Reg Sho was recently enacted and Market Makers were handed an FTD exemption – they start hiding their FTDs away in options and FTDs increased from 2005 to 2008.

In 2007, the SEC admits that,

“The ability of options market makers to sell short and never have to close out a resulting fail to deliver position... may have a negative impact on the market for those securities” (SEC, 2007b, p. 21). (Welborn p. 25)

Wow! You don’t say...

In “2007 the Commission eliminated the “grandfather” provision and in 2008 the Commission eliminated the “options market maker” exception.” (Key Points About Regulation SHO – [sec.gov](https://sec.gov/))

What's with the stagger? Trying to make sure your friends on Wall Street have time to settle their FTDs? How'd that work out for you?

Market Makers lose their options loophole which leads us to our first chart from John Welborn’s Three Essays on Naked Short Selling and Fails-To-Deliver:

https://preview.redd.it/mymn4bckyvk91.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=68b112f64e6c1a23d61662224885fd976bdb21c7

In 2008 the Market Maker Options loophole for hiding FTDs is stripped away and the use of options falls off of a fucking cliff. It even looks like they possibly try to settle their FTDs after the change is announced on the 7th of July, but end up in a cycle before that September/October triple-witching windows rears it's ugly head.

Welborn finds that, “**settlement failures fall from 0.11% in the second quarter of 2008 to 0.02% in the last quarter of 2008**. For the subsample of stocks with settlement failures, this ratio falls from 0.44 to 0.18. These differences in the overall FTDs and FTDs as a percentage of shares outstanding before and after the rule change are statistically different. Consistent with these differences there is also a statistically significant drop in the average percentage of stocks on the Threshold List from 0.05% to 0.01% per day.” (Welborn p. 37-38)

“eliminating the OMM Exception reduced FTDs by 35%-39% for optionable stocks” (Welborn p. 27)

“Prior to the financial crisis, the global OTC derivatives market grew strongly and persistently. Over the ten-year period from June 1998 to June 2008, the market’s compounded annual growth rate was 25 percent. The total notional amount outstanding reached its peak of **$673 trillion in June 2008**, but just six months later it had fallen to below $600 trillion in the wake of the financial crisis. Since then, the market has stayed about 10 percent-13 percent smaller than it was at its peak. In **December 2010, the total notional amount outstanding was $601 trillion**.” (clevelandfed.org)

Market Makers lose the exemption that allows them to hide FTDs in the OTC options market and six months later the OTC options market loses $73 trillion in value. That six months also includes the 2008 financial crash, but 2 years later the OTC options market is still only worth $601 trillion. The growth rate from “June 1998 to June 2008” was “25 percent” while the growth rate from the end of 2008 to the end of 2010 was a whopping 0.0833%.

Looks to me like a lot of that $73 trillion in options could have been hiding some FTDs. Even just 1 percent of those options being used for FTDs is still $730 billion in options. I don’t even know what to say to that.

**How was Kenny G doing in 2008?**

“Citadel lost $8 billion of its clients' assets in 2008 with a 55% loss” (businessinsider.com)

Huh, I would have thought Kenny would have been poised to make a ton of money during the 2008 crash. He did well during the 80s crash and the early 2000s crash. What was special about this crash?

https://preview.redd.it/2bld2eezyvk91.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5480671fc37eebed276224fcdd0eafec1d3ed90d

Was Kenny hiding a huge amount of FTDs in the options market in 2008? Is that why his company started to implode?

Kenny G about the 2008 crash:

“...virtually every bank in America would have failed if the government had not intervened… every bank would have failed…”

Every bank was going to fail? I’m starting to wonder if it’s because of Mortgage Backed Securities or because every bank was swimming up to their eyeballs in FTDs. Both? Probably both.

“...we found ourselves fighting for our very survival…” - Kenny G

Was Kenny fighting for survival in 2008 because he was trying to clean-up a huge FTD mess? Did your options loophole get taken away from you, Kenny?

**PART 4 – FTDs, ETFs, and TRIPLE-WITCHING**

More of John Welborn. From Welborn’s Three Essays:

“I am also the first to document a statistical relationship between ETF put option open interest and FTDs and to analyze whether ETF FTDs are related to quarterly ”triple witching” dates, dates when equity index futures and options expire. I find that ETF FTDs spike on the third Friday of the third month of each financial quarter, a date associated with quarterly triple witching. This result establishes that options market activity increases ETF FTDs.” (Welborn p. 65)

The triple-witching effect:

https://preview.redd.it/gn3upgm8zvk91.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=afd2bf08c32106632d069638c7581d8a39ade5f8

There are more charts and graphs worth looking at in Welborn's Dissertation.

FTDs can't handle the Triple Witches

**T+**

Let’s go over T+ really quick. This has changed a lot and is honestly really quite confusing, so please let me know if I messed any of this up. The breakdown of important T+ dates:

T+2 – Money not received in T+2 results in a failure to pay. As far as I’m aware DTCC basically just takes a loan from the FED and sends a bill to the broker-dealer. The markets keep chugging. Too many failures to pay and the DTCC just cuts you off from the markets and I'm sure sues you for back-pay. They always get their money.

T+3 – OTC Shares not received in T+3 results in an FTD. Too many FTDs and the DTCC cuts you off.

T+6 – FTDs not received from Market Makers on ETFs in T+6 results in Reg Sho kicking in. Too many FTDs on ETFs making it past the 6 day mark and the DTCC cuts you off.

FTD5 – Once you, “have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency” then the security is added to the threshold list.

“Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days."" (sec.gov – Key Points)

FTD13 – If the FTDs last for 13 days then the Market Maker is forced to close. Or the DTCC cuts you off.

So let’s put together a nice calendar to visualize this. We won’t include any holidays. Also, the date when the security gets put on the threshold list is just an example. It’s based on several factors like a registered clearing agency having 10,000 FTDs or more per security.

https://preview.redd.it/3d5hd5wazvk91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c72216473eabacdf2ce0d1f97c768b1dce9cbe87

To summarize, you buy a share and it must be paid for in just 2 days.

If the share doesn’t arrive in your account in T+3 days then it results in an FTD.

Market Makers get T+6 days when it comes to FTDs on ETFs.

If FTDs reach a predetermined level than the stock is at risk of being listed on the threshold list.

After 5 days over the predetermined level the stock is put on the threshold list.

After 13 days over the predetermined level then forced buy-ins start kicking in.

**T+ and Triple Witches**

Back to the witching window.

So let’s use an interesting moment in GMEs history as an example - March 2021:

https://preview.redd.it/7x7r3uslzvk91.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8cef85fdaadff8a535b05e83098cceb4dc30f9ab

As the triple-witching date approaches, anyone still hiding FTDs in ETF options needs to roll those options over and kick the can as hard as possible.

The first triple-witching date in 2021 was March 19th. If you’re still holding on to ETF options that are hiding a mountain of FTDs on that date then you’re screwed.

If FTDs start piling up on the 19th then Market Makers are at risk of putting the underlying ETF on the threshold list. Let’s say there’s enough FTDs on ETFs on March 19th, then Market Makers would have had until March 25th to close their FTDs and keep the ETFs off of the threshold list.

If the ETFs get put on the threshold list after those five days then Market Makers would have had until April 6th to buy-in before being forced to buy-in by Reg Sho. Thus, our witching-window is from 03.19.2021 to 04.06.2021.

If you get caught in one of these triple-witching windows with too many FTDs, the ETFs you’re using to hide your shorts hit the threshold list for the 13th day, and marge knocks on your door… well, then you might just be fucked...

https://i.redd.it/bejvu6mszvk91.gif

Here’s a list of the triple-witching dates for 2020-2022:

https://preview.redd.it/jd0pd5vtzvk91.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7f6d2fb65ef6aada39cecebd01e3bb080a0dfe53

So, triple-witching dates can get really chaotic if/when Market Makers are scrambling to close out old FTDs and/or open new FTDs. The more FTDs they have getting closer to the triple-witching date the worse things are going to be. That’s why on the full GME chart, you’ll see spikes before the triple-witching date. For almost the past two years, GME has consistently spiked sometime before the triple-witching date before being crushed back down in price.

They’re closing some of their FTDs while the price is low which causes the price to rise. Once the price gets too high they create some new FTDs and flood the market which tanks the price. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat…

Here’s a GME chart with the triple-witching windows highlighted:

https://preview.redd.it/qykxs9lyzvk91.png?width=2741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0adf57bab8f0416072e3a8e38cde4fa85774dea

GME seems to have a pretty regular cycle of running up sometime before the triple-witching window before being crushed right back down.

Based on this chart I think Citadel could be in a lot more control over the price throughout the end of the year. I have some predictions towards the end if you want to read those.

The real problem is I think Citadel just got a MASSIVE cash infusion. Kenny G knows how to make fucking money. Fuck that guy.

Real quick check out this ETF growth over the years. Lots of room to hide FTDs:

https://preview.redd.it/xiaxekj10wk91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb996c208c5d23cd5d7d89713650bec3a980abb

Not a ton of data to go on, but it looks to me like ETFs really took off after 2008. Wonder why...

**PART 5 – 2001 – KENNY LOVES DRIVING CONVERTIBLES**

First, we need some more backstory on Kenny G. I hate to admit it, but Kenny’s a smart dude. He’s played the game on Wall Street longer than most and he’s made a shit ton of money doing it.

Kenny takes that $18 million from back in the 90’s and turns it into $4 billion by 2001. In 2001:

“Citadel is getting ready to launch a new U.S. long-short equity unit that will basically involve a classic stock picking business — quite a departure from its current approach.” (Meet Ken Griffin p. 5)

'long-short' - remember that too

“Paolo says Citadel engaged in “massive” short-selling, but Citadel, which declines to comment, bought only $3.75 million worth of the convertibles.” (Meet Ken Griffin p. 4)

Convertibles, again. I don’t know if you remember when I told you to remember “convertible arb”. Later in 2017, Kenny pays a pretty heft fine for what sounds to me like criminal convertible arbitrage.

**2017 – FASTFILL AND SMARTPROVIDE**

FastFill and SmartProvide are like the fancy PR name for Criminal Convertible Arbitrage.

“Citadel Securities LLC has agreed to pay $22.6 million to settle charges that its business unit handling retail customer orders from other brokerage firms made misleading statements to them about the way it priced trades.” (sec.gov – press release)

“But the SEC’s order finds that two algorithms used by Citadel Securities did not internalize retail orders at the best price observed nor sought to obtain the best price in the marketplace. These algorithms were triggered when they identified differences in the best prices on market feeds, comparing the SIP feeds to the direct feeds from exchanges. One strategy, known as FastFill, immediately internalized an order at a price that was not the best price for the order that Citadel Securities observed. The other strategy, known as SmartProvide, routed an order to the market that was not priced to obtain immediately the best price that Citadel Securities observed.” (sec.gov – press release)

https://preview.redd.it/71q1uhe60wk91.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b05750b8256a7b28b30421376f76c321fa263336

No wonder they got a $22 million fine. Wonder how much that really even cut into their profit margins though.

**CONVERTIBLE ARBITRAGE**

Kenny G loves a convertible. The wind in his hair… the siphoning off billions of dollars from the market in tiny pieces…

How does convertible arbitrage work? Once again hopefully, my diagram helps, here is an example using ‘common stock’ and ‘preferred stock’:

https://preview.redd.it/eu1kodh90wk91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cd7c474aaf9b0e25ed2860c20510bba2e003cfee

It can get more complicated then this, but this should be all we need to know for now.

No matter where the prices end up as long as they converge and become equal you make money. Almost sounds too good to be true. You can also play it the other way and Short the ‘preferred stock’ and go long on the ‘common stock’. This is sometimes also known just as arbitrage or short-long.

$5 in my example is an impressive spread. What about $26 vs about \~$13? A $13 spread would be an incredible opportunity.

How about a real-world example that happened just this month!

**PART 6 – APE COIN TAKES KENNY BACK TO HIS ROOTS?**

No offense to the AMC fans that are reading this, but holy shit…

https://preview.redd.it/4btcuefc0wk91.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2684b499819cc56088e5faee870a27929d68b9c8

APE stock was exactly what Kenny G ordered. Seriously... Damn… Not to get too into the conspiracies, but did Kenny G hand design APE stock? It’s like his dream arbitrage in a moment of need.

I hate to say it, but I think Citadel may have used AMC fans to pull off some insane convertible arbitrage.

What if I told you that Kenny G could have used AMC and APE stock to make off like the bandit he is with 300 million easy? What if I told you he could have made as much as $2 billion? Or possibly even more?

I believe that Citadel could have FTD’d the shit out of AMC up to and around it’s peak on August 11, 2022 where AMC stock reached $25.46

You might need some info on AMC and APE stock, if you’re like me and haven’t been following along on it that much. On August 4th, 2022 APE stock is announced through an 8-K filing.

An investor holding one share of AMC stock at the end of the day on August 19, 2022 would hold one share of AMC common stock and one share of AMC Preferred Equity aka APE in the morning on August 22, 2022.

AMC is currently authorized to issue up to 1 billion APE units with a maximum of 5 billion APE. Crazy…

“In this case, the preferred stock shares will trade at 1/20th of the price of the AMC stock at the time of the distribution.” (tastytrade.com, BATTISTA)

But, if AMC is worth around $20 and APE is basically the same thing then shouldn’t APE be worth ½ making them both about $10. From AMC’s own FAQ:

“Each AMC Preferred Equity unit (sometimes referred to herein as “APEs”) is designed to have the same economic value as a share of Class A Common Stock (the “common stock”).” (APE Dividend FAQ)

They even have the same voting rights. What’s the difference between APE stock and AMC stock? Besides the fact that you can’t currently convert them?

It’s basically just a stock split with a new ticker. What the hell...

**THE CHANOS CONVERTIBLE**

A dude named Chanos saw the writing on the wall:

“...""they are economically the same security, and there seems to be a lot of confusion about that,"" he said. Chanos pointed investors to AMC's APE FAQ webpage, which clearly states that…” (msn.com, Fox)

Here’s a chart on how Chanos could make $34 to $100 million easily:

https://preview.redd.it/ku1br7pl0wk91.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8a6e2974cde2668338af6813d353e3a8bf27b6db

**CITADEL AND AMC**

So, what could Citadel have done with something like APE?

There’s a possibility of up to about 188 million FTDs based on the over share vs float right after the APE split.

https://preview.redd.it/caxio74n0wk91.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e328249cadff83f04fa88a11fd770077223e3a6b

A difference of 1,540,125. Did they close out all of their APE FTDs already? Probably. They just made a shit ton of money.

So, Citadel FTDs a shit ton from August 9th to August 16th. On August 22nd they’re going to owe a bunch of AMC holders APE stock.

So, Citadel turns around on August 22, 2022 and starts buying up as much APE as they possibly could since it’s so much cheaper than AMC.

They buy AMC when it falls down to APE levels and return both the AMC and APE FTDs. Kenny drives his fucking convertible to more profits. Damn...

I put together charts for this. I’m going to include 2 of the 4. The first chart that I won’t include showed that with 50 million FTDs Kenny could have made around $300 million. With 100 million FTDs, I calculate that he could have made around $500 million pretty easily over the last two weeks.

In this chart, I show that 188 million FTDs on AMC over the past two weeks could lead to at least $1 billion in profit:

https://preview.redd.it/9mquekot0wk91.png?width=2765&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e914d6b38fa96ca135900c34efc60f6823a09a02

This chart shows that if Kenny could possibly push AMC even lower before settling then he could make even more:

https://preview.redd.it/n21vxofu0wk91.png?width=2731&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=05f6de8fad47b063ac0d5a50e542eb54f5352533

Damn, I wonder if Kenny did something like this/is currently doing this… His history kind of points to yes.

**PART 8 – CONSPIRACIES**

There are a lot of conspiracies. I think Kenny is still floating up his eyeballs in naked shorts of a bunch of companies. I also think most of Wall Street knows what’s going on. I think they choose willful ignorance and prefer to act blind to the problem. At least, until it blows up in their face, then the SEC and NSCC will swoop in and make changes to Reg Sho to stop some of the loopholes.

Wait until shit hits the fan like they always do. Usually they can fuck over the little guys in the blow-up though.

**DTCC**

I think that the DTCC knows about the FTD problem, but I don’t think they know the exact numbers. Their systems do allow for FTDs, but with Reg Sho in place there is a limit on how many FTDs can pile up in DTCCs internal systems.

I think the DTCC/NSCC and SEC are complicit by not closing this stupid fucking ETF loophole, but I think they also know what that means. When they closed the options loophole the economy immediately fucking crashed. Yeah, MBS were hurting us, but I think the Reg Sho update that removed the options loophole is what pushed us off of the cliff.

https://preview.redd.it/k7bzsyta1wk91.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33b4837a35054ab306b2c8f438498a66de53deb1

https://i.redd.it/2mj306gb1wk91.gif

Reg Sho came in fucking hot in 2008!

What’s the play here then? SEC updates Reg Sho to get rid of the ETF loophole and the economy definitely fucking craters? OR put your hopes in a guy like Kenny G? Wall Street was always going to put their money on the Citadels.

So, I’m Wall Street... Do I fuck the economy and let the little guy win? Or do I act blind to the FTD loopholes, hope that Kenny G squashes retail, and pray that I don’t have to enforce Reg Sho on Citadel’s ass?

https://preview.redd.it/ymri8k1j1wk91.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ff9795a0cf6a524341dc05fcfeea64bd7757287d

I think Citadel and any other Market Makers who have crazy amounts of FTDs are using Algos and Quants that cost billions. They have to have ways to ride the line perfectly. I think they’re drowning in FTDs, but I think they’re still playing the world’s worst and longest game of hot potato.

**Turning off the buy button was fucking bullshit though! Fuck them all for that alone.**

Fucking criminal.

**FTD LIMIT**

What is the limit to the FTDs? Maybe only their Algos and Quants know. But at some point their FTDs are going to explode out into the market… again...

Thanks for taking the time read all of this.

**TL;DR**

FTD’s are hidden in ETFs. DFV found treasure in GME. John Welborn handed out the map in 2013!

APE COIN smells just like how Kenny G made it growing up. In other words, Kenny could have made a fuck ton of money on AMC and APE stock in the past two weeks. Sorry, AMC fans. Shorters could have made a ton of money and if they're still short on AMC they also now have a much lower price to settle at.

Don’t make any investment decisions based off of this write-up! I’m a moron!

“Successful people tend to be very overconfident about what they know, and it leads to tragic mistakes. That will not be the final chapter in my career.”

AMC, meanwhile, recently debuted its preferred equity shares, or “APEs,” on the NYSE. The debut was marked by huge trading volume in both AMC shares and APE shares, leading to several trading halts due to volatility.

1413,Unusual Options Activity on Cameco Corp (CCJ): Sense or Nonsense?,"An article was published yesterday on Barchat about ""Investors buying a ton of call options in Cameco Corp (uranium stock)"".Cameco Corporation (CCJ) is the supposedly the world's largest publicly traded company, and it is based in Saskatchewan, Canada.

The rational behind this is Russia recently turning off the tap of natural gas supplies to Europe. The reaction, then, of the affected European governments is a ""sudden interest"" in nuclear power. Take for example, *France's Electricite de France (EDF)* just announced its commitment to restarting all its nuclear power reactors by winter. The expectation is that other European countries like Germany may follow suit and as you may have already seen or heard of the planned protests in Berlin and Leipzig.

Most of the calls purchased are out-of-the-money (OTM) calls with strikes 31 & 37. (A) The 31Call has a total volume of 22,774 and with the avg. price/contract at $3.00, this amounts to $6.83 million total investment.(B) 37Call --> 22,667Vol x 1.40 avg. price/contract --> $3.173 Million investment

The stock is currently at $28.82 which is already a 15% in the prior month. From (A) above, investors expect CCJ to rise 7.6% more than its current price.From (B) above, investors expect CCJ to rise 28.4% more than its current price.

# The financials and fundamentals:

The stock is said to have a high valuation. Well, even a quick look at the P/E ratio makes one quite uncomfortable like swimming on a cold lake. The *P/E ratio is 235.07* as per Market Watch. *For the quarter ended June 2022, they reported a total revenue of CAD $557.58M, net income = CAD$83.98M, and diluted EPS = CAD$0.21.*

Though, analysts forecast EPS of up to 1.05$ next year 2023, EPS could be $0.75 as some other analysts propose. At 1.05$, this is roughly 27x the current stock price. The problem, it seems, is that investors are expecting 43x earnings (anywhere from $45 - $50) at the $37 strike which has 22,667Vol and a $3.173 Mil investment.

The author of this article even goes ahead to point out that this play is some ""sort of greater fool theory"" play

**Can anyone speak to the validity of this buying interest? As an aside, another interesting unusual options flow are AEO puts, AMC puts and TWTR calls - trying to make sense of those ones too.**

1414,"I can understand holding a stock like Rivian (RIVN), the electric vehicle maker, but why hold B&M retailers like GME, AMC, and BBBY?","Money losing firms like Rivian Automotive have at least a catalyst going for them in that there is or will be a growing market for electric vehicles in the future (see California's outlawing of gas-engine cars by 2035) and they may be able to capture a part of that trend. And that is why holding for the long-term makes some kind of sense even for those stockholders who are currently underwater.

I don't see the rational for holding on to meme brick-and-mortar retailers like GME, AMC, and now BBBY. Most holders are seemingly wanting these as a short squeeze plays when in reality they are most likely the next Sears and Kmart. Those who held then ended up being wiped out in bankruptcy.

1417,"Getty Images (GETY): Recent deSPAC, still a microfloat (508k) and possible diamond in the rough","&#x200B;

[soon may the tendieman come](https://preview.redd.it/6sc2a8sgskm91.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ec4c7ea8d395f25569032d688576a32081282703)

&#x200B;

* I'm sure you've all heard of Getty images (GETY), they give people pictures and charge them for it or something. In my humble opinion it doesn’t work great \[[test query](https://www.gettyimages.com/videos/pawg-milf?assettype=film&phrase=pawg%20milf)\], but that’s besides the point. The real tragedy is that this stock’s beautiful setup might go to waste. A 508k float, 80+% short interest, high cost to borrow, and a loaded options chain.
* The company went public on July 25th as a deSPAC \[[ticker change announcement](https://investors.gettyimages.com/news-releases/news-release-details/getty-images-and-cc-neuberger-principal-holdings-ii-complete)\]. Fortunately, the SPAC had a lot of redemptions, leaving only a \~508k float and options. Following deSPAC, it ran to about $30 in a few days and stayed there for nearly a month, before dipping to \~$15 on a generally poor market and S1 jitters. Still, the float remains tiny \[[Bloomberg terminal screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/iPVuBZo.png)\], SI is still high, CTB is high (875%), and the options chain is loaded.

High open interest on OTM calls

* The entire chain is loaded up on this micro float for the September 16 expiry. As you move on up to $30, \~8000 calls come in the money \[[optionistics screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/QRwWvl2.png), [optionistics link](https://www.optionistics.com/quotes/stock-option-chains/GETY)\], meaning options sellers (usually market makers who don’t want to take an actual position on the stock) will likely hedge and buy shares to remain neutral as the options’ price accelerates. I’m sure you guys know this script by now, it worked for GameStop in January 2021, for AMC in summer 2021, and for System1 in April 2022. If this works out, MMs may end up buying 800K shares (more than the entire float) and we should get something of a pump, at the next strike of $35 we have \~3000 yalls being held, so another 300k shares. At \~1.1m shares, that’s more than double the current free float.

S1 EFFECT

* A possible hiccup on the free float is a potential S1 EFFECT coming which would increase the float, but if we look at recent deSPACs we can estimate that an EFFECT filing is likely at least two weeks away. You can see that in this chart \[[chart](https://twitter.com/BKAT23/status/1564985856825376769)\]. Bears have been celebrating the S1 filing and loading up on September 16 puts \[[puts side of chain](https://i.imgur.com/fbdBNz2.png)\], but I'm betting EFFECT comes after September mopex.

Sky high SI

* Short interest is also high, at >80% last I checked \[[SI #](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gety?mod=md_funds_majorHoldings),   Barron's\]. High SI is always good news on a play like this, it may result in better price action if this gets moving.

Max Pain

* Something interesting here is that max pain for the September 16 expiry is at the $25 strike \[[max pain screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Qr4yvfi.png), [max pain site](https://maximum-pain.com/options)\]. For those that don’t know, max pain is where option sellers can burn the most option buyers (puts and yalls) and make the most money. A lot of people think max pain theory \[[Max Pain Theory explanation on Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp#:~:text=The%20Maximum%20Pain%20theory%20states,of%20options%20to%20expire%20worthless)\] is bunk, but (anecdotally) I’ve seen low floats get pinned to max pain close to expiry somewhat often. If we hit $25 due to max pain pinning, then we may hit our escape velocity (calls come in the money, MMs hedge, price goes up)

Okay that’s about it

TLDR: microfloat (500k), with a loaded options chain, high SI (88% by last check), high CTB, can get pinned to $25 because of max pain, maybe it runs. Market sucks rn and lots of people are dumping speculative plays like this, so maybe it doesnt run

My position: 10 15c and 20 20c, I think it’s worth a lotto. If price goes up I’ll go further OTM.",2022-09-08 02:39:55

Robinhood Markets is launching an index to track the favorite stocks of its millions of predominantly young, social-media-savvy customers. The brokerage firm’s new “Robinhood Investor Index” will track the performance of the 100 investments most popular among its user base. Initially, the top five stocks in the index will be Tesla , Apple, Amazon.com, Ford Motor and meme-stock favorite AMC Entertainment Holdings. Robinhood said it would update the composition of the index monthly, offering a view into its customers’ changing tastes. In an unusual approach to constructing an index, Robinhood said it would weight stocks in the index by the “conviction” customers have in them, defined as the percentage of assets in a customer's portfolio devoted to a particular stock. 

That means that if many Robinhood users devote a large part of their portfolio to one stock, it would rank higher in the index, even if those users' holdings were relatively small. Robinhood tends to have less-affluent customers, with smaller accounts, than other brokerages.

Robinhood has experimented with sharing such data before. During the early months of the pandemic, it released hourly data on the popularity of stocks among its customers, which were aggregated by the third-party website Robintrack.net. The site became a popular way to track retail-investor activity until Robinhood shut off the data feed in August 2020, citing concerns that its data could be “misconstrued or misunderstood.”",2022-09-09 22:24:48

1432,(9/27) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, September the 27th, 2022-

# [Stock futures rise as S&P 500 and Dow try to bounce back from lowest levels since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/stock-futures-are-little-changed-after-sp-500-closes-at-lowest-level-since-2020.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 tried to bounce back from their lowest closing levels in nearly two years.
*****
> S&P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 157 points, or 0.5%.
*****
> The British pound rebounded slightly after plunging to a record low against the dollar earlier in the week. Sterling traded more than 1% higher at $1.087 per dollar after hitting an all-time low of $1.0382.
*****
> Treasury yields also came off their highs, boosting sentiment. The benchmark 10-year yield dipped nearly 5 basis points to 3.823%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after five straight days of losses for stocks, with the S&P 500 closing at its lowest level since 2020. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20% below its record high. The 30-stock average also posted its lowest closing level since late 2020.
*****
> Technical indicators show that the selling has been historic. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the 10-day advance decline line for the S&P 500 has hit a record low, meaning market breadth is at its worst level in at least 32 years.
*****
> The latest round of selling appears to have several catalysts, including an aggressive Federal Reserve and surging interest rates, which in turn have roiled currency markets. On Monday, the British pound slid to a record low against the dollar, unnerving investors on both sides of the Atlantic.
*****
> “Typically, US investors wouldn’t care too much about something like this, and especially more recently. And so this to me says that now there is this fear that is gripping investors a lot more than it did before. That in turn will lead to a capitulation moment where we really are at a bottom,” said Max Gokhman, CIO at AlphaTrAI.
*****
> On Tuesday, investors will get several new pieces of economic data, including September consumer confidence, August durable goods orders and July home prices. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned that the Fed’s six-month-long inflation fight will push the economy into a recession.

1433,I know you Tards have tunnel vision for GME and AMC but you really need to zoom out and consider loading the ever living hell out of this stock...,"Guys, just take a minute and zoom out your vision from stocks like $GME and $AMC and realize that $GOOG $GOOGL is at an extremely rare valuation right now. Even if it drops more from here you are getting a great price for it, I wouldn't pass this up...

Google is now trading for a 16x forward earnings and 11x EBITDA. Its not as sensitive to supply chain issues and inflation as other companies are. Google is literally the internet and not going anywhere and is a huge monopoly with no competitors even dreaming of coming close. It is also extremely oversold with an RSI below 30 and at 52 week lows. This is one of those All-In opportunities that you can feel proud of and brag to your dads boyfriend about.

Again... We are talking about freaking Google here, everyone uses Google and Google uses everyone. I  have been loading shares under $100. Anyways this is my opinion and not my financial advise yada yada

1434,"Famous short-seller Jim Chanos remains short AMC and long APE, AMC’s Preferred Equity Units. AMC issued APE in order to use the proceeds “to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase” existing debt. What is your current bias on AMC (-72%YTD)?","AMC Entertainment stock was sinking fast on Monday and had dropped more than 11% in trading after the theater chain announced a new distribution agreement to sell up to $1.4 billion worth of “APE” shares.

The so-called “APE” shares, or AMC Preferred Equity Units, have the same economic value and voting rights as a share of common stock. The idea was for AMC to use the proceeds from the sale of the new stock “to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase” existing debt, as it said in Monday’s filing. The APEs are even named after the meme traders that helped to boost the company’s stock price last year.

The market however soured at that idea, and while the APEs are up on the day, they’ve dropped 41% in value in the past month since the new stocks were first announced by Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron on August 22 at a price of $6, now sitting at $3.78.

Meanwhile, AMC’s stock itself over that same period has also dropped 21.1%.

While it was disclosed that up to 425 million shares of APEs would be sold, the announcement is a placeholder and does not specifically indicate how many will ultimately be sold or by when. Aron has previously argued that since the shares are going to already existing shareholders rather than going directly on sale, APEs would not dilute AMC’s stock value.

“With the creation of APEs, AMC is deeply and fundamentally strengthening our company. Given the flexibility that APEs will give us, we will likely be able to raise money if we need or so choose, which immensely lessens any survival risk as we continue to work our way through this pandemic to recovery and transformation,” Aron said in the letter announcing their creation last month.

1437,AVCT - Buy Potencial -,"If I understand correctly, the AVCT float has just been reduced from 126M shares outstanding down to 8.4M shares outstanding. The market cap is therefore 8.4M x $2.19 = $18M.

A reverse split results in a new CUSIP - all shares are recalled and new shares are issued. To my understanding this starts a 90 day FTD countdown on all the naked shorts as of today.

I suppose I could sell my shares now and help the market makers clear their FTDs, but I think I'll sit on them instead. Everyone wants to get out of a losing position, but sometimes when you get angry, you get focused.

What if AVCT shareholders DRSed their shares? All it would take would be 8.4M shares, $18M worth of stock and we could finally see what happens when you register the entire float and leave nothing but naked shorts in the brokerage system. GME and AMC have been trying to do this for two years. GME is making progress, but AMC is too big. AVCT is a plum by comparison.

1439,Can you ELI5 the Robust minus Weak factor?,"All the other 4 factors make sense to me. What you're doing is that you're taking *more* risk when you buy value stocks, when you buy small-cap stocks, when you buy stocks at all and when you buy conservative stocks. But because the market prices that excess risk, you get a higher expected return!

But the [Robust minus weak](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_port_form_op.html) factor doesn't make sense to me. From professor French website:

>The  portfolios are formed on profitability (OP) at the end of each June  using NYSE breakpoints. OP for June of year t is annual revenues minus  cost of goods sold, interest expense, and selling, general, and  administrative expenses divided by book equity for the last fiscal year  end in t-1.

To me, it should be the exact opposite intuitively. If you buy companies with weak profitability (I don't know, say AMC), they should have a *higher* risk than buying a better company with more profitability (say *Cinemark).* To me, it seems like a free lunch. You get to own better companies and get a higher return.

What am I missing? Can you explain how it makes sense?",2022-10-06 12:26:23
1440,New ETF (SJIM) plans to provide the inverse performance of investments recommended by CNBC’s Cramer,"An easier way to bet against finance personality Jim Cramer is in the works.

Tuttle Capital Management — which previously launched an exchange-traded fund betting against Cathie Wood’s stock picks — **plans to debut the Inverse Cramer ETF with the ticker SJIM**, according to a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1644419/000158064222005066/tuttleetfs485a.htm)

with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. If approved, the fund would provide investment results that are approximately the opposite of Cramer’s investment recommendations. 

The host of *Mad Money* on CNBC is an outspoken and polarizing figure in the finance world, known for his ardent endorsements of various stocks, with mixed results. In 2021, he praised Ark Investment Management’s Wood just before her flagship fund plummeted, and he also famously tweeted to buy AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. just prior to a 30% plunge.

“Jim’s mission has always been to encourage long-term investing and a balanced portfolio that includes index funds and individual stocks,” a CNBC spokesperson wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. “He regards *Mad Money* as his classroom and believes educating those who want to pick individual stocks through insight and experience is the best way to help them take control of their finances.”

The Inverse Cramer ETF would be actively managed, meaning financial professionals behind the scenes would monitor Cramer’s stock selections and overall market recommendations through Twitter or his television appearances, according to the filing. Fund managers would then sell those stocks short or use derivatives to produce a negative correlation to his recommendations.

If Cramer said he was negative on a stock or ETF, the fund managers would take a long position. 

Tuttle’s anti-Wood ETF, known by the ticker SARK, is up almost 90% since its launch in November 2021 and has attracted more than $350 million in assets. Tuttle was acquired by AXS Investments earlier this year.

And for those who do have faith in Cramer, Tuttle is also planning a **Long Cramer ETF, or LJIM, to bet on investments that Cramer endorses.** The filings did not disclose the fees for the two funds, but SARK charges an expense ratio of 0.75%.

I casually dabble in stocks and have been keeping an occasional eye on my investments, but recently I noticed I had a new stock called APE. I was confused since I don't remember buying this. I looked it up and discovered they seem to be related to old AMC stocks I held onto after making a profit when they were high a while back.

However... I'm very confused. I'm not well versed in stock speak to really understand what these APE stocks are or if I should sell them off since I technically seemed to have gotten them for free? Can anyone better explain this in a way I can understand?",2022-10-07 15:17:02

1451,Data shows AMC insiders got rich off retail traders," 

At least some people got pretty rich from [AMC’s two-year stock roller coaster](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/stocks), but it wasn’t the company’s super loyal, buy-and-hold investors known as the ""Apes.""

A Fox Business analysis shows that company insiders such as hedge funds, private equity firms, as well as board members, top executives and other big investors in the world’s largest movie theater chain sold a staggering $883.5 million in stock over the past two years at prices significantly higher than they are today.

According [to information from Dataroma](https://dataroma.com/m/ins/ins.php?t=y2&am=0&sym=AMC&o=fd&d=d), a website that tracks the portfolios of prominent investors and their real-time stock transactions, the most significant chunk of stock sales came from PE firm Silver Lake, hedge fund Mudrick Capital and Wanda America Entertainment, part of China-based conglomerate Wanda Group. Combined, they unloaded $782 million of stock.

But company officials, such as CEO Adam Aron, AMC’s chief financial officer and human resources chief, sold $101.5 million in stock in a series of particularly well-timed and lucrative transactions. These sales occurred after AMC joined the so-called meme stock craze in early 2021, and an army of retail investors began snapping up shares, pushing prices to the moon. Data also shows those company insiders have bought no shares on the secondary market in the past two years.

&#x200B;

Shares of AMC have since declined precipitously amid continued operating losses and after management recently announced a new plan to sell stock and dilute investors. Critics of the company say the insider sales underscore how big investors and company executives profited mightily from the loyalty – and some say the lack of market sophistication – of AMC’s predominantly retail or small investor shareholder base.

 These shareholders, who call themselves the ""Apes,"" began buying the stock based on tips and gossip spread on Reddit chat rooms and social media during the early days of the pandemic shutdowns. With the Fed keeping interest rates at near zero and printing money, stocks of speculative companies like AMC, computer-game retailer GameStop and retailer [Bed Bath & Beyond](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bed-bath-beyond-touts-progress-turnaround-plan-losses-widen) began to soar and remained elevated for months after.

The heavy Ape buying boosted shares and also allowed AMC to avoid bankruptcy following its own pandemic closures of theaters across the country. Management then used the elevated stock price to recapitalize and pay down some debt.

The Dataroma analysis also shows that management may have used the buying frenzy to get rich.

Case in point: AMC’s voluble CEO Adam Aron, who courted the Apes in social media posts and even private meetings, earned $43 million from his insider sales at prices well above the current single-digit value of AMC stock. Shares of AMC have fallen nearly 90% from their highs of a year ago.

&#x200B;

""Adam Aron, the AMC executives, and the board ran an enrichment scheme at the expense of individual investors who actually saved the company,"" said former hedge fund trader Marc Cohodes, a frequent critic of AMC management.

The market losses have been particularly acute for retail holders and others who bailed on the stock only recently. In fact, given the recent declines, only those investors who snapped up shares before or around the beginning of the meme frenzy when the stock hovered at around $5 and below would still be in the green. Shares of AMC (considering a recent stock split with the creation of a new preferred stock) closed Wednesday at a combined $7.49.

**DILUTING RETAIL WHILE AVOIDING BANKRUPTCY**

Insiders selling their stock is not illegal, of course. In fact, it is quite common in corporate America, where executives often cite ""estate planning"" for the sales. Executive compensation plans include significant amounts of stock option awards to senior management to align their interests with the interests of shareholders.

&#x200B;

Securities regulators mandate disclosure of these insider sales to help alert the investing public of how management may view the company’s business prospects. During much of the period of insider selling, AMC’s financials improved somewhat, particularly after several blockbuster theatrical releases such as ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" which broke box-office records earlier this year, generating $1.4 billion in worldwide ticket sales after 14 weeks.

&#x200B;

But AMC faced existential issues even before the shutdown. Headwinds include the rise of streaming, which continues to depress ticket sales, and a significant debt load used to finance past expansion. AMC continues to lose money, albeit at a slower clip, and its box office revenues remain below pre-pandemic levels.

&#x200B;

The tough operating environment recently forced one of its competitors, Cineworld, to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Aron has said that AMC will avoid a similar fate based on past recapitalization plans and a more recent one where he created a new preferred stock, known as the ""Ape,"" a homage to his loyal retail investor base.

&#x200B;

Surviving bankruptcy will come at a cost for retail holders, who comprise 90% of all AMC’s investors. The creation of the Ape is the equivalent of a stock split, and it sets the stage for the significant sale of stock and dilution of shares in the weeks to come.

&#x200B;

In SEC filings, and repeated in media reports, AMC has warned investors that its shares are over-valued based on standard metrics and to be prepared ""to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" Then, in late September, when AMC announced plans to sell as much as 425 million new Ape shares, Aron described the move as ""good dilution"" to help AMC avoid a fate similar to Cineworld.

&#x200B;

But his comments were widely criticized by analysts because such a term doesn’t exist, and dilution almost always leads to investor losses because it increases share counts even if it aids in a company’s survival. Because the Ape is a preferred stock and not common shares, the dilution doesn’t need shareholder approval, unlike prior attempts that investors voted down.

&#x200B;

""The situation retail investors find themselves in now is a reflection on management,"" Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese told FOX Business. ""AMC is completely wiping out and diluting its investors who have continued to flee.""

**INSIDERS CASHING OUT BIG TIME**

&#x200B;

And that’s after the insiders began cashing out of the stock. Take Mudrick Capital. Before the meme stock craze began, the New York-based hedge fund sold $26.7 million of its AMC stake in December 2020. The stock price then ranged from $2.50 to $3.40.

 

Then, in June, AMC disclosed in an SEC filing that it had entered into an agreement with Mudrick Capital, a large creditor and investor, to raise an additional $230.5 million. The company raised the money by selling 8.5 million shares of AMC stock at $27.12 per share.

The stock rallied on the news. The same day the sale was announced, the stock hit an intraday high of $33.53, Mudrick sold its entire stake for an undisclosed profit. Based on that stock price, Mudrick could have netted more than $40 million in the trade. A Mudrick press official had no immediate comment.

Silver Lake, which held a board seat, sold $534.8 million in AMC stock in the opening days of the meme mania, selling at prices ranging from $14 to $24 a share. A Silver Lake press official had no immediate comment.

Wanda Entertainment, another board member, sold $220.7 million of its AMC stake between Feb. 1 and March 20 of 2021 at prices of between $13.98 and $14.60, according to Dataroma. Wanda press officials had no immediate comment.

Several AMC corporate insiders appear to have timed their sales even better than the hedge fund traders, [the Dataroma report indicates](https://dataroma.com/m/ins/ins.php?t=y2&am=0&sym=AMC&o=fd&d=d). For instance, on June 3, 2021, just one day after AMC touched its all-time intraday high of $72.62, directors Anthony Saich and Gary Locke each sold shares worth $600,000 and $1.7 million, at $58.50 and $49.82, respectively. 

That same day, Daniel Ellis, the company’s senior vice president of global development; John McDonald, the executive vice president of U.S. operations; and HR chief Carla Chavarria sold $681,659, $1.71 million and $2.5 million worth of shares, respectively, at prices of $49.52, $56.59 and $62.67. 

Later that year, in November, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Sean Goodman made $6.6 million by unloading his stock at $39.21 and $40.36 per share. So far this year, Goodman has sold $3.4 million of his stock holdings at prices ranging from $18 to $22.98 a share. 

Aron, 68, has been CEO since 2015. He sold just over $42 million of his AMC holdings in three chunks beginning in November 2021 through January 2022 at prices ranging from $22.84, $30.86 and $40.52 a share.

&#x200B;

Aron disclosed his planned sales on an earnings call in August 2021 and said he would use the proceeds for estate planning purposes. On an earnings call in January 2022, he said, ""Those sales are now finished.""

1452,Data shows AMC insiders got rich off retail traders," 

At least some people got pretty rich from AMC’s two-year stock roller coaster, but it wasn’t the company’s super loyal, buy-and-hold investors known as the ""Apes.""

A Fox Business analysis shows that company insiders such as hedge funds, private equity firms, as well as board members, top executives and other big investors in the world’s largest movie theater chain sold a staggering $883.5 million in stock over the past two years at prices significantly higher than they are today.

According to information from Dataroma, a website that tracks the portfolios of prominent investors and their real-time stock transactions, the most significant chunk of stock sales came from PE firm Silver Lake, hedge fund Mudrick Capital and Wanda America Entertainment, part of China-based conglomerate Wanda Group. Combined, they unloaded $782 million of stock.

But company officials, such as CEO Adam Aron, AMC’s chief financial officer and human resources chief, sold $101.5 million in stock in a series of particularly well-timed and lucrative transactions. These sales occurred after AMC joined the so-called meme stock craze in early 2021, and an army of retail investors began snapping up shares, pushing prices to the moon. Data also shows those company insiders have bought no shares on the secondary market in the past two years.

Shares of AMC have since declined precipitously amid continued operating losses and after management recently announced a new plan to sell stock and dilute investors. Critics of the company say the insider sales underscore how big investors and company executives profited mightily from the loyalty – and some say the lack of market sophistication – of AMC’s predominantly retail or small investor shareholder base.

These shareholders, who call themselves the ""Apes,"" began buying the stock based on tips and gossip spread on Reddit chat rooms and social media during the early days of the pandemic shutdowns. With the Fed keeping interest rates at near zero and printing money, stocks of speculative companies like AMC, computer-game retailer GameStop and retailer Bed Bath & Beyond began to soar and remained elevated for months after.

The heavy Ape buying boosted shares and also allowed AMC to avoid bankruptcy following its own pandemic closures of theaters across the country. Management then used the elevated stock price to recapitalize and pay down some debt.

The Dataroma analysis also shows that management may have used the buying frenzy to get rich.

Case in point: AMC’s voluble CEO Adam Aron, who courted the Apes in social media posts and even private meetings, earned $43 million from his insider sales at prices well above the current single-digit value of AMC stock. Shares of AMC have fallen nearly 90% from their highs of a year ago.

""Adam Aron, the AMC executives, and the board ran an enrichment scheme at the expense of individual investors who actually saved the company,"" said former hedge fund trader Marc Cohodes, a frequent critic of AMC management.

The market losses have been particularly acute for retail holders and others who bailed on the stock only recently. In fact, given the recent declines, only those investors who snapped up shares before or around the beginning of the meme frenzy when the stock hovered at around $5 and below would still be in the green. Shares of AMC (considering a recent stock split with the creation of a new preferred stock) closed Wednesday at a combined $7.49.

DILUTING RETAIL WHILE AVOIDING BANKRUPTCY

Insiders selling their stock is not illegal, of course. In fact, it is quite common in corporate America, where executives often cite ""estate planning"" for the sales. Executive compensation plans include significant amounts of stock option awards to senior management to align their interests with the interests of shareholders.

Securities regulators mandate disclosure of these insider sales to help alert the investing public of how management may view the company’s business prospects. During much of the period of insider selling, AMC’s financials improved somewhat, particularly after several blockbuster theatrical releases such as ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" which broke box-office records earlier this year, generating $1.4 billion in worldwide ticket sales after 14 weeks.

1453,Is it time to enter the market?,"Kind of debating it - September and October I just don’t trade since they are historically bearish and I’ve taken big losses in those months before.

I’m thinking the election will send the market up significantly with a new president or incumbent wanting to price a sense of relief economically in their first year. 

I think it’s hard to argue against buying stocks like AMD that hold up the chipmaker market and is trading like 54-58 right now or something to that effect. 

But, I remember the narrative around the feb/march crash and then the money printer turned on.

Now we are in the same place price wise with insane rate hikes, inflation, more unemployment than what I’ve seen reported.

As well as a major war with Russia and Ukraine (although I think this point is more bullish than bearish as it seems we have seen the height of the war so far with talks of scaling down the military movement)

From a valuation standpoint, everyone is pretty undervalued besides AAPL and the energy sector. Even Tesla is trading just above 200-220 which is the all time low post split (may have even gone lower)

I do see meme stocks dying within the next 12 months. The amc/ape stock split is to thank for that along with intense dilution across all the meme names.

In summary, I don’t think it can get much worse before we see the government step in and push the market upwards. And I think the election will be the time when we see a true reversal. We are already in a recession by definition but since many institutions and self regulatory agencies tend to view a recession by differing parameters, it’s likely the moment a recession is announced, we will enter a bull market since it will have been priced in.

1465,Jesse Livermore's 21 Trading Rules - r/Daytrading October 2022 Edition,"Jesse Livermore is widely regarded as the greatest speculator who has ever lived. Below are his **21 trading rules** that were relevant 100 years ago and will be for the next century. I've incorporated **the community's posts/comments from the past month** to demonstrate the timeless nature of these concepts. Enjoy!

# 1. Nothing new ever occurs in the business of speculating or investing in securities and commodities.

This is the day trader’s modus operandi: we wake up, scan the markets, prepare, and look for familiar price action, setups, or patterns to trade. Some traders watch a single instrument and become intimate with how it moves (#ES for example). Others stick to a basket of the same tickers, while another group trades whatever is moving that session.

We're all the same, however. Each trader is looking for high probability opportunities which have favorable reward-to-risk and are repeatable. **If you want to be consistently profitable, then you must be consistent with your actions.** Nothing new ever occurs once you've accumulated enough screen time.

Here are 5 strong trend days for the month of October. If you are a trend trader like me, your job was to **find a pullback or a consolidation breakout** and ride the continuation.

[October 2022 - The Trend is Your Friend Till the End](https://i.redd.it/fpgyfqs836x91.gif)

u/CrossFit_Jesus76 also shared a post regarding one of the most common and timeless patterns: [The Bull Flag](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/yf1axi/the_bull_flag_a_strategy_that_has_stood_the_test/).

# 2. Money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year.

This rule is a bit outdated. Back in Livermore’s time, day trading was just not feasible given the lack of technology, liquidity, exchange centralization, etc. However, there is truth that the lower the timeframe, the more difficult it is to generate a consistent return. Long-term investing is easier than position/swing trading, which is less challenging than day trading, which is less demanding than scalping.

In my opinion, this rule's sentiment holds true; Livermore is arguing that **not every chart is tradeable at every moment.** We have to be selective with when to put on risk. There are a number of traders in this sub, such as u/DarthTrader85, who don't trade every day. And u/thoreldan agrees that flat is better than red.

Speaking of selectivity, u/oh_crap_Bears had a great comment where he said that [a lot of day trading is noise, and our job is to identify what is worth trading.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/yf2rn7/comment/iu1dprz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Definitely easier said than done.

# 3. Don’t trust your own opinion and back your judgment until the action of the market itself confirms your opinion.

**Our job as traders is to react and not predict.** It's okay to have an opinion and form a bias, but that should never conflict with what the chart is telling you. On Tuesday October 25,  u/ParisienneWalkways made a post regarding [Overbought Conditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/ydcza3/overbought_conditions/).

[October 25 - Daily close with near-shaven top after bouncing off support](https://preview.redd.it/dqkb5gy936x91.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=68065b94f8207d6d04a97a379b1ffed7927c3fd1)

Others and I commented that **$SPY 390 was a possibility** simply because we were in an intermediate uptrend on the 60m chart. Sure, the market could've dropped (and many people thought it would with all the bad earnings), but my interpretation was that price was above the rising 20 MA and had respected support. **The market would likely continue higher until there was reason to believe otherwise.**

# 4. Markets are never wrong – opinions often are.

**Chart don’t lie.** Candlesticks, tick charts, market profile, order flow etc. all show what buyers/sellers have done and are currently doing. With that information, traders can make educated guesses on what the market movers' intentions are. Price action is definitely king—it is the study of who is in control: Bulls vs. Bears.

**Remember that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.**

# 5. The real money made in speculating has been in commitments showing in profit right from the start.

Some of the biggest moves rarely give you a second chance for entry. Once they go, they are gone. This is why it can be dangerous to chase momentum moves; where do you put your stop if price hasn't pulled back yet? A late entry could mean getting stopped out during a normal retracement. You can get the direction right, but still get shaken out. **Timing is everything.**

Here's a trade from u/Advent127 where $AAPL printed 10 x 5-minute green candles in a row after bouncing off support. He explains [his TTO strategy in this informative post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/ygla55/how_to_properly_get_in_on_a_trend_day_and_not/)

[$AAPL 10 consecutive 5-minute bars off a strong bounce](https://preview.redd.it/pkve4bxa36x91.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8ac47234844e6577cdac506db0de69ff9f43e291)

This is another beautiful chart of $RIVN from October 14. After wicking through and rejecting the $30 whole number, the consolidation base broke down and led to 8 red bars in a row. There was no pullback on this timeframe as sellers **grinded the price down candle-by-candle.**

# 6. As long as a stock is acting right, and the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take profits.

This is probably one of the hardest things for day traders—**letting your winners run.** As u/daytradingguy put it so eloquently [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/y6mnmu/comment/isqafun/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

>*The bane of trader psychology- you are fearful when you have a small profit- fearful it will go away- so you snatch it too soon even when the price action indicates there should be more.*

# 7. One should never permit speculative ventures to run into investments.

One of the most important rules for day trading is to **never let an intraday position turn into a swing position.** That's usually the first step in letting a swing trade turn into a long-term investment. The daily charts below should hammer that point home.

**Off topic:** I shorted $AMC as a daytrade back in early August and was [berated by the Ape Army.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/wjj4xl/amc_short_extended_on_the_higher_timeframes_large/) I honestly feel bad for some of these people who have been brainwashed by Social Media circles and Influencers. Very similar with what happened to $BBBY below.

[$BBBY down 85&#37; from recent highs](https://preview.redd.it/hb3ksmvg36x91.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e7533f0cb7f337a37562dd41bd751df9a568d211)

# 8. The money lost by speculation alone is small compared with the gigantic sums lost by so-called investors who have let their investments ride.

Bagholding is a story as old as time. The Dot Com Bubble, 2008 Financial Collapse, 2022 Covid Correction. **Humans have hopium wired into our DNA.** Look what happened to Ackman's $NFLX bet where he lost $400m in just 3 months (-36%).

To avoid letting a loss snowball like that, day traders must **always use a stop loss!** This is crucial if you use leverage and/or trade volatile instruments. Here's a great post by u/donteathumans regarding [Risk Management 101.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/y0ppi6/risk_management_101/)

# 9. Never buy a stock because it has had a big decline from its previous high.

**Oversold can become more oversold.** 'Nuff said.

[$BA and $GOOG Oct 26 - Graveyard filled with knife-catchers](https://i.redd.it/9wtx7yji36x91.gif)

# 10. Never sell a stock because it seems high-priced.

**Similarly, overbought can become more overbought.** In this post, u/helipad668 blew up his account [shorting $FNGR during the recent parabolic run](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/xz5qqb/need_advice_from_from_experienced_traders_who/). It went from 0.62 to $9.36 in just two weeks. The RSI reading was probably off the charts; unfortunately, price action doesn't care about some arbitrary index.

# 11. I become a buyer as soon as a stock makes a new high on its movement after having had a normal reaction.

A 'normal reaction' means a pullback within the trend. In other words, Livermore likes to buy the new high following a countertrend retracement. Often these bounces occur at a prior resistance area, which has now become support.

[$AAPL Oct 28 - Pullback, break of HOD, and pullback](https://preview.redd.it/fp7ebwhj36x91.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89ca3f7547a7d4511c0840f4781ce67aa49979cf)

Become familiar with the fundamental price action pattern: **impulse, retracement, impulse.** Here is the short version in a downtrend.

[$SHOP Oct 7 - Impulse, retracement, impulse, retracement, impulse](https://preview.redd.it/l6k4l6zl36x91.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=958d1d1f30379703895c589b37f30e8169570f89)

# 12. Never average losses.

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a popular strategy for long-term investing. **There's no room for it in day trading.** Here u/stloft explains the [dangers of averaging down and martingale strategies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/ygcmz3/comment/iu88q5x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Imagine trying to dig yourself out of a hole by digging deeper. You double your risk—and potential loss—by doubling your position.

# 13. The human side of every person is the greatest enemy of the average investor or speculator.

Psychology is a very common topic in this subrredit. I think this image sums it up:

[The Man in The Mirror](https://preview.redd.it/27xx3sop36x91.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=71981367a7b1b91d1275d91546111368727c392b)

In this comment, u/FallForever3_14 breaks down the [importance of maintaining your mental edge](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/yce3ys/comment/itm9vq9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and why being a psychopath is good (not in those words).

# 14. Wishful thinking must be banished.

This is pretty straightforward. There's very little luck involved in trading. You are in complete control of your performance and results at the end of the day. **Trading is a serious business, and you must treat it as such.** The moment you start praying and hoping, you've crossed over to gambling.

Here are a few posts from both ends of the spectrum: those who doubled their accounts by taking big risks, and a few who blew up (also by taking big risks).

* [First time day trader, a week in, and made some huge profits, but concerned..](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/ygv5rs/first_time_day_trader_a_week_in_and_made_some/)

# 15. Big movements take time to develop.

I made [a post last month about consolidation bases](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/xmcp8j/become_a_pattern_recognition_machine_an_obsession/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and how they occur on all timeframes. Here is a 3-month base on $NFLX which recently triggered a breakout via gap.

[$NFLX 3-month consolidation base and gap breakout](https://preview.redd.it/6a44xjlq36x91.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57d2afa1b75c701fc2116d11113c6682fbaab409)

And here is a 2-hour consolidation which led to a midday breakout on $GOOG from Friday.

[$GOOG ascending triangle consolidation and breakout \(note the increase in volume\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj5m3gfr36x91.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=858d1b4574ccdd195149d6428b2bb2c5a975572e)

This is what Livermore means by *'big movements take time to develop.'* After a large run, price needs to *'rest and digest.'* This is done by going sideways or coiling. Once the boundary of the range is taken out, then it's off to the races—**the path of least resistance.**

# 16. It is not good to be too curious about all the reasons behind price movements.

Last Friday, there was a popular post asking [Why is the market moving up?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/yfpvq9/why_is_the_market_moving_up/) It gathered 245 comments! The simple answer, as u/SethEllis explained, was that aggressive market orders are taking out resting liquidity. This causes price to move. In other words: **there is a lot of institutional buyers hitting the ASK.**

As short-term day traders, we should avoid trying to find reasons why the market is doing one thing vs. another. What matters is the chart in front of us. Sure, it can be fun to 'predict' where the market is going tomorrow or in a few days from now. But to bet blindly on your opinion is not day trading. ***That's a gamblin'.***

# 17. It is much easier to watch a few than many.

Less is more. Trade the best and leave the rest. That means either sticking to one instrument or focusing on a narrow watchlist. There are thousands of stocks listed on U.S. exchanges and you only need to catch one clean move to make your day. **Sometimes there will be nothing to trade and that's OK.** Here's a conversation started by [u/10Drive](https://www.reddit.com/user/10Drive/) on why [being selective and disciplined can be such a challenge.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/yg15g9/really_having_a_difficult_time_being_content_with/)

Can you imagine how many amateur traders got sucked into trading $TWTR based on the impending buyout? **Good luck getting in between the algos playing ping-pong.**

[TWTR Oct 27 price action \(or lack thereof\)](https://preview.redd.it/tbcvnavs36x91.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d10994c64064550a01fa337c977d7d02d13e0bbd)

# 18. If you cannot make money out of the leading active issues, you are not going to make money out of the stock market as a whole.

Relative Strength (RS) and Relative Weakness (RW) are core concepts in swing/position trading (which Livermore did). In Bull markets, we should focus on going long the leaders; in Bear markets we should focus on shorting the losers. William O'Neil—the Investor's Business Daily legend—has trained a generation of investors using his CANSLIM methods which employ Relative Strength.

For daytrading, the same rules apply. When $SPY is in an uptrend, scan for stocks which are basing at HOD while the general market is pulling back. When the index breaks higher, **RS tickers should benefit from the tide that lifts all boats.** u/zanderdogz highlights [how institutional sentiment can be inferred](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/yce3ys/comment/itm62rh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from this behavior.

# 19. The leaders of today may not be the leaders of two years from now.

This is called **sector rotation.** The market has 'hot names' which money flows in/out of. Recently we have witnessed Crypto companies, pandemic stocks, oil, etc. get a lot of attention. Social media has definitely shortened the cycle and amplified these movements. Daytraders should focus on what’s in play for the next 6.5 hours and **ignore fundamentals and news.** We could care less if the company is on the brink of bankruptcy if the intraday setup is clean.

# 20. Do not become completely bearish or bullish on the whole market because one stock in some particular group has plainly reversed its course from the general trend.

Tech giants $META $GOOG $AMZN all missed earnings last week. Everybody was expecting the market to make new lows for the year. **It went in the opposite direction.**

[Mega Caps with recent Mega Gaps](https://i.redd.it/0ulgr0sbb6x91.gif)

# 21. Few people ever make money on tips. Beware of inside information. If there was easy money lying around, no one would be forcing it into your pocket.

The overwhelming majority of signal and alert services are scams. Back in Livermore's days, they lured you in with a free bottle of whiskey and an onion to put on your belt. Nowadays, snake oil salesmen have graduated to Discord servers, Telegrams, and WhatsApp groups. **Avoid at all costs.** There are no shortcuts to making money in the stock market. Similarly, **day trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme.**

Let me know what you think of these rules and your interpretation of them in the modern trading era. **Have a safe and happy Halloween!**",2022-10-31 12:40:59

# Final Comment

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash & cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

# Final Comment

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash & cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

Will Disney or Mattel (toy maker) or AMC / CInemark (CNK) (theaters), or some other company/stock/industry benefit from this?

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 7th, 2022.

# **Dow closes 400 points higher, but snaps four-week win streak on rising rate fears - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> Stocks rallied on Friday, but finished the week lower, as investors drew conflicting conclusions about what the latest payroll numbers mean for future Federal Reserve rate hikes.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 401.97 points, or 1.26%, to close at 32,403.22. The S&P 500 advanced 1.36% to settle at 3,770.55, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.28% to finish at 10,475.25.
*****
> All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow shed 1.4%, ending four weeks of gains. The S&P and Nasdaq fell 3.35% and 5.65%, respectively, to break two-week winning streaks.
*****
> October’s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday left investors divided, fueling some concern that the Fed will persist with its hiking campaign since the labor market added 261,000 jobs. Others interpreted the findings as a sign that the labor market is beginning to cool — albeit at a slow pace — since the unemployment rate rose to 3.7%.
*****
> “You see kind of a tale of two cities today,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “I don’t think the market quite knows how to gauge this employment number versus what the Fed signaled on Wednesday.”
*****
> Investors in recent days have struggled to decipher comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding whether a tightening pivot may come as the central bank fights to tame rising inflation and a strong economy. Focus also shifted toward next week’s consumer price index report. A drop in inflation could signal rate hikes are doing their job and fuel a potential shift.
*****
> In other news, hopes of a reopening in China pushed shares of U.S.-listed China stocks higher Friday, although the government hasn’t formally announced a pivot. Pinduoduo, JD.com and Alibaba shares surged.
*****
> Corporate earnings season also continued, with mobile payment company Block surging 11% after beating expectations. Carvana shared dropped 38% as it posted a wider-than-expected loss, while Twilio and Atlassian both plummeted on disappointing guidance.
*****
> Along with Thursday’s CPI report, investors are looking ahead to next week’s midterm elections.

> # Election Day and Day After Historically Bullish

> Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day. In the midterm elections since 1970, Election Day has been bullish with S&P 500, DJIA and NASDAQ (since 1974) all posting average gains. The day after Election Day, when results are in, is also bullish, but with even larger gains and a higher frequency of advancing days. Unlike the candidates on the ballots, the market generally only cares that the election is over as it has historically moved higher afterwards.

> # On the Other Hand

> Harry Truman is famous (among other things) for saying, “Give me a one-handed Economist. All my economists say 'on hand...', then 'but on the other...” And it's true. You rarely will see an economic analysis that doesn't couch one view with an alternative scenario, and you can't fault them for hedging their bets. Predicting the future is impossible, especially when it involves the direction of the world's largest economy.

> This morning's employment report also has a number of hands. At the surface, the report was better than expected coming in ahead of expectations (261K vs 193K). As shown in the chart below, this was the seventh straight better-than-expected print and the ninth in the last ten months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110422-Actal-vs-estimates.png))**

> To illustrate just how impressive this recent run has been, the chart below shows streaks of better-than-expected prints in non-farm payrolls (NFP). The current streak of seven is easily the longest such streak since at least 2000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110422-Streaks-of-Better.png))**

> While job growth in the US economy has consistently surpassed expectations this year, it is important to point out that the pace of job growth isn't accelerating. This month's print of 261K was actually the smallest monthly increase since late 2020 and is well off the peak readings seen in 2021 when the FOMC was maintaining its zero interest rate policy. To put this trend in perspective, in 2021 the average monthly change in NFP was 562K. In 2022, that average has declined to 407K, and in just the last three months, the average has been 289K. On the one hand, the job market remains strong. On the other hand, momentum has clearly peaked and there has been a trend of deceleration.

> # The Silver Lining of Another Fed Rate Hike

> The Federal Reserve (Fed) just raised rates by 0.75%, taking the federal funds rate to a target 3.75-4.0% range. This is the 4th consecutive 0.75% interest rate increase and comes as the Fed tries to get on top of inflation. The bond market has been anticipating this aggressive pace of tightening, and treasury yields have moved in sync. Short-term yields are a gauge of what investors believe is the path of monetary policy over the near future.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-3-picture-yields-vs-FFR-600x800.png))**

> The bad news is that markets don’t think rate increases are done, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell more or less suggested this in his remarks. Investors now expect the target policy rate to peak at 5% six months from now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-3-picture-implied-policy-rates-601x800.png))**

> # So, what’s the positive news?
> Well, interest rates are higher, and that means you can get a greater yield on bonds. And since the yield curve is inverted, with short-term yields higher than long-term yields, short-term bonds are potentially a very attractive option. They have less “duration” risk, in that they’re less sensitive to interest rate changes, especially if interest rates continue to move higher.

> Extremely short-term bonds are more attractive now than they have been in more than a decade and a half. The 3-month treasury yield is currently at 4.2% and the 6-month treasury yield is at 4.6%, the highest yields in more than fifteen years. These “ultra-short” bonds could potentially be used as a potential cash-like solution, especially if that cash is not needed in the immediate future.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-3-picture-yield-curve-shift-600x800.png))**

> # But Which Cash Solution?
> I mentioned above that yields have moved up as the Fed raised interest rates. But yields haven’t moved up in tandem across all the different types of savings and short-term investment vehicles out there.

> Savings accounts at some of the major banks are still paying interest rates well below the treasury yields I quoted above. And as the next chart illustrates, money market funds are also paying much lower yields, currently averaging about 2.9%. On top of that, they’ve started increasing fees. As Jason Zweig at the Wall Street Journal recently wrote, not a single U.S. money market fund was charging more than 0.18% in annual expenses at the end of 2021 – as of September 30th, the average expense is 0.39%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-3-picture-yield-changes-600x800.png))**

> CDs offer better yields and are gaining in popularity once again. However, the best rates (4% or more) tend to be offered by banks to their wealthiest customers, so-called brokered CDs which are purchased through brokerage firms.

> The downside of CDs is that they are illiquid, locking up money for a longer period. Moreover, if yields continue to increase, you could be stuck with a CD that pays out a lower rate of interest. Also, CDs are subject to state and local income taxes, unlike treasuries (and funds that hold treasuries), and you also must pay taxes on accrued interest for each year, unless it’s in a tax-deferred retirement account.

> This brings us to ultra-short-term bond ETFs. Now, you must be careful when picking one of these – being aware of the “duration” risk as well as the quality of bonds in the fund, i.e., “credit risk”.

> I combed through the universe of ultra-short bond ETFs and selected 8 that hold treasuries. The table below shows the expense ratios, yields, and effective duration for these ETFs. (Please note that this is NOT a recommendation to buy or sell any of these securities, and you must do your own research before doing so, given your unique circumstances.)

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11-3-21table-800x459.png))**

> If you notice, there are 3 different kinds of yields listed above. The first two are the 12-month yield and SEC yield, which are typically what’s shown if you pull up a site like Morningstar. These are both backward-looking yields. The 12-month yield is the sum of the ETF’s trailing 12-month interest payments divided by the last month’s ending share price (net asset value) – which is not helpful because interest rates were much lower over the past 12 months. The SEC yield is slightly better since it’s a little more recent – it divides the income received during the 30-day period that ended on the last day of the prior month by the share price on the last day of the period. The problem is the income received can vary from month to month, and it’s still backward-looking.

> The yield you want to focus on is the “yield-to-maturity”, which can be found on the issuer websites, and is best reflective of the future expected return. The average effective duration can also be found on the issuer’s website, and as you can see, these ETFs all have extremely low duration. This means they have very little interest rate risk, even as they offer very attractive yields. And since these ETFs hold treasuries, there is no credit risk (unless the US government defaults). There are plenty of ultra-short ETFs that I didn’t list here which have much more attractive yields, but they do tend to stretch more out onto the credit risk spectrum.

> A couple of interesting ETFs at the bottom of the table (tickers: TFLO and USFR) have practically zero duration risk. These hold “floating rate” treasury bonds that seek to take advantage of rising interest rates – they mature in two years, but the interest rate resets every week when the US Treasury auctions the 13-week treasury bill.

> We believe all these ETFs are fairly attractive options that can be used as potential cash solutions. Ideally, you can tier your cash to maximize the yield – with money market funds used for immediate liquidity needs (say, a week or two) and ultra-short treasury bond ETFs like the ones listed above for longer-term needs.

> The silver lining of an aggressive Fed is that now you can put your cash to work.

> # Typical November Trading Usually Bullish

> After a big October for the record books the first two days of November have taken it on the chin as the market hoped for more dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Initial bullish reaction to new dovish remarks in the written statement were countered by tough talk from Powell in the presser. Looked like war of the algos today. Let’s wait for the dust to settle over the next few days to see if November begins to live up to it’s bullish reputation.

> Being a bullish month November has seven bullish days based upon S&P 500, with four occurring on the first four trading days of the month. Although historically a bullish month, November does have weak points. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 exhibit the greatest strength at the beginning and end of November. Russell 2000 is notably bearish on the 12th trading day of the month; the small-cap benchmark has risen just ten times in the last 38 years (since 1984).

> # Best and Worst Performing Stocks Since Rate Hikes Began

> The S&P 500 is down a little more than 12% since the close on March 16th after Fed Chair Powell hiked rates off the zero bound for the first time of this cycle. We've seen 300 basis points of hikes so far, and today we're set for another hike of 75 bps.

> Looking at the S&P 1500, which includes large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps, the average stock in the index is down 7.1% since the close on March 16th after the first rate hike. As shown below, Real Estate stocks (REITs) have been hit the hardest by the rate hikes with the average stock in the sector down 20.6%. Communication Services stocks are down the second most with an average decline of 18.4%. Consumer Discretionary stocks have averaged a decline of 13.1% since 3/16, while Technology stocks are down 10.6%. On the upside, we've seen two sectors average gains since the Powell rate hike cycle began: Energy and Consumer Staples. Consumer Staples stocks are up an average of 5.6%, while Energy stocks have averaged a huge gain of 24.8%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/avgsector.png))**

> Below is a list of the stocks in the S&P 1500 with market caps above $2 billion that have done the best since rate hikes began back in March. PBF Energy (PBF) is up the most with a gain of 135.99%, while CONSOL Energy (CEIX) ranks second with a gain of 114.49%. Other notable stocks on the list of big winners include First Solar (FSLR), Constellation Energy (CEG), Shockwave Medical (SWAV), Enphase Energy (ENPH), Lamb Weston (LW), H&R Block (HRB), TreeHouse Foods (THS), Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Albemarle (ALB).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/bestperf.png))**

> On the flip side, below is a list of the stocks with market caps still above $2 billion that have fallen the most since the rate hike cycle began. Leading the list is portable generator maker Generac (GNRC) with a decline of 62.45%, followed by two more stocks down more than 60%: Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) and Neogen (NEOG). Other notables on the list of rate-hike losers include Under Armour (UAA), Align Tech (ALGN), Meta Platforms (META), Carnival (CCL), Kohl's (KSS), Expedia (EXPE), Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), VF Corp (VFC), AMD, Paramount (PARA), and Yeti (YETI).

> Stocks usually bottom before EPS, jobs, and GDP start to improve. Time after time we've seen it (but note it didn't work during the Tech bubble). The bottom line, stocks sniff out better times and rally in the face of bad news.

> # Record Decline in Mortgage Apps

> As mortgage rates continue to press higher with Bankrate.com's 30 year national average for a fixed rate loan hovering well above 7%, high frequency housing data continues to show no signs of relief. The latest mortgage purchase reading from the Mortgage Bankers Association released this morning showed the lowest level of applications since the start of 2015. As we mentioned in today's Morning Lineup, that would imply further significant declines in new and existing home sales data to come.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110222-MBA-1.png))**

> Refinance applications are even worse. Given homeowners would be refinancing at some of the highest rates of the past few decades, refinance applications were up modestly week over week, although that is far from enough to lift it off of the lowest levels since August 2000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110222-MBA-2.png))**

> On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, purchases tend to peak in the late spring followed by a gradual decline through the end of the year. While mortgage activity has fallen off of a cliff this year, the drop has followed the usual seasonal pattern. What is amazing about this year is just how large of a drop that has been. Whereas 2022 started with purchase apps coming in at some of the strongest levels of the past decade for the comparable weeks of the year, the opposite is true today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110222-MBA-3a.png))**

> Although purchases have followed their seasonal pattern, the chart above does not do justice in showing how large of a decline it has been off of the annual peak. It has been nearly half a year (25 weeks) since applications hit their seasonal high, and in that time, purchases have been essentially cut in half. Relative to the 25 weeks after each other annual high since 1990, 2010 was the only other year in which there was a similar decline. However, that year comes with a caveat that the expiration of special homebuyer tax credits lent to a particularly strong home-buying season. Similarly, a change in mortgage disclosure rules in the fall of 2015 resulted in a seasonal peak occurring unusually late in the fall of that year, so 25 weeks later extended out to the following year. Given that, purchases were actually higher in the 25 weeks later; the only year in which that is the case. In other words, caveats aside, no other year in the history of this data has seen as sharp of a decline in homebuying/mortgage origination activity as this year.

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash & Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

|Expected Minimum Return|1.09%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|1.72%|
|Standard Deviation|13.11%|

&#x200B;

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

# Risk Analysis - Market Risk

The FED has raised rates to 4%, we will factor in a 4.50% rate instead.

Risk Free Rate is 4.15%

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash & Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

1479,"AMC Stock: The Shorts Are Winning, but Their Gains Could Be Short-lived",,2022-11-05 21:30:28
1480,"Expected Moves this week. QQQ, SPY, Palantir, Disney, Rivian, Workhorse and more.","## Market View

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by about 3.3% last week, erasing most of the gains made the week before. The majority of the move lower came immediately after a slightly more hawkish-than-expected press conference from Jay Powell following the FOMC rate change and statement. The market rallied on Friday and kept last week’s selloff from being even worse.

The 3.3% move lower was more than the 2.5% move options were pricing. The market has been moving more than options were pricing fairly consistently over the past month. Despite that, vol continued to trend lower, with many of the big earnings reports, plus the FOMC decision now out of the way. However, the election looms this week and that could keep a bid on options for the next few days. 30 day IV in SPY is about 24, with realized vol (actually moves) over the past month around 27. (for reference, realized vol for the past year is around 23, so 27 the past month means the market is volatile, even for 2022)

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of about $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 25. Its lowest levels since mid-September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher. The reasons why are numerous and unimportant is some ways, but from a trading perspective, it means that debit call spreads that buy ATM and sell upside strikes are more favorable than they have been in recent weeks (not to mention they are lower IV overall).

The economic calendar this week has an important CPI number, and of course, the mid-term elections are on Tuesday, with reactions beginning with Wednesday’s session.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.6%** (+/- $10)
* QQQ **3.4%** (+/- $9)
* IWM **3.1%** (+/- $5)
* DIA **2.3%** (+/- $7)

# [Stock futures nudge higher as Wall Street awaits U.S. midterm elections](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were slightly higher Tuesday following a winning day for markets as investors looked ahead to U.S. midterm elections.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 52 points, or 0.16%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.18%. Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.47%.
*****
> Shares of Lyft fell nearly 20% premarket while Take-Two Interactive and Tripadvisor slumped more than 18% each after reporting disappointing quarterly results.
*****
> The moves come after a day when all major indexes notched a second straight positive session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher by 423.78 points, or 1.31%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.85%.
*****
> Investors are awaiting Tuesday’s midterm election results. They will determine which party controls Congress and steer future policy and spending. Market participants will watch whether Republicans take back the House of Representatives, the Senate or both.
*****
> “The financial market reaction to a Republican win should be muted, as the House outcome is already widely expected, and the Senate outcome makes less of a difference to policy outcomes if Republicans control the House,” Goldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius wrote in a Monday note.
*****
> “A surprise Democratic win in the House and Senate would likely weigh on equities, as market participants might expect additional corporate tax increases,” Hatzius added.
*****
> Wall Street will also closely watch Thursday’s consumer price index report for the latest data on how much the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have tamed high inflation. This reading could also signal the central bank’s path forward – another hotter-than-anticipated report could embolden the Fed to raise rates aggressively in December.
*****
> Earnings season continues this week. On Tuesday, Lordstown Motors, Lucid Group, Walt Disney and AMC Entertainment all report their latest quarterly results.

> Shares of Lyft fell nearly 20% premarket while Take-Two Interactive and Tripadvisor slumped more than 18% each after reporting disappointing quarterly results.

> The moves come after a day when all major indexes notched a second straight positive session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher by 423.78 points, or 1.31%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.85%.
*****
> Investors are awaiting Tuesday’s midterm election results. They will determine which party controls Congress and steer future policy and spending. Market participants will watch whether Republicans take back the House of Representatives, the Senate or both.
*****
> “The financial market reaction to a Republican win should be muted, as the House outcome is already widely expected, and the Senate outcome makes less of a difference to policy outcomes if Republicans control the House,” Goldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius wrote in a Monday note.
*****
> “A surprise Democratic win in the House and Senate would likely weigh on equities, as market participants might expect additional corporate tax increases,” Hatzius added.
*****
> Wall Street will also closely watch Thursday’s consumer price index report for the latest data on how much the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have tamed high inflation. This reading could also signal the central bank’s path forward – another hotter-than-anticipated report could embolden the Fed to raise rates aggressively in December.
*****
> Earnings season continues this week. On Tuesday, Lordstown Motors, Lucid Group, Walt Disney and AMC Entertainment all report their latest quarterly results.

1484,Why I'm bullish on Curiosity Stream ($CURI) - Deep Value Play (DD),"Summary:

1. Curiosity Stream is a speciality SVOD (Subscription Video on Demand) that specialises in factual content. Think “Netflix for documentaries.”.
2. The market cap of Curiosity Stream is 64M. However, it has \~66M in net current assets. Priced to go bankrupt but is highly unlikely to go bankrupt.
3. It has further upside potential due to its unique business model and moats.

Balance Sheet Analysis

I’m starting with a Balance Sheet Analysis first as the current valuation can be justified just with the balance sheet:

66M in net ""cash""

Curiosity Stream has 91.84M dollars in current assets and 25.65 in current liabilities. This excludes unearned revenue liability as it's a non-cash account - CURI ""owes"" its customers 22M worth of content, and it services this liability simply by continuing to operate the service. This means they have 66.19 in net current assets.

8M in valuable equity

As of Jun 2022, Curiosity owns 8M of stock in a private start-up called Nebula. Curiosity also has the option to buy up to 25% of Nebula (Valuing Nebula at 50M in 2021). About Nebula: Nebula is a creator-owned streaming site with more than 500k subscribers (reported 2021). The top YouTubers are on Nebula, with a cumulative reach of 200M subscribers. On Nebula, you get to watch videos from your favourite YouTubers first, with extra content and exclusive content only found on Nebula. This is an excellent value proposition from the customer side. Nebula is already profitable, according to the CEO. With growing paid subscribers, Nebula's value has most likely increased in 2022, which is not reflected on the balance sheet. Nebula’s Youtubers have a combined reach of 200m and are interested in factual content. Netflix, for example, has about 200m+ subscribers. CuriousityStream is the only outsider investor, and even VCs cannot get an allocation. Curiosity Stream only managed to get an allocation as it has worked together with Nebula for multiple years, building the relationship; To put simply, this means the stock is precious. Most importantly for CURI, because of this partnership - you have top YouTubers constantly marketing Curiosity Stream and Nebula Bundle. CURI has a straightforward way to grow its subscribers.

78M in content assets

As of Jun 30, 2022, CURI has 78M in content assets, valued at cost. Management believes it is worth 5x as much (390M). Usually, I would ignore intangible assets as it is hard to value; however, in the streaming wars, content is precious to prominent players such as Netflix, Apple, Disney & Amazon (who routinely spend 100m for a single title). I see a scenario where CURI can better monetise these libraries by licensing them out or outright selling them at cost. They do currently license their content out already. CURI can generate 71M in revenue in 2021, and LTM - 85.96M, so their ability to monetize their library seems to be improving quickly.

Selective Book Value calculation

Selecting for the most tangible assets, excluding everything else (other intangibles, PPE, etc.). Results in 152M of Book Value

66M in net current assets **(this already covers the market cap)**

8M investment in Nebula

78M in the content library.

With no debt, the current market cap of around 64M implies at least of 100% gain just by the book value.

Will CURI go bankrupt?

Given that the CURI market cap is valued at less than its current assets, the market implies that the CURI sum of future cash flows will be slightly negative. i.e. it will go bankrupt.

Will CURI go bankrupt?

**In my opinion, no, and I have three reasons.**

Reason 1: Improving FCF

Firstly, the management has guided positive cash flow in 2023. Should we believe them? Looking at the Cashflow Statement, we can see that the free cash flow margin has steadily improved from -300% to just -26% last quarter. CURI is on the verge of producing positive cash flow; if that happens in 2023, there is 0 chance of bankruptcy.

Reason 2: Management

Secondly, the Chairman of CURI, who owns 40% of CURI, is John Hendricks - the founder of Discovery Channel. He has a net worth of [800m](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/ceos/john-hendricks-net-worth/), with his real estate portfolio worth 280M by itself. Let's assume CURI somehow does run out of cash. If Hendricks wanted to, he could buy out the whole company with 1/10 of his net worth. Indeed, he does not need to take such drastic action; he can inject a small amount of cash into the company to tide it over hard times if more capital is genuinely required. This is his passion project anyway; he left Discovery because he disliked that it made more reality TV shows rather than factual content.

Reason 3: Unit Economics

Thirdly, the unique thing about the SVOD industry is there is little to no marginal cost to serve media. If it comes down to it, management can cut advertising, lay off employees except for the technical stuff, and just let the servers stream videos. This is a structurally profitable company. Management is trying to grow its way to profitability. However, they can quickly reduce costs as well to reach there.

Potential Risk and why is it so cheap?

Every once in a while, the market provides a free lunch, and this appears to be one. If we can explain why we have the free lunch, we can build conviction in the investment.

Bear Argument related to the company

The primary bear argument is that the company is unprofitable and will remain unprofitable. This means it will go bankrupt or potentially need a capital raise.

However, the reason why CURI is unprofitable is that the company was in growth mode. Since 2022, management has been committed to reaching positive cash flow by 2023; as a result, the operating loss has decreased significantly in Q1 and Q2 2022.

Upon further analysis, the operating loss is primarily driven by the amortization of their content assets, which is a non-cash expense. From CURI, 2021 10k:

>Company amortizes content assets on an accelerated basis in the ***initial two months*** after a title is published on the Company’s platform, as the Company has observed and expects more upfront viewing of content, generally as a result of additional marketing efforts. Furthermore, the amortization of original content is more accelerated than that of licensed content. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis and the estimates related to these **factors require considerable management judgment**. The Company continues to review factors impacting the amortization of content assets on an ongoing basis and will also record amortization on an accelerated basis when there is more upfront use of a title, for instance due to significant program sales

They have a fiduciary duty to estimate how much their content ""value"" has reduced each quarter. There is undoubtedly a shelf life to a piece of content; news or sports, for example, have an extremely short lifespan. However, documentaries have a long shelf life, as facts don't change. Also, this accounting is tricky, as the actual video content has not ""degraded"" in quality, unlike machinery or tangible assets. The incremental customer can watch the video at the same quality. As an investor, you can believe they are being conservative, accurate or liberal with their estimations; **I think that the best way is to avoid the income statement totally and look at the cash.**

Looking at the cash flow statement, you can see that FCF remains roughly constant. On the other hand, revenue is increasing rapidly. Therefore, the FCF margins are improving to a large extent. Curiosity stream is instead on the verge of FCF profitability.

Bear Argument related to technical reasons

1. Lack of momentum. CuriosityStream is ""uninvestable"" in the current market. It is a SPAC, Growth, Tech, Unprofitable, Micro Cap, COVID, Streaming stock. In 2022, these are not the characteristics you want. This explains why the market hates CURI.
2. Microcaps are known to be illiquid and highly risky.

Rebuttal: Momentum can change when the economic sentiment changes or more coverage. Past price performance does not indicate future performance. Microcaps are also where you can potentially get the most gains.

Bear Argument related to the product

>""Documentaries are undifferentiated & easy to copy by major SVODs like Netflix"".

Rebuttal: Documentaries are easier to make and less differentiated than big flashy blockbusters. However, this doesn't mean CURI will fail. I argue that focusing ONLY on factual content is the selling point; **reducing the types of content is a feature, not a bug**. There exist niche audiences that do enjoy documentaries, parents who want to buy this for children, and employers purchasing this for their employees...these people wish to buy a pure-play documentary service.The real competition for CURI, I believe, is against other pureplay factual SVODs like Kanopy, Wonderium, MagellanTV, and HistoryVault. My thesis is that CURI currently has escape velocity and is one the most prominent player in the pureplay factual SVOD market - they win by being first, more extensive and faster.

>2) I can find documentaries on youtube for free.

Rebuttal: The free Youtube documentaries argument doesn't hold, as the documentaries found on CURI are premium long-form documentaries. All SVODs are generally trying to produce premium content; if the youtube argument was valid, then we would all be unsubscribing to Netflix and watching free web dramas on youtube. Secondly, CURI is making FAST (Free Ad-Support Streaming TV) channels that are free and ad-supported. On a side note- related to the youtube argument - CURI is leveraging its partnership with Nebula to market those exact free Youtube factual content.

>3) CURI documentaries suck.

From my personal experience using the product, it is a mixed bag. I'd agree that some content is pretty bad, but even Netflix or Disney have duds in their libraries. However, there are also real gems like the Titans of Wall Street and acquired content from the BBC. Over the long term, I believe with more capital, economies of scale, data and expertise, CURI will be able to produce and acquire higher-quality documentaries.

Ok, it's cheap, so what?

At this point in the article, the current valuation can already be justified with the balance sheet and has gone through the risk and bear arguments without discussing the operational business & income statement, which cover the downside. However, further analysing the business case - CURI does have some good qualities that allow us to hypothesize that CURI might be a good business.

High Revenue Growth

1. Streaming is eating into Broadcast and Cable. Infact, [Streaming overtook Broadcast and Cable for the first time](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/streaming-viewership-overtakes-cable-tv-first-time-rcna43704)
2. Within Streaming - the rise of bundling & MVPDs like Roku, Amazon, and Youtube TV - CURI is an easy, inoffensive and cheap value-adding compliment for people's other SVODs or non-video services.

High Gross Margin

Negligible marginal costs after the initial upfront cost mean ""Sofware-like margins"" without sky-high valuations. Superior gross margin compared to industries selling tangible goods.

Compared to the other SVODs:

1. Documentaries have longer ""shelf-life"" - more timeless (AKA less content spend)
2. Easy to translate and internationalize to multiple languages
3. Educating instead of brainless content - e.g. employers buying subs for employees, homeschoolers, Schools, and parents buying for their children. CURI already has a small portion of their revenue, but this can grow much more.

High Operating Margin

1. Pure play streaming without the legacy networks & personnel overhead of Cable & Broadcast that are declining. No need to avoid cannibalising their cash cows, unlike Para, WBD, AMC

Moats

Why Curiosity Stream can defend profits:

1. ""Unattractive"" moat - filmmakers, management and Hollywood studios may see documentaries as unattractive & dull compared to the next action flick. The industry has moved away from Factual content to Reality TV. Hendricks, the founder of Curiosity, started it in the first place because his previous company Discovery Channel began to do more reality TV. So as the rest of the market increasingly goes in one direction, CURI becomes more differentiated.
2. Management & Culture. The founder of Curiosity is the founder of Discovery Channel - lots of networks. Strong undivided self-imposed focus on factual content. Related to point 1.
3. Developing Brand. Not a moat yet, but no doubt they want Curiosity to be the best place to get documentaries on the Web. In the 2000s - the cable brands were Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, and National Geographic. I think the 2020s and beyond can belong to CURI.
4. Network Effects/ Economies of scale. More subscribers mean CURI acquires/produces more documentaries which in turn means more and better documentaries. Why subscribe to a service with less content? Curi is a business that naturally compounds value over time.
5. Differentiated customer acquisition. Strategic partnership with Nebula. Nebula's YouTubers have 200 million subscribers in cumulative reach; these subscribers love factual content. Other factual SVODs don't have access to this.
6. Switching Cost. People are lazy/forget to cancel a subscription.

A note about moats in the Entertainment Industry

They say content is king. However, this is untrue generally, as content production is undifferentiated. Anyone with a camera and a good eye can technically make films. Content is a kingmaker, and content distribution - originally cinemas, cable and broadband- is a more stable competitive advantage. In the modern age, SVODs or platforms like MVPDs are the gatekeepers that have the distribution to reach customers.

In conclusion, CURI has $152M in book value, of which 66M is pure cash, while its equity is only 64M at the current market cap. Even if you’re sceptical that CURI can ever generate serious money, it is already severely underpriced. It is not hard to imagine it will break even. Furthermore, CURI market positioning is solid; there is upside for free if you believe CURI can continue to grow and generate significant cash.

# [Stock futures inch higher as investors watch midterm results, await inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures inched higher Thursday as investors awaited new inflation data and eyed U.S. election results.
*****
> Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures added 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.2%.
*****
> It follows a day of losses with the Dow dropping 646.89 points, or 1.95%. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 shed nearly 2.5% and about 2.1%, respectively.
*****
> The declines came amid uncertainty stemming from U.S. midterm elections. The market had hoped Republicans would take sweeping control of the House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday – a situation that would create gridlock in Washington, D.C. Instead, key Senate races in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada remain tightly contested. Indeed, the Senate race between Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent, and Herschel Walker will head to a December runoff.
*****
> Stocks’ suffering worsened late Wednesday after crypto exchange Binance said it’s backing out of plans to acquire its rival FTX. This dragged down the tech sector and pulled bitcoin’s price to lows last seen in 2020.
*****
> Lack of clarity around the election, as well as uncertainty around incoming October consumer price index data and corporate earnings reports were the drivers around the selloff, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> “Those three things are leading to uncertainty,” he said. “And, as everyone knows, markets really don’t like uncertainty.”
*****
> October’s CPI report, due Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is the next focal point for investors. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect that headline CPI rose in October by 0.6% from September, or 7.9% over a year ago. It’s a key report for the Federal Reserve, which will meet again in mid-December.
*****
> Weekly jobless claims are also due out on Thursday morning.

1489,"Why do ""crap"" , no earnings type companies rally the most during rallies?","ARKK, SNAP, CVNA, etc all rallied in double digits over the last few days, some on Friday I think.

Is it more or less short covering that make these type of stocks rally further than other stocks during upswings?

Anyways I'm thinking it's a good trade for a small portion of a portfolio to have some ARKK CARVANA or whatever to make a quick buck and then sell, especially if you're in the red this year as there won't be any gains.

Is there an etf other than ARKK that contains these types of stocks?

I'm thinking maybe IGY or Invescos extended tech etf, but I don't think it contains any weight in stuff like snap, cvna, amc, pton, etc.

I find it interesting that all these ""crap"" companies rallied like 14% the other day!

Must be short covering?

Why would shorts cover? Why do people rush back in to the no earning, risky stuff?

I've heard though that the long dated, no earnings assets are usually the first and fastest to recover.

Why?

For example, CVNA went up 35% this week! Could you imagine if you had a large amount in that?! Whoa!  

MSFT and AAPL didn't go up 35% this week that's for sure!",2022-11-12 16:53:51

1491,should I sell PLTR at almost 70% loss to put it into index funds?,"I made some bad decisions during the meme stock era. I don't do much with stocks, just occasionally look at my meme stock era portfolio. I've been slowly pulling the plug to invest in safer choices. I sold my AMC when it was $25 back in August, so at least there was a net gain of $1500 there.

Idk what I should do with PLTR. I don't see PLTR reaching prices where I will breakeven. Index funds would be probably be a better choice with those $300. I have about 35 shares bought at $26. I'd like to just cut the $600 loss and put the remaining $300 into index funds. I'll take the loss as a lesson learned for me

# [Stock futures fall following the S&P 500′s best week since June](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures traded lower Monday after the S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly gain in almost five months on the back of easing inflation data.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 49 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures declined 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid by 0.5%.
*****
> The S&P 500 rallied 5.9% last week for its best week since June. Investors cheered a lighter-than-expected inflation reading, betting that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its aggressive tightening campaign.
*****
> “A notable shift has occurred in the market, with investors increasingly risk-on across asset classes,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research. “Technical indicators have improved dramatically, with investor sentiment, momentum, breadth, and risk factors all showing notable improvement.”
*****
> The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 8.1% last week for its best week since March, while the blue-chip Dow advanced 4.2%.
*****
> The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge or the VIX, fell 1 point to 22.5, hitting the lowest level since August. The VIX, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500, had traded above the 30 point threshold for most of October.
*****
> Still, the Federal Reserve has given little signal that it could deviate from its tightening path anytime soon. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Sunday that, “We’re at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace.” But, “we’re not softening. ... Quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be. Until we get inflation down, that endpoint is still a ways out there.”
*****
> Investors also digested news on the politics front over the weekend. Democrats will keep control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections, NBC News projected. The party will hold at least 50 seats after Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada held off challenges.
*****
> Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season is set to continue, with a heavy emphasis on retail. Big retailers Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Lowe’s, Macy’s and Kohl’s are all slated to post numbers this week.

HYMC is a gold and silver mining company, their main problem is that they have big debts which they will be able to clear only by 2027, now then why do I write this post? Ahh then the answer is clear, if you would look on gold & silver price in the last week and compare it to HYMC graph you will see a beautiful thing called direct proportion, when gold & silver are growing in price so is HYMC well, you might think of course they mine gold and silver why wont they go up? Well, the answer for that lay between the lines where you think its that easy its not, 

Hycorft are in huge debts and have another indicator AMC, AMC hold a big portion of the company and when their price drop it affect HYMC.

Now when you take to amount both Gold & Silver and AMC you get the reason for why HYMC are on the move up or down, now the nice thing too see that come along as well is that all you want as an investor is that 1 – 3% that the volatility of the stock nature produce. Let’s say today will start on a minus, which mean even going toward 0% makes you as an investor a profit, the fact that gold is going up today and the stock starting down is good.

Well, all I wanted to do here is to give you some sort of a “safe” play to look for its not explosive or anything but might be good for today :D

Of course, if anyone would like I can make another post that will explain everything i know whether HYMC and why I do think for the long term they are a good investment (opinion don’t rush to buy).",2022-11-25 07:34:29

Honing in on the conclusion of the article, here's an excerpt from the tail end of it, of which is appropriately called *The bottom line*:


**The bottom line**

""AMC's stock may never reach the same highs seen during its peak meme stock period, but it's still a viable business as people want to go to movie theaters to watch films. This has been proven over the decades, as moviegoers want the experience of seeing a film on the big screen to get a sense of inclusion that the TV, computers and tablets can't compete with.

The entire stock market has taken hit after hit due to various economic forces and an increase in the federal funds rate. **AMC's loss in share price is in step with what the rest of the stock market is experiencing**. [maybe moreso than the other stocks, due to that APE stock split 😔]

This stock is likely **worth buying for a long-term hold** as the CEO is looking towards the future positively and has cautious plans to improve the chain to deliver more value for moviegoers as well as stockholders.""",2022-11-25 18:30:53

And how, after they created these shares to hide in the crypto exchange markets did it not get noticed until FTX went under?

Basically I don’t understand what the fuck to believe so can someone smarter explain how the two are tied together or are these posts just from hopeful apes wanting to farm upvotes?",2022-11-28 17:34:43

**Comparing the results to its competitors, OLB Group Inc reported Total Revenue increase in the 3 quarter 2022 by 121.2 % year on year.**

**The revenue growth was below OLB Group Inc's competitors average revenue growth of 121.2 %, recorded in the same quarter.**

&#x200B;

**The OLB Group has higher earnings, but lower revenue than MOGU one of its competitors. The OLB Group is trading at a lower price-to-earnings ratio than MOGU, indicating that it is currently the more affordable of the two stocks.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But thats not the end of it as most of the stocks which were trading low in 2020  or before it  boombed and Went Big in 2021

Some of the examples are

 

**GameStop (NYSE: GME)**

GameStop was the big story of 2021. This former penny stock was in the $2s and $3s when we were covering it in 2020…

&#x200B;

That all changed in 2021.

&#x200B;

Retail traders figured out there’s strength in numbers … They applied this strength and squeezed GME into the $400s!

&#x200B;

Volume is always a good thing in penny stocks. With retail traders working together, we’ve seen a lot more of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC)**

&#x200B;

The Reddit crowd gave AMC a jolt in February 2021, but it didn’t quite break out…

&#x200B;

Why? AMC kept issuing new shares, adding to their float.

&#x200B;

This helped the movie theater company stave off bankruptcy. When May rolled around, AMC began its climb to all-time highs.

&#x200B;

AMC kept issuing new shares throughout this rally. The enthusiasm petered out after a June high of $72. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Some big companies started as  penny stock, some as IPO and some fell into penny stocks  but now are fully fledged companies and are ruling the whole share market scenario** 

  some of the examples are 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)**

Don’t be embarrassed…

&#x200B;

We’ve all clicked on the link that tells us what $1,000 invested at Apple’s IPO would be worth now.

&#x200B;

But Apple wasn’t a penny stock in 1980. It just looks that way after adjusting for stock splits and dividends.

&#x200B;

The real time to buy in was at Steve Jobs’ return in the early 2000s. In 2003, AAPL traded as low as $6.56 — almost a legit penny stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)**

Amazon is another all-time regret for many traders.

&#x200B;

At its IPO in 1997, it traded under $2 a share. It graduated from its penny stock designation in 1998. It last dipped below $100 in 2009.

&#x200B;

Even so, the stay-at-home sector’s recent run presented an opportunity. Amazon has run off 100% gains within the past two years!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Medifast Inc. (NYSE: MED)**

As recently as 2008, MED traded as a penny stock.

&#x200B;

Last year? It hit $336 before losing almost half its value…

&#x200B;

It’s a nutrition and weight-loss company. These are always hot sectors, but especially in the stay-at-home age.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F)**

Ford has long been considered a blue-chip stock…

&#x200B;

But the market hasn’t always been kind to legacy automakers like Ford. Just two years ago, the stock dipped into penny stock territory.

&#x200B;

It’s since perked up on electric vehicle news. It hit a 20-year high of $25 in January 2022!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**So having bad days is not the end of the company rather its a kick start for going on to top**

&#x200B;

**And what if some day this less than 1 dollar stock you might see above $100, so now its the best time to buy this stock because once its gonna reach above $100 then it's gonna be difficult to buy**

&#x200B;

So in my opinion i am gonna hold up my shares for the long run as short term does not give results, its the long term which decides the future 

so whats your opinion on **OLB Stocks ?**",2022-12-02 03:29:05

1510,Summary of Carter's Trading Strategy From TastyTrade Rising Star Interview,"Greetings, Traders.

Tom Sosnoff of TastyTrade [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNAZHFdkC14) a young trader named Carter in a live stream from Thu 1 Dec 2022. If you don't want to watch the interview, here's a summary of his strategy.

**Trader**

Carter Dobbelmann, a 20-year-old from San Jose, CA.

**Claim to Fame**

Turned $500 into $30,000 within 1.5 years.

**Affiliations:**

* He's on ""Hourglass Trader."" (Google it.)
* He has replied to comments on the TastyTrade video.

**Strategy**: Selling Volatility

* Exclusively trades options.
* Roughly follows what TastyTrade recommends.¹
* Initially, gambled with six significantly OTM *Long Calls* on TSLA, to go from $500 to $7,000 without knowing anything about the stock market, options, or trading and getting extremely lucky. Then, gambled $7,000 on AMZN calls and blew away $6,000 to drop down to $1,000. After learning a more reasonable way of trading, he looks for high-IV underlyings and:

1. Shorts puts for a credit;
2. Shorts call spreads for a credit; and
3. Shorts put spreads for a credit.

* Because he sells high volatility, he's always looking at IV rank.

**Tactics**

* Trades with the trend of the underlying using vertical spreads.
* Runs *Short Call Spreads* when a stock breaks down, and *Short Puts Spreads* when it rallies.
* If he sees evidence that an active play is reversing, he'll add the opposite spread type from what he initially did. If he shorted a call spread, he'd short a put spread. Or if he shorted a put spread, he'd short a call spread.

**Trade Parameters**

* Sets OTM striking prices, going a little above or below the *expected move*² based on ±1∙ σ and TA.
* Uses DTE = \[7, 30\] days (usually not more than 25 days) on individual companies.
* Uses DTE = \[20, 30\] on SPX.

**Underlyings**

* Is indifferent to the underlying.
* Says he plays indexes, e.g. SPX.
* Initially, he traded CLOV and AMC.
* He recently played SI and GME.

**Trading Activity**

* He places 10 to 15 trades per day.
* He maintains a portfolio of fifteen concurrent positions with many different underlyings.
* With a $30,000 account, he's likely risking $2,000 on each position.

**Profit-Taking**

* He exits whenever he captures 25% to 50% of the maximum theoretical profit, usually closer to the latter.
* Because he uses distributed expirations (e.g. DTE = 7, 14, 20 days), he takes profits virtually every day.

**Risk Management**

* If he ran a *Short Call Spread* and the underlying kept moving up, he'd roll the spread up and widen the striking prices.
* This implies that if he ran a *Short Put Spread* and the underlying keeps moving down, he'd roll the spread down and widen the striking prices.
* He doesn't hold beyond the point of capturing 50% of the maximal theoretical profit to try to minimize risk.
* He manages risk very actively and aggressively.

**Unknown or Unanswered Questions**

* How he builds a watchlist.
* What time(s) of day he typically enters/exits trades.
* Quantity of each trade type.
* Scaling strategy.
* Underlying selection criteria.
* DTE criteria.
* Trigger(s) to roll a trade.
* Trigger(s) to exit a trade.
* Spread width.
* Average number of distinct underlyings in his portfolio.
* Win rate.
* Average profit per trade.

**My Thoughts**

This gives us an outline of what he's doing, but the Devil is in the details, and a lot is missing. Without knowing what IV rank threshold (and other criteria) he's using for scanning for underlyings, the spread width, what decision-making criteria he uses to trigger a roll, etc., we just don't have enough information to be able to try to replicate this.

We also don't know anything about how he's making decisions about where the market is likely to go, overall. Trading during the week of Mon 5 Dec 2022 might be dangerous because more macroeconomic data is being released. On Tue 13 Dec, the CPI will be released. The following day, the Fed will announce its interest rate decision at 2:00 pm ET, followed half an hour later by The JPow's press conference. It would be imprudent to try to trade oblivious to these important macroeconomic catalysts.

This interview is interesting, but ultimately leaves us guessing. Without additional information and a comprehensive list of trades over a three-month period, so that we could look at the transaction times and replay the price action to understand the decision-making, I think that it's impossible to truly figure out what a trader is doing and whether it could have a sustainable edge. What would help the most is an Excel spreadsheet containing every trade's transaction time, action, and a justification for that action. It's impossible to reverse-engineer what we've heard in just the interview well enough to put it to the test.

We can reduce the unknowns by just focusing on SPX. If someone can track Carter down, it would be interesting to get him to fill in the blanks. We really need to understand how he minimizes losses from positions that go against him. To manage risk ""aggressively,"" what triggers him to roll a position, and how soon in the life cycle of a trade that's in trouble does he do this?

Report: Short Sellers May Have Used FTX to Manipulate AMC Stock

Short sellers allegedly used Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX to manipulate the share price of AMC stock. Here's what you need to know.

BERNARD ZAMBONIN DEC 7, 2022 9:15 AM EST

&#x200B;

⦁	An article by The Chainsaw, a Web3 and cryptocurrencies news site, alleges that short sellers possibly used crypto exchange FTX to manipulate the share price of AMC stock via FTX's AMC tokenized shares.

⦁	The report indicates that FTX had about 525,000 AMC crypto tokens, versus the exchange's official claims of having more than 400,000 million.

⦁	Short sellers could have been redeeming AMC tokens for actual shares, which would have allowed them to avoid paying the stock's high borrowing fees.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Was FTX Clearing the Way for Illicit Trading Tactics?

The Chainsaw reported that short-selling hedge funds were using Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX — which recently filed for bankruptcy — as a ""back door"" for shady trading practices.

&#x200B;

This is because FTX had a feature that made it possible to trade synthetic shares and tokenized stocks — digital assets that mirror the price action of stocks.

&#x200B;

According to FTX's terms, customers could redeem all tokenized stocks with FTX Switzerland for underlying shares, if desired. See FTX's tokenized stock generation process, according to Forbes, below:

&#x200B;

 

&#x200B;

Figure 2: FTX tokenized stock generation process.

&#x200B;

According to The Chainsaw, there is evidence that, through a contract with Etherscan, about 525,000 AMC Entertainment  (AMC) - Get Free Report tokens were listed on the FTX crypto exchange. That's inconsistent with official website statements that said there were 400 million AMC tokenized shares available for trading.

&#x200B;

The tipping point for this suspicion came in a comment by Chartered Financial's Peter Hann.

&#x200B;

""When you borrow shares to short, your broker has to claim they can locate. If some stupid crypto exchange says they have 400 million AMC shares, then maybe the broker claims they can easily find,"" he wrote.

Still, according to The Chainsaw, FTX claimed that its 400 million AMC digital tokens were backed by AMC shares held by custodian CM-Equity.

&#x200B;

But the news site noted that FTX had severed ties with the escrow agent late last year, suggesting that during 2022 there were no AMC shares in CM-Equity's custody.

&#x200B;

Raising further suspicion, FTX removed the white paper on AMC tokens from its website in late November.

How Were Short Sellers Allegedly Using FTX to Short AMC?

Short sellers who want to bet against AMC need to borrow shares of the stock to launch their short positions.

&#x200B;

However, it's been hard to borrow AMC shares for some time now, given the high borrowing costs.

&#x200B;

Currently, short sellers need to pay about 30% in annual fees to borrow AMC shares. In mid-November, AMC borrow fees even exceeded 100% annualized. See below:

 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is a suspicion that short sellers have been redeeming AMC tokenized shares, which are supposed to be held by a custody agent, for real AMC shares.

&#x200B;

This would have given short sellers a way to borrow AMC shares without having to pay the high borrowing fees.

&#x200B;

What's Next?

For now, The Chainsaw's report raises many suspicions, but nothing has been concretely proven yet.

&#x200B;

The next step would be to look for hard evidence that any brokerage firm used the FTX's AMC tokenized shares to short the stock. But even then, it's not clear whether any wrongdoing has technically occurred, thanks to regulatory confusion surrounding cryptocurrencies.

&#x200B;

In September, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler spoke about his views on the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Gensler, he visualizes that the functions of exchanges should be separated. For example, an exchange shouldn't act as both a broker and a custodian.

&#x200B;

He also said that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) needs “greater authorities” to regulate crypto non-security tokens and related intermediaries.

“I look forward to working with Congress to achieve that goal consistent with maintaining the regulation of crypto security tokens and related intermediaries at the SEC,"" he said.

1520,Lessons From Trading Risky Volatile Sticks,"Hey everyone, I've spent several years trading volatile risky stocks and I've learned a few lessons along the way. I would like to share them here in case they may be useful to you.

Now before I begin, I want to make it clear that I'm not promoting any particular stock. Nor do I encourage anyone to trade risky volatile stocks. Your best bet is to consistently invest in a total market index fund like VTI and forget about it. If you must invest in individual stocks, invest in safe blue chip stocks like Apple or Amazon.

If you do invest in risky volatile stocks, realize that you can very well lose all your money. This isn't a joke or a game. Take it seriously. I'm sharing what I learned so you can hopefully minimize your risks and maximize your gains.

I don't own any BBBY shares now but I did own many of them earlier this year. In fact, I invested my entire life savings into BBBY shares. I bought at the right time, in late July-early August 2022. I ended up buying around 5000 BBBY shares and my total cost basis was $45,000. This represented my entire life savings as I don't have a 401k or IRA account. So you can imagine that I took on a fair amount of risk by investing my entire life savings in 1 stock. I did it because I wanted to swing trade and make a lot of money.

Now as you may be aware, BBBY share price went up by a lot in August 2022. On August 17th, my 5000 BBBY shares were worth $150,000. Yes, that's right. I had made $105,000 in unrealized gains. Unfortunately, like a greedy fool, I didn't sell. I wanted that $150,000 to reach $500,000 before I sold my BBBY shares. Yes, I was greedy and foolish and paid the price.

This brings me to my first lesson:

**Always take profit when you're in the green.**

You will never be able to time the top so don't even try. Remember, it's better to take some profit then to take none. If your unrealized gains is good enough for you to want to take a screenshot and send to your friends and family, then it's good enough for you to sell and realize those gains. Never forget that. Always sell when you're in the green. Don't be greedy and try to time the top so you can maximize gains.

My second lesson is:

**When you're in the green, at least sell enough shares so that you've covered your cost basis. That way, you're left playing with house money.**

This is a huge one. Cover your cost basis. If I had sold enough BBBY shares to cover my 45k cost basis, I would be in a much better financial situation now. Instead, I was greedy and decided to keep holding so I could make more gains. The best part of doing this is the relief you feel after your cost basis is covered. You know then that you're just playing with house money and even if you lose everything, it's ok because it's house money, not your initial money invested.

Like a naive greedy fool, I held on to my BBBY shares as the share price went down. I could have sold for a huge profit but I decided to keep holding. However, to my credit, I did sell all 5000 of my BBBY shares on Friday, September 2nd 2022 for $8.50 a share. In hindsight, that was a great decision because the BBBY share price kept slowly going down since then and the share price ended under $3 today, Tuesday, December 13th 2022. If I had kept holding those shares and not sold, I would have lost almost 30 thousand dollars.

This takes me to my third lesson:

**Be ready to exit your position, even at a loss, if you feel you will incur more losses by holding on to your position. It's better to take a small loss than a big loss.**

I really didn't want to sell my 5000 BBBY shares. I was hoping that the BBBY shares will go up in price like it did in August. However after analyzing the situation, I realized that the future didn't look bright for BBBY and it would be better I sold and took a $2500 loss rather than holding on to my shares and taking a much bigger loss. Looking back, I sure am glad I sold.

There was another reason why I sold and that's opportunity cost. After analyzing BBBY, I realized that even if the BBBY share price doesn't go down, it will most likely just stagnate and not make me any gains. It would be better to sell my BBBY shares and buy shares of a more promising stock which would make me more gains. That's what I did and it brings me to my fourth lesson:

**In addition to financial gain and losses, always consider opportunity costs and the value of your time. Even if a particular stock doesn't make you lose money, if it doesn't give you gains, then consider the opportunity cost. Consider what you're missing out on by tying your money into this particular stock that isn't taking you anywhere.**

The fifth lesson I learned is that even if your entry point to a particular stock isn't great i.e. you buy in at a high price and the share price subsequently drops, you can improve your cost basis by selling covered calls. This is especially useful for volatile stocks since they tend to have high implied volatility (IV) which usually means higher covered call premiums.

My fifth lesson is therefore:

**Consider selling covered calls to reduce your cost basis and generate some income, especially if you own a lot of shares of a particular stock.**

I'm not going to describe how to sell a covered call here because this post is long enough already but google and youtube will help you there.

Now I've been using BBBY as an example but these lessons are applicable to any risky volatile stock that you decide to trade with. I've traded several different risky stocks such as AMC, Palantir etc. in the past and the lessons I described above are applicable to all of them.

Anyway, that's it guys. I hope this is of some use to you. Please DM me if you have questions and I'll do my best to help. I know that none of the lessons I'm sharing are amazing secrets or anything like that. It's mostly common sense but many rookie traders forget to apply them. I wish someone had taught me these lessons before I started trading stocks which is why I made this post.",2022-12-13 23:48:51

Article: ""Why Do Companies Split Their Stock. Why Investors Love It.""

Excerpt:

""The primary motive of a stock split is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors.""


This is why Gamestop, Apple, Tesla, and others did a stock split. 

But AMC wants to do a 10-for-1 **Reverse** Stock Split:

the resting share price will be estimated around **$62.50** (AMC $5.00 + APE $1.25= 6.25 X 10= $62.50).


There was consistent good Buying Volume in 2021 that helped AMC go from $8.01 to $72.  And good Buying Volume in 2022 when AMC went up to $32 (but got halted).  

But with a new  **higher** share price of $62.50 for AMC, will many retail investors still **Buy** and Hold?    Or just Hold?

# AMC Stock: Why the Creation of APEs Was a Brilliant Move

Despite Wall Street skepticism. The creation of AMC Preferred Equity units (APEs) was a great move by AMC management.

* [BERNARD ZAMBONIN](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/author/bernard-zambonin)
* UPDATED:DEC 22, 2022 8:35 AM ESTORIGINAL:DEC 21, 2022

 

* Since they started being publicly traded, **AMC Preferred Equity** units (APEs) have been in a free fall and are currently worth less than $1 per share.
* However, the creation of the APEs has enabled AMC to raise cash in a period of major macroeconomic challenges.
* APEs have fulfilled their role, according to the movie theater chain's management.

 **Why the APEs Were a Brilliant Creation**

During the second quarter of 2022, **AMC Entertainment**  ([**AMC**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/AMC)) - [Get Free Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&ticker=AMC) [announced](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/amc/ape-stock-what-is-going-on-with-amc-preferred-equity-units) the creation of AMC Preferred Equity units (APEs). Each AMC shareholder received one APE share for each AMC share they owned.

According to the movie theater chain, it was one of the biggest developments of the year.

The main goal for APEs was to enable AMC to raise capital to pay off its approximately $5.4 billion debt load. Furthermore, the money raised would also be useful for M&A (merger and acquisition) funds and would be key to AMC's long-term prospects.

It should be noted that, even though AMC's business is in its best shape since the pandemic, liquidity risks still need to be addressed by the company's management. Currently, AMC’s liquidity is expected to be between $725 million and $825 million by the end of 2022.

The creation of APEs may have sounded bearish to shareholders, who were fearful of further stock dilution. Since APEs began publicly trading, their share price has plummeted 82%, from $6.95 to less than $1 per share today. APE is now a penny stock.

However, on the other hand, AMC's fundamentals have received a boost.

As AMC management reported during the third-quarter (Q3) earnings call, the company wrote off about $144 million of its $400 million in loans and raised roughly $37 million in equity from the sale of some of its preferred shares.

More recently, CEO Adam Aron [announced](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2022/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Raises-162-Million-Through-Sales-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units-APE-Since-Launching-Its-At-The-Market-Program-and-Provides-Business-Update/default.aspx) that more APE units had been sold, accounting in the last 90 days for about 3% of the total available. With this small percentage alone, AMC was able to raise a total of about $160 million in cash.

AMC also invested in its core business by buying a popular Arclight movie theater and restructured its debts by discounting them by more than 60%.

If the selling of APE units continues, even though its share price may suffer in the short term, the move should pay off in the long term.

## Standing Out Among Its Peers

Since before the pandemic, the movie theater industry has been facing uncertain times.

The pandemic was catastrophic for the movie theater industry, and even after a partial recovery, rivals such as Cineworld have declared bankruptcy.

According to IBISWorld, the annualized market size growth of movie theaters in the U.S. fell by 14% from 2017 to 2022, even though it had recovered 31% from the pandemic by 2022.

The bearish macro scenario, marked by inflation and high-interest rates, has put extra pressure on leveraged companies like many in the movie theater sector. Because of this, CEO Adam Aron made a point of highlighting the APE initiative as crucial to serving as a protection for AMC in the face of liquidity challenges.

>""At a time when one or more of our competitors have been facing potentially devastating liquidity challenges, by contrast during the past 90 days, AMC has been able to raise $162 million of additional cash through the sale of equity thereby improving our liquidity position markedly,"" said AMC's CEO.

## What About APE Units' Share Price?

APE units' share price has certainly disappointed investors and is currently trading at penny-stock levels. There is now a difference of nearly $4 between AMC's and APE's share prices.

Considering that both assets have the same value in theory, this can be partly attributed to arbitrage trades, which consist of simultaneously buying and selling the same asset in different markets to profit from small differences in the list price of these assets.

On the other hand, we can also note that the volume of APE units traded in recent sessions is more than 70% off-exchange, i.e., in over-the-counter markets. This makes AMC shareholders suspicious of the fact that APE units are being traded in ""dark pools."" This is legal, but there is very little transparency in these trades.

However, according to some academic [studies](https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SIFMA-Insights-Analyzing-Off-Exchange-Trading-09-2021.pdf), the increase in off-exchange volume is an indicator of volume growth, particularly for retail trading in assets such as penny stocks — not necessarily a sign that flows are changing.

The fact is that, even if there may be some manipulation in the way APE units are being traded, they are fulfilling their role as proposed by AMC management.

This is attested by AMC's CEO, Adam Aron:

1548,5 Lessons Learned From Super Investors In 2022," Today, I wanted to write out some of the lessons that I have personally learned this year by reading and watching some of the great, super investors. We are going to be taking a look at Seth Klarman, Jeremy Grantham, Peter Lynch, Guy Spier, and of course Warren Buffett. It is important to continually learn when we are looking at the market and viewing the knowledge from these investors allows us to not make the same mistakes as they learned the hard way. Please let me know if you learned any lessons and what they are!

If you want to view my Youtube explanation you can click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-YIryPj1-Q).

**1.) Seth Klarman’s HBS Interview (My summary** [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BzVd9GLGv8)**)** 

> Two things happen in markets; right markets are inefficient partly because of human nature, as I mentioned; greed and fear. People get greedy and panic; in some cases, the panic is legitimate. ""Oh crap, I leveraged my portfolio, and I'm getting a margin call."" or ""I have short-term clients, and they can redeem, and I'm getting redeemed, and I have to sell whether I like it or not."" There are other constraints on investors that also create inefficiencies. Once in a while, we get a call from someone with one asset in their private equity fund who want to raise the next fund. They want to book a gain on that asset. And so, call it the last asset phenomenon. People literally will sell that more urgently, and maybe they'll favor getting it done over the exact price they get because they want to raise their next fund and move on. They want to book a game and get paid. We live in an imperfect world, and their clients should probably not love that, but maybe their clients would love it. The manager has a lot of things to balance, so that's just one little example. When a bond gets downgraded, there's always an immediate rush to the exits by the investment-grade holders. A bond gets downgraded to junk, say when the bond goes literally from BBB to BB. Many bonds have to get sold; some are probably sold in advance. It's good to know what a company does, its operations, and its worth. It's also interesting to know that there's a very large seller, and the bonds are 20 points lower. With essentially no change in any information, just the rating of a 26 year old at moody's. So those are the kinds of things that can trigger our interest then we do fundamental work 

I picked out this large section from his talk at HBS as one of my points when I summarized the interview. He highlights the fact that there are some assets in the market that may be mispriced. They could be mispriced for a multitude of reasons, but one of the causes could be current holders’ own needs or requirements. There will be times when a large fund wants to dump shares simply because they don’t want their current investors to think they hold companies at a loss. Other times, management at the fund may just want to start up a whole new fund focused on a different industry which causes them to dump shares at a price that is likely not a “reasonable” price relative to the asset that they are selling off. As value investors, it is our job to try to find these mispricings and allocate capital when the risk-to-reward matches our own criteria for our portfolios. The human psychology of the market definitely plays a role in various mispricings in the market. 

**2.)**  **Jeremy Grantham’s - “Let the Wild Rumpus Begin”** **(link** [**here**](https://www.gmo.com/globalassets/articles/viewpoints/2022/gmo_let-the-wild-rumpus-begin_1-22.pdf)**)** 

> The final feature of the great superbubbles has been a sustained narrowing of the market and unique underperformance of speculative stocks, many of which fall as the blue chip market rises. This occurred in 1929, in 2000, and it is occurring now. A plausible reason for this effect would be that experienced professionals who know that the market is dangerously overpriced yet feel for commercial reasons they must keep dancing prefer at least to dance off the cliff with safer stocks. This is why at the end of the great bubbles it seems as if the confidence termites attack the most speculative and vulnerable first and work their way up, sometimes quite slowly, to the blue chips. 

From this letter and the quote above, I have learned that it is important to understand what environment you are operating within and what other investors are doing when looking to acquire businesses in your own portfolio. Ideally, we as value investors, want to buy companies that are able to sustain downswings even though the current environment feels like a party that will never end. There were many IPOs that occurred over the last few years and we have seen many go bust or deteriorate majorly just within 2022. This was also compounded by the fact that many fund managers knew that the current market was running hot, but did not want to potentially look dumb in front of their own clients if they did not invest in the next $AMC or $GME. The musical chairs that they were playing with their own investor’s money is a dangerous game, but it goes to show you how important incentives are plus what opportunities may arise from human actions. 

**3.)  Peter Lynch -** ***One Up On Wall Street*** 

> What I try to remind myself (and obviously I’m not always successful) is that if the prospects are so phenomenal, then this will be a fine investment next year and the year after that. Why not put off buying the stock until later, when the company has established a record? Wait for the earnings. You can get tenbaggers in companies that have already proven themselves. When in doubt, tune in later.  
Often with the exciting longshots the pressure builds to buy at the initial public offering (IPO) or else you’re too late. This is rarely true, although there are some cases where the early buying surge brings fantastic profits in a single day. On October 4, 1980, Genentech came public at $35 and on the same afternoon traded as high as $89 before backing off to $71¼. Magellan was allocated a small number of shares (you can’t always get shares in hot public offerings). I did better with Apple Computer, which I sold on the first day for a 20 percent gain, because I was able to buy as many shares as I wanted. That was because a day before the offering, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ruled that only sophisticated buyers could purchase Apple because the company was too speculative for the general public. I didn’t buy Apple again until after it collapsed and became a turnaround. 

I had listened to interviews and speeches from Peter Lynch, but this was the first time I was reading his famous work. The quote above resonates with me because as I mentioned earlier there were quite a few IPOs that came out for very hyped-up companies. This idea that “you have to beat the crowd” is misplaced because you are buying a business not a place in line to get into a Black Friday store first. If a company is actually a compounding machine, there will be points in time when the market value will fall into the"" “below fair value” range. An example of this can be seen when you look at Berkshire Hathaway’s purchase of Apple’s stock in 2016. While they may have not gotten the initial run-up in price from Apple’s IPO, they still invested and did very well on their investment. This compounding machine is still working away today. Again, part of value investing is weighing the risk to match the potential reward that will occur at some point in the future. 

**4.)  Guy Spier -** ***Education of a Value Investor*** 

> Sometimes they’re no doubt right. Logically, perhaps, I should switch phone services or load up on their brilliant investment idea. But I just won’t do it. I may miss out in the short term. But over a lifetime I have no doubt that I’ll benefit much more by detaching myself from people with a self-interest in getting me to buy stuff. This is a simple application of “adverse selection.” As Charlie Munger has joked, “All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I’ll never go there.” For me if an investment is being sold, that’s a place where I certainly want to avoid going.   
>  
> I even apply this rule if I am at a cocktail party and someone starts telling me about a great stock they own or a private comapny in which they’d me to invest. I may listen. I may be impressed. I may even be tempted. But I won’t buy if they gain something from my doing so. In some cases, this might not be a sales commission or any other financial benefit: it might simply be that they derive psychological validation from successfully selling their idea. Either way, this is a no-go zone for me because the provenance of the idea is wrong since it stems from the seller’s personal agenda.  
>  
> As usual, Buffett knew this long before I did. For example, he has a rule never to participate in an open outcry auction. Following his lead, I’ve never invested in an IPO and probably never will. When a company is going public, it has all of the mind-warping sales power of Wall Street behind it. Of course, some IPOs catch the wind perfectly and soar. But the provenance is toxic, so it’s safer for me to cross all IPOs off my buy list, even if this means missing out on an occasional winner.   
>  
> *The Rule:* If the seller has a self-interest in me buying, I ain’t buying. 

I believe that I read this book after reading Peter Lynch’s book mentioned in point 3. For me, it solidified the idea of how an investor needs to think for themselves and try to view the company unbiasedly. The marketing of Wall Street for this “hot new stock” will certainly lead to ruin more often than not because the underwriters get their commission once the stock is listed. They don’t care whether or not it does well 5 or 10 years down the line. Also, this goes along with the idea that you want to fish where the fish are and you aren’t competing for river bank space versus the IPOs where everyone is seething to get in low and sell high. Coinbase is a great example of an IPO that started flying out the gate and has fallen back down to Earth since. It IPO’d in April 2021 and shot up as high as $430. Today, the price of the company sits at $32.53. Whatever your opinion is on the company, it goes to show you that Wall Street is not selling you a reasonably priced item when it comes to IPOs because that is not where their incentives lie. 

5.)  **Warren Buffett (BRK) Buying Stocks** 

Lastly, I do not have a quote or anything too specific from BRK to reference, but for me taking a look at the buying behavior of those who are at Berkshire Hathaway and of course, more specifically, Warren Buffett. BRK did not go too heavy into any assets over 2020 - 2021, but when it came time to finally make some large plunges Warren did not hesitate. He saw what other money managers were doing during the hype cycle, but he continued to look for value by turning over different stones. When Oxy fell to a favorable range, BRK did not hesitate to load up very heavily on ownership in the oil sector through Oxy and some others. This lesson also shows that if you have done the research on a company, and are very patient, these undervalued opportunities will allow you to strike quickly. As the saying goes, “strike while the iron is hot.”

I hope you enjoyed some of the lessons that I learned this year. While I have read and listened more this year, these 5 lessons were not the only thing I learned. However, they were some of the most important lessons that I learned this year. I looked forward to continually learning in 2023 and adding to my tool belt. Did you have any lessons that you learned this year either through reading or through your own findings? Please let me know down below!",2022-12-28 18:21:03
