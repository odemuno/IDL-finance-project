2020-12-03,Theater Chains Vexed by Warner Bros.’ Straight-to-Streaming Move,0.0,Neutral
2020-12-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warner Bros. and HBO Max, two units of AT&T Inc., just delivered a crushing blow to movie theaters. All of the studio’s films set for release next year — including “The Suicide Squad,” “Dune” and “The Matrix 4” — will go straight to the HBO Max streaming service at the same time that they play in cinemas. While Warner executive Ann Sarnoff sees it as a “unique one-year plan,” let’s be honest, it’s not. Even as Covid-19 vaccines near approval, it could be a while before consumers feel safe returning to the close confines of a shut-in movie theater. In the latest Morning Consult poll of 2,200 U.S. adults conducted in the final days of November, 51% said it would be four to six months or even longer before they’d feel comfortable resuming trips to the movies; another 26% said they didn’t know or didn’t have an opinion on it. By the time most people do feel safe going, many still may not want to. What I wrote in October — as exhibitor AMC Entertainment Inc. warned of possible bankruptcy — bears repeating:We have learned to live without movie theaters. Even the ones that make it through the crisis may find that online-streaming apps have stolen away audiences for good.Unlike amusement-park rides and cruises, which have been equally paralyzed by the pandemic, the movie experience can be replicated at home — and sometimes more cheaply and conveniently. It will be that much harder for theater chains to bounce back. The place cinemas have in our culture and history, and the thousands of jobs they provide, makes it all the more tragic. But consumers keep signaling that going to the movies is more of an occasional treat when there’s a must-see blockbuster film than a regular habit. That’s not enough to support 40,449 movie screens in the U.S., the latest total published by the National Association of Theater Owners. As I noted in October, higher ticket prices have helped give the false sense that box-office sales are climbing, when in fact adjusting for inflation shows that they’ve gradually fallen over the last 20 years:Companies such as AT&T and Walt Disney Co. are responding as they must by going where audiences are. And that’s at home. The box office is a crucial source of profit for the Hollywood giants, but prioritizing that over streaming will only hurt them in the long run as Netflix Inc. rounds the corner on 200 million subscribers. The first domino fell in July, when Comcast Corp.’s Universal Studios struck an agreement with AMC to cut short the time its films play exclusively at theaters. Then Disney, the single most important company to movie-theater businesses, bypassed them and put “Mulan” directly on Disney+ in September for a viewing fee of $30. Last week, I wrote that Disney+ would be smart to offer a “box-office pass” subscription tier for movie fans willing to pay up for continuing virtual access to new theatrical releases. HBO Max, which costs $15 a month, won't charge anything extra for its films, for now at least.Shares of AT&T popped slightly on its announcement Thursday, while AMC and Cinemark Holdings Inc. plunged 16% and 22%, respectively. Just beforehand, as my colleague Brian Chappatta noted, AMC’s most-traded bonds had rallied to 35 cents, up from only 5 cents in early November. As for Disney and its peers, streaming has been a money-losing venture so far. But the fastest way to start turning a profit is to sign up lots of people. And Netflix has shown that the way to do that is to flood them with content — all the better if it’s movie-theater-quality films. Now that Warner Bros. is planning to do just that in 2021, it’s hard to imagine them turning back.

The biggest chain, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., has said it may run out of cash by the end of this year or early in 2021.“We plan to use this filing to strengthen our business by reducing liabilities and reposition SMG to emerge a stronger organization built for the future as we recover from the unparalleled impact of Covid-19,” Chairman Brian Schultz said in a letter on the company’s website.The outbreak forced SMG to temporarily close all its locations earlier this year. About a third of the company’s 33 theaters are still closed, according to its website; the rest are open for business as usual, it said.Secured lenders to the Dallas-based company agreed to provide a new loan to support its restructuring, according to the letter. Studio Movie Grill has assets between $50 million and $100 million and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million, according to its Chapter 11 petition.The case is Studio Movie Grill Holdings LLC, 20-32633-sgj11, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas).For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",0.9617,Positive

2020-10-20,"Shares in AMC Entertainment are sinking 13% after the cash-strapped theater chain announced plans to sell another 15 million shares in a public offering but warned that the move might not be enough to shore up the liquidity needed to avert a debt restructuring.According to an SEC filing AMC (AMC) is seeking to sell up to 15 million shares of its Class A common stock par value $0.01 per share. The theater operator said it expects total revenues for the three months ended September 30 to be approximately $119.5 million down from the $1.32 billion recorded during the same period last year. Furthermore, AMC estimated that its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30 was $417.9 million.“The Company intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment, refinancing, redemption or repurchase of existing indebtedness or working capital, capital expenditures and other investments,” AMC stated in the SEC filing. “In the event the Company determines that these sources of liquidity will not be available to it or will not allow it to meet its obligations as they become due, it would likely seek an in-court or out-of-court restructuring of its liabilities, and in the event of a future liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the Company’s Common Stock would likely suffer a total loss of their investment.”Earlier this year, AMC was forced to close its movie theaters worldwide and temporarily suspend operations as a result of the global lockdowns triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. As of last week, the company has resumed operations at 519 of its 598 US theaters, with limited seating capacities of between 20% and 40%. AMC disclosed that since the resumption of operations in its US markets, it recorded about 2.6 million guests as of October 16, representing a same-theatre attendance decline of about 85% compared to the same period a year ago.Shares in AMC have been hit hard and have plunged 58% so far this year, with analysts sidelined on the stock. The Hold consensus splits into 4 Holds vs 1 Sell. Meanwhile, the $5.17 average analyst price target implies a promising 67% upside potential in the shares over the coming year.B. Riley analyst Eric Wold last week maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $4.50 price target.“Given the unlikely ability to complete any additional debt financings, we would expect continued dilution under additional equity offerings and/or minority investments in the company's equity,” Wold wrote in a note to investors. “While we acknowledge that a Neutral stance for AMC shares may be too optimistic given our continued liquidity concerns, we also believe that should the major US markets yet to reopen given the green light in the near-term, both the reaction to the company's share price and ability to secure capital could be extremely positive.” (See AMC stock analysis on TipRanks)Related News: AMC Dips 6% Amid Cash Crunch Warning Visa Nabs Strategic Stake In UK Fintech Company GPS Atlassian Pops 9% On Accelerated Cloud Shift; Analyst Says Buy More recent articles from Smarter Analyst: * Crown Holdings Posts 3Q Profit Win, Initiates Dividend Pay * Activist Investor Starboard Ramps Up ACI Stake To 9%; Shares Rise * UBS Rises As Quarterly Profit Pops 99%; Street Sees 22% Upside * Simmons’ 3Q EPS Beats Estimates; Analyst Sticks To Buy",0.9599,Positive

2020-10-19,"Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings are soaring 14% after the largest US theatre chain announced plans to reopen about a dozen of its movie theatre locations in New York state, primarily in portions of Upstate New York and on Long Island, starting from Oct. 23. The move came after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday that “movie theaters outside of New York City can reopen at 25% capacity under state guidance starting October 23.”AMC (AMC) said that “Beginning Friday, AMC will be serving guests in 44 of the 45 states where it has theatres, and all these AMC locations will abide by all state and local ordinances.” The company also expects to reopen more than 530 theatres in the US by the end of October.Last week, AMC had warned of a potential cash shortage, if the movie theatres continued to remain closed. The company stated in a SEC filing that “Given the reduced movie slate for the fourth quarter, in the absence of significant increases in attendance from current levels or incremental sources of liquidity, at the existing cash burn rate, the Company anticipates that existing cash resources would be largely depleted by the end of 2020 or early 2021.” (See AMC stock analysis on TipRanks)On Oct. 13, B. Riley Financial analyst Eric Wold said that “should the major US markets yet to reopen given the green light in the near-term, both the reaction to the company’s share price and ability to secure capital could be extremely positive.” The analyst maintained a Hold rating and a price target of $4.50 (48% upside potential) on the stock.Currently, the Street is also sidelined on the stock. The Hold analyst consensus is based on 4 Holds and 1 Sell. Given the year-to-date share price decline of 54.7%, the average price target of $5.17 implies upside potential of about 70.1% to current levels.Related News: AMC Dips 6% Amid Cash Crunch Warning Visa Nabs Strategic Stake In UK Fintech Company GPS Atlassian Pops 9% On Accelerated Cloud Shift; Analyst Says Buy More recent articles from Smarter Analyst: * Lennox Boosts 2020 Outlook; Street Says Hold * Smart Global To Buy Cree’s LED Business For $300M * ConocoPhillips Snaps Up Rival Concho in $9.7B Deal; Shares Advance * AstraZeneca Gets EU Recommendations For Heart Failure, Lung Treatments",0.9552,Positive

2020-10-13,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is considering a range of options that include a potential bankruptcy to ease its debt load as the pandemic keeps moviegoers from attending and studios from supplying films.Lenders to the world’s biggest cinema chain have held preliminary talks among themselves about providing the movie-theater company with financing if it decides to file for Chapter 11 court protection, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The fresh cash would keep AMC in business while it crafts a recovery plan, the people said.No formal proposals have been exchanged with AMC, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. The situation remains fluid and plans could change, depending on negotiations and market conditions, the people said. This includes the impact of the coronavirus, with ticket sales suffering because state and local officials are urging moviegoers to stay home.Other OptionsA representative for Leawood, Kansas-based AMC declined to comment. AMC said in a filing Tuesday that cash could run out by the end of this year or early next year if attendance doesn’t pick up, and it’s exploring actions to boost liquidity that include asset sales, renegotiating leases, joint ventures and debt or equity financing. There’s significant risk that its efforts will fall short or fail, AMC warned.Lenders are getting advice from lawyers at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and bankers at Greenhill & Co., Bloomberg previously reported.Cinema chains are facing a chicken-and-egg problem with no near-term solution: As local capacity restrictions and audience skittishness keep U.S. theaters largely empty, studios are delaying most of their major film releases into 2021 and beyond, which gives consumers still less reason to buy tickets.AMC’s attendance since the resumption of business in the U.S. is down about 85% from the same period a year ago, the company said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",0.3037,Positive
