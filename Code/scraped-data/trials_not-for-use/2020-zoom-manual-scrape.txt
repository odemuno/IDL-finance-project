Zoom: Shares Could Be Volatile but Rosy Outlook Remains Intact, Says Analyst
There’s just no pleasing the market sometimes. On Monday, Zoom (ZM) dialed in another strong quarterly statement, only to see its share price drop by 15% in the following session.It has been a breakout year for the video conferencing platform, but investors were evidently nonplussed by the size of the latest beat and raise, as it didn’t quite match the prior two quarters’ estimate-crushing results.While Needham analyst Richard Valera points out other possible reasons for the sell off, none are of much concern to him when considering Zoom’s long-term prospects.“Acknowledging ZM shares will likely continue to be subject to volatility on potential rotation away from WFH names and/or concerns regarding tough comps looming in F2Q22 and beyond, we think an enduring shift towards remote work and ZM's rapidly growing installed base into which it can cross-sell Phone, Rooms and future products, afford it the opportunity to double revenue again in the next 3-4 years,” the 5-star analyst commented.In F3Q21, Zoom’s revenue clocked in at $777.19 million, amounting to a 366.5% year-over-year increase and coming in ahead of consensus estimates by $83.06 million. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.99 was way above the Street’s $0.76 call.New customer adds once again tilted toward the “historically higher-churn” sub 10 member group, which accounted for 38% of additions in 3Q, up from 36% in the second quarter and 30% in 1Q. On the other hand, customers contributing over $100,000 of TTM (trailing twelve months) revenue provided a 136% year-over-year uptick, amounting to the “fastest growth in this cohort in the last 8 quarters, showing impressive traction with these larger customers.”Looking ahead, Zoom’s F4Q21 guidance is for revenue of between $806 to 811 million and EPS between $0.77-0.79, beating the consensus calls for $728 million and $0.62, respectively.Overall, there’s no change to Valera’s rating which stays a Buy, while the $540 price target stays put, too. The implication for investors? Upside of 31%. (To watch Valera’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, Zoom’s ratings are mostly split between the believers and the fence sitters. Barring 1 Sell, ZM's Moderate Buy consensus rating rests on 12 Buys and 11 Holds. The average price target stands at $485.16, suggesting upside of 18% over the next 12 months.

Slack’s CEO Is Back in The Passenger Seat After Salesforce Deal
(Bloomberg) -- With a sale to Salesforce, Slack’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Stewart Butterfield is back in a familiar position: running the startup he created while inside a corporate behemoth.In 2005, Butterfield sold his photo-sharing site Flickr to Yahoo! Inc., but resigned a few years later, after chafing at the web company’s corporate culture and bureaucracy. He created another hit product — workplace chat software — and after a decade of building, took Slack Technologies Inc. public last year. But instead of continuing on his own path, he and Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff shook hands. “This is the most strategic combination in the history of software,” Butterfield wrote in the news release about the acquisition. “I can’t wait to get going.”This time, there’s plenty for 47-year-old Butterfield and his executives to feel triumphant about. The $27.7 billion deal announced Tuesday is Salesforce’s biggest acquisition, almost twice its splurge on Tableau Software Inc. last year. Butterfield’s net worth jumped by $400 million even before the deal happened, as Slack’s stock price shot up after news reports of the plan.Still, for those who remember how Butterfield felt about his last time working under someone else, the decision might seem surprising. The Flickr sale was 15 years ago, but his displeasure at Yahoo is a small part of Silicon Valley lore. He wrote a sly and playful resignation memo, which captured his philosophical tendencies. In the letter, he cast himself as a simple tin smither toiling away at an industrial conglomerate, but saw that things had shifted to a point where he felt “adrift” and wanted to step aside.Those who knew him also caught glimpses of his unhappiness at Yahoo. He felt it was “a difficult place and a difficult corporate environment,” said Jason Shellen, who worked as Slack’s head of platform product in 2016 and knew Butterfield previously. Years ago, Shellen, who previously worked at Google, tried to have the search giant buy Flickr instead of Yahoo. One time, Shellen said, Butterfield called him while driving to Yahoo’s campus in Sunnyvale, California, and said he wished he were in Mountain View at Google instead.Either way, Shellen said, “I don’t think he’s cut out to be at anyone else’s place for super long.” The only exception, he thought, was if the new company really matched Butterfield’s ethos, and he saw Benioff, who’s known for his insistence on heartfelt corporate values, as potentially compatible. For years, Slack seemed like Butterfield’s chance to run his own show. In some ways, it felt like fate. He and his team had created Flickr almost inadvertently. They’d wanted to build a video game, and when that didn’t pan out, the game’s photo-storing technology ended up being both useful and popular. Then it happened all over again: Butterfield and his team built an online game called Glitch, but it didn't take off. What did? Slack, the tool the team built to message each other and collaborate online.Slack’s workplace chat software was an instant hit before it even launched to the public. It changed how co-workers talked with each other. In countless offices, it wiped out internal emails and replaced them with topic-specific channels. It didn’t have mere users, it had superfans who convinced their employers to pay for the software. In 2014, Butterfield told Wired that his ambition was “to be the next Microsoft.”Then Microsoft Corp. took notice. In 2016, the software giant announced it was developing Teams, its own version of workplace chat. Slack bought a full-page ad in the New York Times to send Microsoft a letter reminding people the San Francisco-based startup was first. “Dear Microsoft,” it read. “Wow. Big news! … We’re genuinely excited to have some competition.”Inside Slack, this was a moment when things got serious, Shellen said. Microsoft couldn’t be ignored. “They really just copied Slack, and they were using every trick in the book to boost their user numbers,” Shellen said. Microsoft made Teams free for its enormous constituency of Office365 customers. “It becomes harder to convince people that they should pay for a better version of the same thing they already have,” Shellen said. When the pandemic came and bulldozed through 2020, Slack suddenly became vital to companies frantically trying to adjust to a fully remote workplace. It hit record user numbers, and its sales grew 39% in the quarter that ended in October, but investors were underwhelmed. Its stock price didn’t soar to the same quarantine-driven heights as Zoom Video Communications Inc.’s, as video became the de facto way for people to hold meetings, celebrate birthdays and catch up with friends. In a Bloomberg Businessweek interview in April, Butterfield spoke candidly about running a public company under intense pressure during Covid. “I find everything more challenging right now, like making time to cook and eat and shower,” he said. “I feel much more exhausted at the end of the day.”Then, at some point, Butterfield started to have conversations with Bret Taylor, Salesforce’s chief operating officer, someone who also built a corporate product, Quip, and sold it to Salesforce. Butterfield and Taylor began pondering a way the companies could join forces, Benioff said Tuesday in a conference call with analysts. They then pitched the Salesforce boss on the idea, and he was amazed, calling it “a wow.”Butterfield wasn’t pushed by his board or shareholders to pursue the sale, which was his decision, a person close to the executive said. Taylor, a veteran of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc., was a key reason why Butterfield found the deal appealing, the person said. People familiar with Butterfield’s thinking said another reason he would be interested in the transaction would be to gain thousands more salespeople to distribute Slack’s software.Butterfield has sold $135 million worth of shares since the direct listing — daily at first, and then every few weeks more recently, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. His net worth, including proceeds from share sales, stands at about $1.8 billion.Observers are divided on what the sale signifies for Slack’s hunger to take over the enterprise world. One person familiar with Butterfield’s thinking said that the takeover represents a concession to Slack’s fierce competition with Microsoft.Others disagreed. Butterfield “is much more competitive than people would give him credit for,” said Andrew Braccia, an investor with Accel and a Slack board member. “A lot of people look at Stewart and they imagine him being this thoughtful, smart, compassionate, empathetic leader. Any decision that Stewart is making, at any point in his life, he's taking from the perspective of being competitive and wanting to win. He wants to put Slack in absolutely the best possible position.”Butterfield plans to stay at Salesforce and run Slack as its own division, the companies said this week. Given Butterfield’s past accidental hits, it’s tempting for people to imagine him rolling the dice again. But that’s not likely.“When are you going to start your third online gaming company?” one user tweeted at him last month. Butterfield’s reply made it clear: “Never! I’m done now :)”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

Zoom Slides as Earnings Raise Post-Pandemic Growth Questions
(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. fell the most in more than three weeks on Tuesday after third-quarter results brought the high-flying stock rally to an abrupt halt. Analysts questioned whether the video-conferencing company’s momentum can be sustained once the pandemic begins to subside and more people return to working in offices and traveling to visit friends and families.“Given the elevated expectations heading into the print, and the fear around what a post-Covid growth rate may look like for the company, we would expect near-term share weakness to persist,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Alex Zukin wrote in a note Tuesday.Zoom on Monday gave a revenue forecast for the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates but suggested a drop in its explosive growth, highlighting investors’ concerns that 2021 won’t be as favorable for the software maker as this year.Zoom’s valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio above 270, is “stretched” in light of the uncertainty for fiscal 2022 growth, Piper Sandler said.Shares closed down 15% on Tuesday, the biggest drop since Nov. 9. Even with that drop, the stock is up nearly 500% this year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

Tech Sector: Silver Linings For Cloud, Chips, And Subscriptions In Earnings?
As the broader market attempts to gun the gas after its September slump, Tech once again leads the charge. Now earnings loom for the high-flying sector, giving investors a fresh chance to catch up on the latest developments at "mega-caps" like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), as well as the so-called "stay at home" companies powering the economy.While Tech leads the S&P 500 Index (SPX) in sector performance year to date, Tech's fundamentals vary on an industry level, none falling under a neat categorical umbrella. We have to look at the particulars, and how the "worst of times" may have brought out the "best" in companies equipped to help consumers deal with the pandemic and the way it's changed peoples' lives.So, let's take a look at the top Tech companies as we head into Q3 earnings and the last quarter of 2020. We're talking about AAPL, MSFT, Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)--companies whose streaming, remote, and (in the case of AMD) powering capabilities continue to allow households and businesses to function as near to normal as possible. Ideas that we might be stuck at home longer could help explain recent rallies in stocks like ZM, DocuSign Inc (NASDAQ: DOCU), and Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON), though some of these aren't "pure" Tech companies. When the virus started, many of us talked about how we'd be in the office by September. Then it was maybe October, and now people are talking about the end of the calendar year.If shutdowns get pushed to next spring or summer, it means more of a commitment dollar-wise. The third or fourth wave of adopters will come in, meaning companies and individuals who'd put off doing things the new way will probably decide they can't wait any longer. If shutdowns last, it's bad for most people, but good for some Tech companies. They might see benefit from holdouts who thought they wouldn't have to spend on Tech solutions that allow people to work from home. These holdouts can sometimes be the harder sale, but can be most sticky over time. They tend to hate change, but when they finally do make transitions they stay, and it can become an amazing opportunity for companies that offer solutions.One thing seems certain: The market is rewarding Tech companies that form the heart of the "stay at home" economy." Looking at these companies from a wide-view lens, year to date, ZM is up an eye-popping 615%, while AMD shares are up 71%. AAPL is up 65% and MSFT is up 37%. That compares with about an 8% rise for the SPX.These performances come amid a backdrop where analysts estimate a Q3 earnings decline of -20.5% across the broader market (S&P 500), according to researcher FactSet. This gels with research firm CFRA's recent earnings outlook, which sees 90% of the S&P 500's sub-industries posting declines.While Tech isn't immune to these struggles, FactSet sees Q3 Information Technology earnings falling just 2.6%, the third best performer among sectors. If analysts are right, Tech would trail only Health Care and Utilities. FIGURE 1: SINGING THE SEPTEMBER BLUES. After a rough September in which the Technology sector (IXT--candlestick) fell sharply and Nasdaq went into correction territory amid fears of an overbought market, Tech is back to outpacing the S&P 500 Index (SPX--purple line) so far in October. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Software Goes Pedal to the Metal Among the six Tech sector industries, software occupies the lead position in year-to-date performance, according to Morningstar data.Let's start with MSFT, the industry's market cap leader. MSFT came out its FY Q4 relatively unscathed. Not quite an earnings blowout, but an indisputable earnings beat, based on Refinitiv consensus. Cloud is often top of mind when MSFT reports, so investors will keep an eye on how it's doing in the sizzling competition between MSFT, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), IBM (NYSE: IBM), and other companies in the space. Growth of Microsoft's Azure cloud in FYQ4 slowed to 47% from 59% in the previous quarter.Also, consider keeping an eye on spending. MSFT's capital expenditures swelled in FYQ4 as the company expands its cloud infrastructure. This can potentially eat into profit.Looking toward MSFT's FYQ1 earnings, expected Oct. 21, CFO Amy Hood forecasts MSFT's Intelligent Cloud revenues to come in between $12.55 billion and $12.8 billion, with Productivity and Business processes revenue between $11.65 billion and $11.9 billion. Hood sees the More Personal Computing segment delivering around $10.95 billion and $11.35 billion.MSFT may be among the industry leaders by market cap, but in terms of market performance, it got dwarfed by relative newcomer ZM, whose video conferencing technologies struck the proverbial gold mine when it happened to offer one of the most adaptive resources for the "lockdown lifestyle."In its most recent quarterly results, ZM dished out yet another earnings blowout, doubling Refinitiv EPS expectations and delivering year-over-year revenue growth of 355%.Unlike other Tech behemoths, whose portfolios of products can often be diverse, ZM has a single but scalable product focus--its video conferencing platform. More than 80% of its revenue is driven by consumer subscriptions. And based on its market performance it appears many investors may not see momentum slowing any time soon. There's a saying that fortune favors the bold. Whether fortune continues to find ZM or not, it made an arguably bold move in its last earnings press release, revising its Q3 and full 2021 fiscal year guidance significantly higher (from the previous quarter), betting on continuing demand for remote work solutions. As its rival MSFT recently announced it will be allowing its workers to ditch the office for the comforts of a remote workspace (presumably using the MSFT Teams app), ZM's forecast of future workspaces remaining remote might be right on the mark.Upcoming Earnings Data Company (Ticker) Release Date (U = unconfirmed) 3rd Party Consensus Per-Share Earnings Estimate 3rd Party Consensus Revenue Est. and +/- vs. Year Ago IBM (IBM) Oct-19 $2.58 $17.54 bln (-2.7%) Microsoft (MSFT) Oct-27 $1.54 $35.69 bln (+8%) Intel (INTC) Oct-22 $1.10 $18.22 bln (-5%) Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Oct-27 (U) $0.35 $2.56 bln (+42.2%) Apple (AAPL) Oct-29 $0.70 $63.83 bln (-0.3%) Salesforce (CRM) Dec-1 (U) $0.75 $5.25 bln (+16.3%) Slack (WORK) Dec-2 (U) -$0.04 $224.6 mln (N/A) Zoom (ZM)Dec-4 (U) $0.76$691.93 mln (+315.3%) Data as of 10/15/20. Data sources: Reuters, TD AmeritradeApple Unveils New Products, but Declines on Providing Guidance AAPL's fiscal Q3 meant COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, store closures, and its seasonally weakest earnings period. Turns out that AAPL ended up posting a blowout earnings report with growth up 11% year over year--setting a record for the June quarter. Ending the quarter with record achievement, AAPL offered a 4-for-1 stock split in August, aiming to make shares accessible to a broader range of investors, according to the company's press release.Despite iPhone sales rising a mere 2% in FYQ4, the company saw double-digit growth in iPad, Mac, and wearables, setting record sales for its June quarter (again, seasonally the slowest for AAPL). Many of these products appeared to be useful to consumers during the quarantine period, pushing demand higher. Looking forward to AAPL's October 29 earnings report for FY Q4, the tech giant declined to give guidance. However, the company said it expects to see strong year-over-year performance across all product categories, which maybe means a continuation of the same growth trend.Also, remember that the company recently introduced its first 5G model iPhones and a bunch of health, fitness, and various other product upgrades. But you might have to wait a few quarters to see how the adoption of these new features impacts AAPL's bottom line.As always with AAPL, investors will likely be watching the company's services growth, as that segment grows in importance vs. iPhones.Chipmakers Looking Chipper On an industry level, chips may be trailing software and hardware in year-to-date market perfornance, but if you look at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), the industry's gains of 29% are on the heels of COMP, and far outperforming SPX.The story over the last few quarters is technologies helping people thrive despite the pandemic's restrictions. Semiconductor chips provide the basic foundation for all of these apps and gadgets to work. So seeing chipmakers turn red hot should be no surprise.Topping the news earlier this month was the Wall Street Journal report on AMD's potential acquisition of rival chipmaker Xilinx, Inc (NASDAQ: XLNX), a deal estimated at $30 billion. Along with data centers processors, desktop and notebook computers, AMD also makes chips for game systems (think Xbox and PlayStation), all in high demand in the current and potentially future "remote" work and play environment. Adding XLNX to the mix may give AMD a larger stake in the telecommunications space making its position against rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) even more competitive. AMD is set to report earnings on October 27, though that date hasn't yet been confirmed.The truth is, nobody knows what the future holds with regard to the post-pandemic work, school, and entertainment environment. It may even be too early to say "post-pandemic" Regardless, semis--and the Tech sector in general--may be well-positioned to offer much-needed services whether we find ourselves in locked down or reopening. Either way, software, hardware, and those little chips that power it all aren't going away.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC.

Zoom Stock Is a Winner, But How Much Higher Can It Go?
While the coronavirus has had devastating consequences for many companies, the inverse is also true. Several names have grabbed on to COVID's coattails and used it to post incredible growth in 2020.None more so than Zoom Video Communications (ZM). The video conferencing platform has arguably been the pandemic’s main beneficiary and has become almost a consumer staple, serving everyone and everything from schools to small businesses to event hosting and online conferences.But considering the stock has already surged by 721% so far this year, is it wise to take out a position right now? It is, according to BTIG analyst Matthew VanVliet.After attending the company’s annual user conference, Zoomtopia, the analyst believes the growth story is set to continue.“Overall the growth of the company has been unprecedented but as it expands well beyond a video-conferencing tool into a core human interaction platform forever augmenting how multi-modal interactions evolve into the future, the growth trajectory appears to only slow slightly,” VanVliet said. “While much of the legacy environment is simply treading water, Zoom is pushing the envelope on product innovation and what the future of work / re-opening will actually look like rather than trying to form-fit existing tech to previous issues, which we believe will help Zoom emerge as the leading video platform that is pervasive across the entire IT landscape.”During the event, the company gave updates on its platform’s expansion, laid out its intentions for the next few years, including plans to improve long-term margins, and gave updates around Zoom Phone.Zoom Phone, VanVliet says, is a “$23 billion opportunity driving international growth.” The cloud-calling solution is now used in 43 countries, boasts over 5,800 customers with more than 10 employees, and “is just starting to benefit from its growing channel ecosystem.”Even though as much as half of the global market is international, roughly only 25% of the company’s TTM (trailing twelve months) revenue was generated outside the U.S., implying to VanVliet, the international opportunity is “a long-term growth driver.”Accordingly, VanVliet rates Zoom shares a Buy. (To watch VanVliet’s track record, click here)All in all, Wall Street has mixed feelings on Zoom’s trajectory. Based on 12 Buys, 13 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. However, the analysts expect shares to decline by 16% in the year ahead, going by the $467.55 average price target.

Zoom Wants to Partner With, Not Defeat, Slack and Microsoft
(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan said the company will do a better job integrating office chatroom products from Slack Technologies Inc. and Microsoft Corp., betting that cooperation is better than competition for the software maker’s growth.“Chat is a very important functionality for our overall usage,” Yuan said Wednesday during an online meeting with analysts. “The core priority is how to further improve the integration between chat, video and voice.”Customers are satisfied with Zoom’s current chat sidebar during videoconferences and the company isn’t interested in chasing Slack and Microsoft Teams by delving further into the market, he added.“We really integrate very well with Slack, with Teams,” Yuan said. “We give customers flexibility. We are picking a very open-minded approach. We are not saying we want to build our own chat to compete against others. I don’t think we need that, because video and voice, that’s our focus.”Slack’s shares lifted to a session high of $33.27 at 3:51 p.m. in New York on the news that Zoom didn’t pose a competitive threat, before closing at $32.73. Zoom’s stock, which has jumped more than sevenfold this year, declined 1.8% to $509.25.Earlier, Zoom unveiled a raft of new products and initiatives during its Zoomtopia user conference in a bid to maintain its explosive revenue growth of the past six months during the coronavirus pandemic. The company pitched itself as an integral platform in the digital economy, at the center of corporate workflows and a hub for users who’d like to throw free, paid or charity events while people socially distance.Zoom also updated investors on revised financial goals, saying it is targeting a long-term adjusted operating margin of 25% of revenue, and a gross margin of 80% of revenue. Under this framework, the company would spend 10% to 12% of revenue on research and development and 30% to 35% on sales and marketing. The company didn’t specify a time frame for those goals.Zoom’s meteoric rise has put it in a better competitive standing against Microsoft than many of its cloud-based application peers. Yuan said he hopes to partner more in the future with the world’s largest software maker even though Microsoft has a rival videoconferencing service called Teams.Yuan said he doesn’t wake up thinking about Microsoft as a “top competitor,” but instead sees his company as a good partner for the software giant since Microsoft’s messaging and file-sharing tools, for example, work well with Zoom’s meeting, phone and webinar services.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

P/E Ratio Insights for Zoom Video Communications
In the current market session, Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM) is trading at $505.60, after a 2.54% drop. However, over the past month, the stock spiked by 23.87%, and in the past year, by 654.29%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 4.56%.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.View more earnings on ZMDepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Zoom Video Communications Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 656.7 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 121.15 of the Software industry. Ideally, one might believe that Zoom Video Communications Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued.There are many limitations to P/E ratio.

Zoom's Mania And An Impossible Valuation
ZM soared over 35% following the release of undeniably strong earnings, but the underlying valuation looks unsustainable.Revenue for 2H is only expected to be marginally better than Q2, so ZM is facing decelerating revenue on a QoQ basis.Customer mix shifted more in favor of small customers who are billing monthly instead of annually and likely to contribute to higher churn rates.Net margin forecast at ~31% for FY21 is likely to be unsustainable as ZM scales costs and operations to meet demand.Even with net margin at ~31%, shares are still trading at a high forward P/E premium, but a more reasonable 26% or 17% net margin has a more dire outlook.
